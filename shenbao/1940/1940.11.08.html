<h3 id="c6">羅斯福氏勝利的意義 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>「公意與常識的勝利！這是本報昨日社評所述觀感，倫敦星報則呼爲「民治主義的勝利」；在此國際秩序震撼欲墜，凄厲的黑暗，猙獰的光燄，滋長瀰漫，幾乎籠罩全世界的時期，羅斯福氏以其政策與事績，獲得絕大多數國民擁護，破美國總統祇連二任的歷史成例，臀選而連任三决爲白宮主人，繼續其政柄八年乃至十二年；凡屬明辨黑白薰蕕，崇尚正義，珍惜文明的人羣，對此羅氏勝利所得印象，深信其必與本報與星報相彷髴。</p>
<p>羅斯福氏隸民主黨，競選失敗了的威爾基氏隸共和黨，一勝一敗，原非兩黨兩人之間，乃有黑白薰蕕善惡文野之別；兩黨兩人在競選中宣示其抱負。闡明其政策。且可謂無甚區別；蓋當前大計，諸以針對國際變局而謀內政外交之務與適應爲主，兩黨兩人對此所稱述的原則同，預示其具體作爲的力援中英兩國亦同：乃終於一勝一敗者，至少可以堅强而透闢的證明了下列兩要點：（一）民主黨的國際政策，絕對光明偉大而準確，故共和黨雖與對立抗衡，而所標榜政策絕對無法超越或修正民主黨政策的範疇，更遑論標新立異而與民主黨政策相背而馳；由此更可想像，假如共和黨提示了反對原來政策以事競選，則得票必允少，失敗且允慘。（一）羅斯福氏主政八年，大刀闊斧，敢作敢爲，揆以政治得失的沒有絕對。有一利必有一弊的一般現象，則當然儘多褒貶毀譽的餘地；對方加以反對與攻擊，豈特小患無辭，且得振振有辭，然而小若對方奔走三萬里之多，竟得多數擁護；可見事功把握了社會信仰，德操與赤誠抓住了全國民心：這是政治家政治生命的基本源泉，以此當國臨衆，更可舉重若輕，以此推進政策，當如風行草偃。這不是偶然倖致的。這也絕對小像東方觀念，以爲大權在握，根深蒂固，有何種行政的財政的勢力可以假借爲競選的憑藉而制勝。不但如此，他却別有兩種無情的弱點：一是力援中英兩國的政策，犯了濃厚的準備參戰嫌疑；故攻擊他的人，甚至鼓煽擁有鉅量選票的婦女界，謂要防止目己的丈夫與兒子去拼命打仗的賢妻良母，應該反對準備參戰的羅某：這是何等犀利，何等驚心盪魄的冷箭啊？二是美國國父華盛頓，眞可謂豐功偉烈，衆望愛戴，但是他却以免得終身兀首，葆養共和精神爲理由，謝絕了第三决當選連任而退隱；故美國總統祇任兩决，不祗是機械的方式的歷史成例，且是具有嚴肅意義而有關政本的最高道德軌範；只此一端，非羅斯福氏以前的任何前仟賢哲總統所願破例，亦非所得破例；允不但如此而已，羅斯福氏的八年新政，極權政制的一時披靡，早已使羅氏犯了企圖獨裁的濃厚嫌疑；如此莊嚴的歷史信條，如此惡劣的形跡與環境，在已經連了二任的羅斯福氏，簡直是無可譬解，無可抗違的「大限」已至，惟有撒手一法了。羅氏現在竟得克服這兩種無情的弱點，這是羅氏的奇蹟，亦是美國的奇蹟，決非偶然所可倖致；然而這也正是所以反映了國際在凄厲的黑暗之下，猙獰的光燄之中，旣臻如何危險的程度，至少使美國國民感覺到現在所遭遇的，今後有待應付的，乃爲歷史所未有了！</p>
<p>以政略而論，羅斯福氏競勝的機樞，不在現在而在旣往，現在僅由國民投票表而出之。他邀的共和黨的史汀生與諾克斯二氏分担國政，執掌海陸兩軍部；原邀的敵黨俊彥，携手共事，是大公，必自信，非大智大勇不辦，在美國亦爲破例之舉，可皆難能，然未足稱奇：而二氏欣然應命，豈騖高官厚祿而背黨，是有互信存乎其間，是有使命超越乎其黨：當二氏就職之頃，可謂羅氏旣勝。抑羅氏所勝，豈是續主白宮？昨日華府電訉：美國自來平分勞動界陣營，雙方幾如敵國的總工會與工業組織大會，將因羅斯福的成功而歸併爲一，這是極有深長意義的一大事，此其一。羅斯福氏擬羅致競選失敗了的威爾基氏，共謀國防，或且畀爲國防委員會主席；實現與吾不可知，但在兩黨對立而競選勝利者的意態上，人人可以確認其性質的絕非祿位羈縻，而別有功用，此其一。威爾基氏失敗了，其實每决競選，必有一敗，失敗者「行所無事」可也：而威氏卻有誠懇而坦白的文告，謂「美國民選，表示了吾人民治原則的生動。余知共和黨同志亦將如余繼續工作，以謀全民團結，完成防務」；又謂必「繼續援助中英，並消滅美利堅境內的仇視」；這在任何政黨當國時期，對於敵黨所求之不得的珍貴諾言，現在共和黨自發諾言，民主黨不求自得，說明了美國今後國際政策的獲有全國全民爲之後盾，此其三。這三者，是現在已經顯示的羅斯福氏在競選勝利以外的空前勝利！</p>

<p>由柳州到南寧</p>
<p>南寗中央社時派記者劉行舟電我們離開柳江、向這個重大歷史事件發生地前進、平時山柳州到南寗、中間有着一叫九公里的距離、乘汽車也不過是一日的路程、現在我們却足足的走了四日兩夜、因爲汽車僅能通到賓陽以南上數公里的一個小鎮、此後的路程、就全靠兩條我們在汽車的顚簸中、度過漫漫長夜、到達行車終點時、已是十一月裹的第一個黎明、興奮驅逐了困倦、立卽徒步前進、當午到達賓陽縣屬最後的一個鄉鎮思隴</p>
<p>思隴在南寗克復前是邕賓、邕武兩路的第一個前進補給站、爲了適應軍事上的需要、賓陽縣政府在這裹設立了辦事處、戰區當局和廣西綏署、也會同在此建立了一座軍民合作的橋樑、軍民合作站、他們終日在忙着徵夫救護·修路·架橋和採辦兩糧等等的工作、不單是軍隊、就是和軍事有關的其他過路的人、也得到他們不少的幫助我們在此地的食住打、便是他們幫忙解決的、</p>
<p>日人爲什麼放棄南寗、這裹的人們、設有一個人會提出過這樣的問題、他們一致堅信日人早已在軍事上、經濟上、以及自然環境上、走人了絕境、安置在危崖上的枯木、是經不起暴風雨的吹襲的、沒有基礎的建築、也必會爲人衆所擠倒、這道理他們曉得的、比我們曉得的更淸楚、</p>
<p>南寗克復後、已經三天、不見日機的活動、但當我們剛剛行抵崑崙關的時候、却發現一隻飛行極低的日擬、在頭頂掠過接着伸聽得炸彈聲四響、在背後不遠的地方爆起、事後知道思隴被炸、我們的一個旅伴、因爲留在思隴僱民夫、腿部受了微傷、</p>
<p>崑崙關是記者的舊游之地、但現時景物縱然和春間作戰時不同、現在山上已建起陣亡將士的陵園、</p>
<p>崑崙關直至七塘路上、遺留着無數的鐵絲網、和其他的障礙物、公路也破壞得特別厲害、幾乎無一座完整的橋樑、七塘五瑭問公路、雖還相常完整、但橋樑也都破壞了、公路兩面的村莊房舍、已完全被日機炸毀、由於各村莊房舍蕩然無存、沿途很難見到民衆、因此我們的食宿、都發生了問題、從思隴到五塘、整整走了十九個小時、從第一决早餐、到第二决早餐、中問距離着二十六個小時、此外幷沒有吃到任何東西、這中間的睡眠、也只有兩小時、那是在一條河畔之夜的草地上、</p>
<p>在離開柳州的第四天的上午、我們通過叫塘五塘、入四塘雖只有一小時的行程、但這兩條地方的情形、卻完全不同、原來四塘是日軍在邕賓路的第一個前進據點、在那裹映入感官的一切事物、都沾染了一種異族的色彩、酒瓶·罐頭·盒·破碎的軍用品狼藉滿地、特別入眼的是村後叫座燒屍窟、周圍還堆着很多的柴草、村前幾座小山上的防禦工事、一點也未破壞、每個工事、都是以大的容納一小隊的兵的堡壘、和兩道鐵絲網構成的、網上掛滿了空罐頭、這就是他們用以防範偷襲的警鈴、在靠近鐵絲網的缺口的上、我們的工兵寫下的（小心地雷）的警告、緊張了每個行人的心情、以後每一座橋樑、或一片泥地、都寫着同樣的警語、這不是開玩笑、事實上、沿途要知被日人埋藏多少地雷、當找們越過四塘三公里左右、聽到地雷的爆炸聲、從四塘方面飄來、每個行路人、都不的而同的回頭望了一望、然後以犛異的眼光、互相凝视一下、再繼續前進、這時大宗都擔心著通過四塘的後來者的命運、</p>
<p>叫塘南寗面的公路·橋樑·電話桿綫完全沒有損壞、僅有兩根電桿印上了幾條標語、但幷未被砍斷、可見日人退走時、幷不怎樣從容、同時、我們發見雨後的公路上、印着雜亂的釘靴印和十數條不合轍的汽車印、就足記明日人的退走、是相當倉惶的、</p>
<p>在四塘　到口口口將軍、他同着他的幾位高級幕僚、研究日人遺十來的—事、在三塘又會到黃旭初主席、他們在兩州比我們遲走一天、但由於交通條件之充分利用、他們却縮短了一天的行程、最後和我們同日進入南寗、</p>
<p>在南寗近郊、首先映入我們眼簾的大建築物、是廣西省家畜保護所、和南寗汽車站、前者一切都還完整、後者則已破壞不堪、轉過汽車站、就是巍崇壯偉的南寗城、城頭高聳着、國旗迎風招展、象徵着國運復興、和南寗的新生、平日國旗看得太泛了、因此幷不能每决都給人們以一種新的感覺、但此時此地的國旗、却在人們心情上發生了一種有力的不可名狀的激動我們以整肅的步伐、載着一顆歡躍的心、進入南寗取的北門、在城門口所看見的第一條標語、是（請南寧的同胞回來、重整家園）、（六日電）</p>

<p>加里寧氏發表演說</p>
<p>莫斯科　十一月六日、蘇聯最高議會主席團主席加里寗、在莫斯科蘇維埃及民衆團體集會中發表演說稱、「蘇聯政府成立之第廿三年、在蘇聯歷史上、將成爲外交及社會主義建設重要成功之年份、據可靠統計一九四〇年工業產量將增加一三·六〇〇·〇〇〇盧布、較一九三九年增百份之十一、此項數字尚未包括西烏克蘭·白俄羅斯及其他新蘇維埃共和邦在內、金屬及煤產量在增加中、例如與去年同月比較、本年七月份煤產量計增百份之一一二、八月份增百份之一一四·三、九月份增百份之一一六、至於普通之重工業、在本年下半年已提高其產量、輕工業工作成績亦甚滿意、鐵路方面、業已完成其緊急任務、本年氣候雖惡劣、但農業收穫甚佳、五穀收穫達七十萬萬普特、被捲人戰爭之西歐國家、糧食已成爲嚴重問題、此外、未加入戰爭各國之農業收穫、亦不甚佳妙」、</p>
<p>採取步驟發展工業</p>
<p>至此、加里寗乃演述本年度蘇聯政府對發展工業所採取之各種步驟、例如每天八小時工作、每星期七天工作制度之實施、嚴禁擅離職守及動員後備勞動力量等措置、述及外交政策時、加里寗云、「蘇聯此决對芬作戰、費力不少、天時地理均不利蘇軍、森林·霜雪以及零度叫十度下之氣候、使紅車無從發展彼等之技術、雖然、蘇聯軍隊已顯示全世界任何障礙均不能阻止彼等前進、經過三個月之戰事、芬蘭被迫媾和、和的條件、係由蘇方建議、腐敗之小資本主義報紙、初尚企圖破壞紅軍之聲譽、但最後亦不得不在其報中承認彼等確因圖破壞紅軍聲譽、而傳播虛僞消息、本人深信、吾軍事當局必可將眞相在報紙中發表、此决參加蘇芬戰役者、其中四百零五人已獲得蘇聯英雄榮銜、其他獲得獎狀者更不可勝計、卽就此種數字觀之、已可證明紅軍之英勇戰蹟、蘇聯民衆對紅軍之愛護、良有以也、</p>
<p>增加人口二千餘萬</p>
<p>自愛沙尼亞·立陶宛·拉脫維亞歸併蘇聯後、蘇聯之土地及人口大增、查該三國之併入蘇聯極爲重要、此種事實本人從未在歷史上見及之、資本階級統治該三國凡二十年、無時不在煽動人民對蘇之仇視、但仍未能阻止人民對蘇聯之同情、該三國舊政府車實上並不能獲得人民之擁護、彼等被迫以政權讓與人民政府、爲順從民衆之意見、人民政府請求加入蘇聯、結果該三國現已成爲蘇聯同等之共和邦、此爲該三國人民愛護蘇聯之明證、本年度歷史上一重要錯誤業已改正、比薩拉比亞已與蘇聯重新團結一致、吾人應勿忘羅馬尼亞資本家之毫無信義，在上屆世界大戰中、俄爲羅之同盟、俄軍會助羅抗德、但羅資本家竟乘吾國革命初告成功時之軍事弱點、强行奪取吾人之一部份領土、目前吾人已克服比薩拉比亞及北布柯維納、至於該兩區人民對併入蘇聯情緒之然烈、無庸贅述、當吾紅軍抵達時、彼等必可感覺之、由是觀之、二千三百禺人民、已在本年中加入蘇聯、彼等已獲得蘇聯公民之一切權利（首先爲服役紅軍之光榮任務）、目前愛沙尼亞·立陶宛·拉脫維亞之軍隊均已併入紅軍、此點已證明蘇聯民族團結之堅强爲歷史上所未見</p>
<p>不能置身戰禍之外</p>
<p>目前、全世界幾均陷於戰爭中、在强國中、祇有蘇聯置身戰禍之外、嚴守中立、如此劇烈之戰爭、對於中立國富不無影響、但能避免捲人戰禍、誠可謂大幸、雖然此種倖運決非偶然、此係由於吾人國內之成就及外交政策之成功、同時亦係吾領袖努力之結果、而指導吾國經濟、外交及軍事者厥爲斯達林同志、目前之國際局勢、已使吾人對一切發展、無法繼續站於不偏、不倚、旁觀者及冷靜觀察者之地位、此種局勢已予每一蘇聯公民一項重要任務、蘇聯爲世界上惟一僅有之社會主義國家、勞動大衆現已獲得眞正之祖國、此種事實、在歷史上尚屬初見、吾人目前之第一重要任務、厥爲鞏固吾社會主美祖國之經濟及國防力量、工人·作家·美術家及所有一切之蘇聯公民、必須盡其能力、進一步鞏固社會主義國家之國力、此亦卽蘇聯民衆完成對世界無產階級任務之意、在此爲共產主義而努力之奮鬥中、吾人係由共黨及斯達材同志所領導、値此偉大十月革命紀念之際、吾人謹以至高熱誠、向吾人之領袖偉大的斯達林致賀，（七日塔斯社電）</p>

<p>美國新近當選副總統亨利華萊士，是一位篤信宗敎，熟讀聖經的人。他在農業部長任內七年，部員都熟知他對於渺不相涉的事，也要引經據典。</p>
<p>華萊士的宗敎信仰，自幼本屬於長老會，九年之前，却轉入了監理會。他接受聖經班領袖之職，成爲牧師助手。他在幾個月中，每逢星期日，總是身穿法衣，跪在祭壇面前虔祈禱告。他在一九三三年到華盛頓任農業部長以後，仍照常參加禮拜，不過他有比衆不同的一點，寗可走過白宮區內富麗煇煌的敎堂，而選擇東南部一所冷靜的禮拜堂。</p>
<p>華萊士的性質，雖帶着神秘色彩，却是聰明過人，而且精於科學。常他離開埃華伐州立農業學校後五年，卽擬就第一個預測玉蜀黍和猪市塲的比例表，因此聲譽鵲起。他在優生學方面，曾實騐玉蜀黍栽培法，改良種植，所以遠在他有入閣希望之前，早已博得「抵抗飢餓的大戰士」之稱。他曾硏究拿破倫戰後的歐洲情形，並預言美國戰後農業的衰落。當他出任農業部長時，已是一位經濟家，科學家，統計家，兼大膽的幻想家了。</p>
<p>關於華萊士的幼年，外間有一個傳說。言者鑿鑿似若可信。據云他生長在埃華伐田莊，景况凄凉，祇有愛犬一頭作伴。實則華萊士並完全不生長田莊，他的生活亦並不孤寂。是一個長子，以一八八八年十月七日生於埃華伐州亞台爾地方，以下接連生了五個弟妹，所以他在家中並不寂寞。實際華萊士雖生在田莊，却是長在城市，並非一個十足的鄉下人。</p>
<p>華萊士的家庭環境和家族遺傳，幫助他形成了一生的事業。他家一共有三個亨利華萊士，他是老三。亨利華萊士老大是他的祖父，曾在台蒙斯設肆經商，還創辦一個定期刋物，名喚華萊士農業雜誌。他在鄉問頗有聲望，大家都稱他做「亨利叔叔」。他本來是一個長老會牧師，因爲體弱多病，遷居鄉間務農。他時常投函埃華伐州的報紙，於是漸漸的成爲一個新聞記者。「亨利叔叔自己做編輯的時候，報紙中充滿着懇切動人的敎訓，把「優良的耕種，淸明的思想，正當的生活」做格言，至今依然存在。他的報紙，在美國中西部引起農民的公衆利益思想，厥功甚偉。政府曾以農業部長一席相畀，他因淡於功名，辭而不就，他的兒子孫子，後來却相繼擔任此職。當他在一九一六年逝世時·卽出他的兒子亨利華萊士老二繼仟農業雜誌編輯。</p>
<p>亨利華萊士老三，就是這位當選的副總統。當他米入學校之前，有一個黑人名喚卡佛的，想成爲一個有名的植物學家，到阿美斯硏究，會受華萊士父親照顧。他感激之餘，便時常携着華萊士出游，沿途指點，說明各種植物的區別。經此循循善誘，華萊士年方八齡，卽已開始實騐異種交配法，很得到卡佛的贊計。</p>
<p>後來舉家遷移到台蒙斯，華萊士仍繼續用花卉草苺作實騐。及在校中學習算學，又傾向於收集統計。當他圔家赴鄉間放行的時候，他的弟妹各帶紙筆，把沿途所見的地坑，猪欄，牛馬等物，一一記錄。</p>
<p>他十七歲時，曾在家中所辦定期刊物的事務所參觀一玉蜀黍展覽會，由阿美斯來的玉</p>
<p>華萊士之家庭蜀黍專家擔任評判。華萊士目光灼灼，隨着他的指點品評而轉移。等到發獎旣畢，游人盡散，祇有華萊士仍直立不動。他藍灰色的兩眼中，露着懷疑的神氣。評判昌異而問之。華萊士赧然說道，埃華伐的玉蜀黍，原爲養猪而種植，若按美觀評判，是吾適當，猪本是蠢物懂得什麼審美！評判昌聞言，笑而不怒，却將一袋得獎的三十三種玉蜀黍給他，囑他種植後再去自已評判。</p>
<p>華萊士携歸種於後園，至秋結實，分別採下，一一計數，至於連夕不睡。他發覺得到首獎的玉蜀黍種，產量列入最少的十種內，而醜惡畸形的玉蜀黍種，收穫却最豐富。這是他農業試騐成功的起點。此後二十年中，他每天晚上，和星期六星期日的白天，總是孜孜不倦，從事硏究，積下的筆記，高可盈尺，製成精密的記錄和無窮的算式。至一九二〇年，他的混合種玉蜀黍居然獲得獎賞，還創立了一個評判玉蜀黍的新標準。</p>
<p>他誰阿美斯專門學校以後，還有不少的創舉。他讀營養化學的時候，對於學說方面發生疑問。他便暫充做一頭實騐的豚鼠，去試騐他自已的理想。他先斷食一星期，察看有無事故發生。直到第七天，他從小販車上得到一批橘子，他的絕食方此終止。繼而他又試騐根據硏究所得的若干種簡單飲食。他腦海中蓄着一個理想，要計劃出一種價値最低的生活維持費，他希望每天所耗能不超過美金五分。</p>
<p>他對於飲食的好奇性，至今依然存僕。他在部長任內，曾五年不知肉味，自信人類沒有肉食，一樣可以康健。他也曾試飮過豆腐漿，却因胃口不合，祇得放棄。</p>
<p>一九二一年，他的父親以共和黨哈定總統羅致入閣，任農業部長，他就承繼了華萊士農業的誌的編輯一職。戰後的農村不景氣，這時已經開始，他的社評總是主張自動减少生產，以適應國外市場的縮小。他又抱着佈道員的熱心，向農民集會傳佈他的福音。他雖不善演說，却總是眼望天花板，講得無休無歇。農民們也很歡喜他，但不懂他把地方困難和歐洲情形聯在一起，究竟是什麼意思。親友見他失敗，用言加以勸慰，他總說是「我們所受的苦想還未够。」他深信堅苦卓絕，可以發人深省。</p>
<p>農民對他，雖然不表同情，還有誠實，但蒙斯的商人，却不肯加以原諒。某决他在午餐俱樂部中演說，有一個會員起立指着他道：「亨利華萊士，你是個危險的人物呀。」</p>
<p>哈定總統亦覺得這個靑年華萊士是個危險人物。有一天，他把農業部長招呼到面前，冷冷的授給他一篇華萊士農業雜誌的評論，問他「你是贊成我還在反對我。」原來這一篇評論中，把哈定的航萊補助計劃，攻擊得體無完膚。華萊士的父親祇得聲期報頭上面雖仍用着他的名字，實際却由他兒子完全負責，哈定也祇得罷了</p>
<p>一九二九年八月，當華萊士正在國外參加國際農業會議時，他家中竟不顧他的電報抗議，收買了另一家農村報紙，和華萊十農業雜誌合仿。這時正値不景氣時代開始，一會兒便把華萊士全家的資本虧耗　凈。幸而這報館的新主人　　華萊士做編輯，皆以全融自由。華萊士在此後所作的評論中，有許多霜句，羅斯福於一九三二年競選擇動中曾引用。</p>
<p>華萊士的得認羅斯福，是由於現比財政部長摩根稻的介紹，當時祗知道他是一們農木家和農村雜誌的發行人。羅斯福於一九三兒年請華萊士至海特公園私紙，從此一見如故，深相結納。</p>
<p>是年十一月，埃華代州卽投入羅斯福的懷抱，於叫十年來第一决投着民主黨票。選舉勝利後，華萊士父和羅斯福會談過一决，所以他的被邀入閣，擔任農業部長並不出人意外</p>
<p>華萊士就任農華部長後的第一件事，便把他父親的書像，從黑暗的走廊中移掛在他辦公桌上方，可以時刻相對。當新政施行之初，他頗不拘形跡，衣服臃釐，箕踞而坐。有時上午在附近球塲中拍球，若遇天雨，仍穿着短襪。他初入會塲，輒拘拘謹，未及會終，已能操縱自如了。</p>
<p>按照普通標準，華萊士兮日仍是一個宴人。他祇在台蒙斯的某玉蜀黍公司有一些穩固的收人。他的夫人却擁有較多的股票。他的部長年俸是一萬五千美元，生平所得，以此爲最多。</p>
<p>華萊士夫人性情溫和，容貌美麗，對於丈夫的怪癖頗能容忍。她是埃華伐州伊洛白魯納人，在特萊克大學時由姊妹行的介紹，始與華萊士相識，至一九一四年結成夫婦。</p>

<p>邇來黃豆市面、因天津靑島二路來源不絕、其他到頭亦不乏、故銷場不暢、市氣不易振作、前日一度在貨主貶價引胃之下、辦胃曾呈活絡之態、但昨市雖得香港帮續來問津、然胃納又見减色、故大局依然不晚長疲短俏之格、昨統祗成交天津豆六七百包、價爲三十八元至三十七兀、桑園豆二百包、價爲三十元零五角而已、</p>

<h3 id="c78">貴州敎育最近設施　提倡高級工業職業敎育　增加各級校敎職員待遇 <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>（貴陽通訊）貴州省敎育廳長歐元懷、本年五月蒞任以來、積極工作、茲將最近敎育設施、摘要錄下、</p>
<p>（一）創立省立高級工業職業學校該省省立職業學校、原僅三所、而普通中學則有十九、職業學校中之工業班級、尤為不多、為補救此種畸形發展、並應省內各種新興工業之需要計、亟應創立一工業職業校、以培養適宜人材、因於本年六月開始籌設省立高級工業職業濘、聘高炯為籌委會主任委員、該校經常費、每年預算十萬五千元、校址勘定在貴陽附近、已興工建築校舍、先設機械土木兩科、並開始招生兩班、名額一百名卽如期開學上課、</p>
<p>（二）設立編審室　貴州敎廳原無編審室、歐廳長蒞任、卽予設立、重要工作、為編輯貴州敎育月刋、編輯各科補充敎材及現行敎育法令、將來希望編審室一面內部自行研究各項實際問題、而以研究結果、供各方參考、一面更推動全省敎育工作人員之研究、以改進其自身之工作、而逐漸趨於行政學術化、</p>
<p>（三）舉辦中學敎師暑期講習討論會　中學敎師暑期講習討論會、每年原皆舉行、今年奉到部令、為時已晚、日貴州中等學校、暑假期不過一月有餘、而交通不便、往返需時、故今年舉辦、因難特多、惟以此事幫助中學敎師之進修、所關極大敎廳終不顧任何困難毅然舉行、雖為時倉促、而全省各地敎師之來參加者、仍有八十九人、計分各科講習討論、又種講座—貴州講座、抗戰講座、國際問題講座、—以及軍事訓管精神講話等、各科講師、多屬大夏浙大湘雅等大學著名敎授、各種講座主座、亦多實際負責之主管人員、所講無不認眞、八月底該會結束、學員尙覺臨別依依、恨為期太短可見該會此次辦理之認眞、無怪各方均一致給予好評、</p>

<p>— 佩苓</p>
<p>在公共租界的各種車輛中，十六路電車是最軋最不淸潔和最慢的車子，我爲了住家的關係，每天在這車上出進，在路上—起點至終點—竟要化了一時的工夫。但我或許乘慣了，倒很願意乘它，而且，在天兩决一百多分鐘中，在車中所見到的，所聽到的，有各種不同的人物，各種不的語調，以及各種不同的神情這幾乎是整個社會的縮影，就把昨天從三洋涇橋回家一時中所見到的，聽到的，寫在下面，來證明我的話吧。車子在四馬路停了之後，頭等車廂裹除我之外，才多了三個人。一個是巡捕，還有兩個是一起的。車上多了三個人之後，才漸漸熱鬧起來，實在那個巡捕也和我一樣的沉默，所熱鬧者只是那兩人而已：那兩人很喜歡講話，從上車一直到下車沒有停過。</p>
<p>『昨天夜裹怎麽樣？勝敗？』</p>
<p>「唔！不談不談！吃敗仗！四十六千！』戴眼鏡的答方臉。</p>
<p>「你怎麽會輸了的！我以爲同這兩個人來，總可以寫爲意意的。」方臉一面說一面付了錢買了兩張一角二分的票子。</p>
<p>『倒霉！不知道怎麽會輸的。』戴眼鏡的搖搖頭。</p>
<p>巡捕下去了，上來一男一女，和三個學生，馬上搶着位子坐下來。</p>
<p>『稟子？啥地方？』售票員伸開手。</p>
<p>『Season！』三位同時點一點頭。</p>
<p>『她媽的！今天「冬瓜」怎麽這樣兇？』中問一個拿皮箱的問旁邊。</p>
<p>『哈人曉得！娘格我看也看不着，李之明這小鬼又不肯「派司」過來！』穿西裝的指着其餘的一個。</p>
<p>『叫我那能「派司」法呢？「冬瓜」一直站在我面前。』叫李之明的回答。</p>
<p>從這幾句話裏，一聽就知道這三位在考試的時候吃着「苦頭」了。</p>
<p>這時車裏的人漸漸多了兩位從四馬路上來的談了一大陣話以後，下車去了。坐在他們位置上的是兩個鄉下人，其中一個兩腿之間夾着一袋米，不知怎麽一來，車子忽然停了一下，乘客們同時向右邊一衝，那一袋米也因之倒下來，於是米像石灰似的倒出一半。那兩個鄉下人連忙蹲下去用手捧起來再裝進袋裏，認眞的工作着。這立刻引起乘客們的議論：</p>
<p>『哎呀！罪過罪過！』</p>
<p>『這觸老那能介弗當心！』</p>
<p>穿西裝的學生指着蹲在地上的鄉下人向其餘的兩個朋友說。</p>
<p>『嗨！起碼要頭二十塊錢！』一位大塊頭笑著說。</p>
<p>『不止的！不止的此地總有五斗米，格沒要四十幾塊哩！』另外一個說。</p>
<p>賣票員也來插嘴：</p>
<p>『窮人夠吃幾天哩！』</p>
<p>兩個鄉下人剛工作完了坐起來的時候，車子忽然又是一停，接着鈴連響了五下，賣票員連忙用了很大的聲音向三等裹叫：</p>
<p>『OK！』那邊回答一句挺神氣的。</p>
<p>車子停了，下去幾個，兩個鄉下人扛著米讓着「對不住」，也下去了。上來一個藍眼睛高鼻子的查票，查得很認眞，幸而查票員在五下鈴響中一布置一完竣，沒有吃着「排頭」，吃着「排頭」的倒是叫李之明的那個學生，原因是「Season」拿不出，在下一站被「羅宋人一趕去，並且罰了變倍的車錢。</p>
<p>『魏老闆！哈地方去？』坐在靠門口的一個戴鴨舌帽著工人裝得向剛上車的一位穿大衣的人招呼。</p>
<p>『唔！曹家渡！』那位「魏老板」一面回答，一面舉一舉手，賣票員便向他旁邊的一個人賣票了。</p>
<p>『你上哪兒去「？」魏老板』帶着點山東口音。</p>
<p>『也是曹家渡。』帶鴨舌帽的笑了一笑。</p>
<p>『這兩天生意多吧？』</p>
<p>『還好還好！小生意。』又笑了一笑。</p>
<p>由於旁邊兩人的切切私語，我方才知道這兩位—戲鴨舌帽和「魏老板」—是怎樣的人物，而所謂生意又是怎麽一回事，但我袋裹沒有多錢，身上旣無手錶，又無大衣，也不必「杞人憂天」，儘管放心，而且離開目的地也只有三站路了。</p>

<p>— 茜</p>
<p>時間的巨輪交上了秋季，大家就忽忙地辦着大事—婚嫁大事。你看，報上訂婚結婚的廣告，登得多末熱鬧。再不妨到南京路上去作一次巡禮，幾家大公司都是人山人海；他（她）們有的辦着嫁妝，有的却爲了「吃喜酒」而預備起時裝。仔細計算起他們這筆費用。眞是驚人。婚嫁兩方互換的什麽聘金，手飾之類不算，單是幾十桌山珍海錯（包括其附加費用），非千元就不能應付週到；其他的零星支出更無從計算。為他們的婚事，而影響及於讀親友所耗得更多；尤其是女子，心好時髦，到了結婚禮堂上，就容易互相爭妍。所謂平時刻得緊些，塲面不得不顧</p>
<p>有一個朋友的夫人，爲了其表妹的出嫁，會費了近乎二百元的金錢，來舉辦參婚禮的服裝。我曾代她作過一個計算計的：夾大衣一件八十元，夾旗袍三十元，新式高跟鞋二十幾元，眞絲襪十幾元，電燙頭髮四元，修指甲一元，其他胭脂花粉不計，已達百數十元；她自己還是老大的不滿意這些—她一個人所耗如是，則其總數，能不駭聞！</p>
<p>會聽到一個裁縫匠說：「假如我們所做的全是男子的衣服，那末我們簡直連吃粥還不敷。我們的生活，老實說，完全靠女子的衣服；因女衣的工數較男衣省的多，可省不少絲綫；二，男衣總不至於像女衣那樣在日新月異，要是全做男衣，那麼我們起碼得餓個半死；三，而且女衣的工價較男衣的高許多，做一件旗袍，拿她四五元錢，並不算多！」上海的人，靠着女人生活的，眞不知凡幾！</p>

<p>— 程小靑著</p>
<p>第十章　皮鞋問題</p>
<p>倪金壽跟着霍桑回到停汽車的所在時，帶着失望和懷疑的神氣。立定以後，他向霍桑問括；「怎麽不問個仔細？」</p>
<p>霍桑答道：「多談沒有益處，反落痕跡。這老韓是什麽樣人！」</p>
<p>倪金壽道；「他起先在南區警署裏當過探員，現在在警備部裏辦事。這個人很有些小聰明，口才也好。他說趙伯雄已到南京去，我不大相信。」</p>
<p>霍桑尋思了一下，晚道；「但荷生旣然不在這裏，趙伯雄也許也已不在這店裏。我想你趕緊打一個電話到廳裏去，問荷生有沒有繼續的消息。如果趙伯雄眞已離開這店，要到南京去，那末我們趕到火車站去，也許還來得及。……喂，金壽兄，你得再派兩個人到這裹來，可囑他們注意每一個在這店裏出進的人。」</p>
<p>倪金壽贊同了霍桑的建議，馬上走到轉角上的一片醬園裹去借打電話。霍桑仍時時遙望那爿小烟紙店。兩三分鐘以後，他回出來時，縐着眉毛，兀自搖頭。原來不但荷生沒有報告，還有另一個探夥松泉也杳無消息。</p>
<p>霍桑躊躇了一下，說道：「那末，我們往公安醫院裏去瞧瞧李芝範究竟怎樣。」倪金壽當然沒有異議。我們就上車往那官辦的公安醫院。霍桑在汽車進行時，表示他的熱誠的希望。</p>
<p>他說道：「但願李芝範的傷勢不至於致命，至少在短時期中還能說話，那可以使我省費些精神。」</p>
<p>這句話當時原很合理，他分明希望李芝範自已能說出那個開槍打他的兇手，霍桑自然可以减少一翻偵查的精神。誰知這是一種誤解。他的話是有着雙關作用的。</p>
<p>我們到了公安醫院，對於霍桑的期望還是不卽不離。因爲據那負責的護士長說，李芝範正在割症間裏箝取子彈，不能見客。他固然還沒有死，但能不能滿足霍桑的希望，親自接談，却誰也沒有把握。倪金壽叉從醫院中打一個電話到廳裏去，再度探問荷生的消息，結果荷生的踪跡依舊像石沉大海，不過松泉已有報告到廳裹去。（一六八）</p>

<h3 id="c90">西洋木偶和東方影戲 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— 在禪</p>
<p>世界著名卡通長片「木偶奇遇記」中，有小木偶匹諾丘（Pinocch　io）被兩個壞蛋—狐狸和貓拐賣給傀儡戲班的一段事情，作者華德狄斯耐在他目述製作此片經過中也說：「木偶奇遇記是科魯第（Collodi）的傳記小說，作者眞名叫勞倫西尼（Lorenzini），他四十四歲（一八七〇）時，寫成此書，那時木人頭劇在歐洲流行已有好幾百年了。科氏此書風行全球，數達百萬，各國都有譯本，再版不知多少决，有幾個公共圖書館裏所收藏的，有三十三種之多，並有各國美術專家繪成各國圖文。」可見木偶戲在數白年前西方確是盛行的。</p>
<p>但考我國宋元（一一三九—一二八〇）時實先有這一類戲劇，像「東京夢華錄」「武林舊事」「夢粱錄」等書所載，都說宋時傀儡最盛，種類最繁，有懸絲傀儡、走線傀儡、杖傀儡、藥發傀儡、肉傀儡、水傀儡各種。「夢粱錄」又說；「凡傀儡敷衍煙粉靈怪鐵騎公案史書歷代君臣將相故事話本，或講史，或作雜劇，或作崖詞…大抵弄此多虛少實，如巨靈神朱姬大仙等也」</p>
<p>此外還有一種「影戲」，在宋時也和傀儡一同發達，「事物紀原」卷九：「宋朝仁宗時，市人有能談三國事者，或深其說加緣飾作影戲，始爲魏吳蜀三分恥爭之象。」「東京夢華錄」；「京華伎藝有影戲有喬影戲，南宋允盛。」「夢粱錄」：有弄影戲者，元汁京初以素紙雕簇，自後人巧工精，以羊皮雕形，以彩色裝飾，不至損壞……其話本與講史書者頗同，大抵眞假相牛，公忠者雕以正貌，姦邪者刻以醜形，蓋亦寓褒貶於其間耳。」</p>
<p>照以上所說，古時的木偶合影戲，雖然不過一種小玩意兒，還不是真戲劇，可是都以搬演故事爲中，一方面須要迎合觀衆心理，又在東西洋先後流行，牠們有助於戲劇的進步和成功，郤可一致公認的。不過從木偶戲演進爲新奇的卡通，從東方古老影戲演進為現代的電影，在當時怕誰都夢想不到的吧！</p>

<p>Washington - Secretary of State Hull yesterday appealed to the nation, urging them to forget the bitterness of the election and wholeheartedly support the government's foreign policy. The Secretary of State solemnly declared that the fundamental policy of the United States to aid China and England in their fight against aggression would remain unchanged. Hull stated that the entire United States unanimously supports the continued implementation of Roosevelt's foreign policy. He also said, "Our country is now able to, through the close cooperation of the government and the people, courageously advance to carry out this foreign policy." The Secretary of State also appealed to the people, requesting a "non-partisan spirit." He said, "During this dangerous summer, the arduous responsibilities weighing on our shoulders are enough to make us forget our personal dissatisfaction with the election." This message from Hull was delivered by the State Department to newspapers a few hours after Republican presidential candidate Willkie conceded Roosevelt's victory. (United Press dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<p>New York - A Washington dispatch from the New York Times states that the United States has reached a general understanding with various Latin American countries that if it is deemed necessary to defend the Western Hemisphere, U.S. troops may use the sea and air bases of those countries. New York officials say that the main purpose of the ongoing defense negotiations with various Latin American countries is that all agreed-upon sea and air bases will not be leased by the United States, but will be prepared and maintained by the countries where they are located. The United States is willing to provide technical advisors. The reason the United States does not want to lease them is because it does not want to cause sovereignty issues. The United States has notified various Latin American countries, informing them that the United States has obtained the free use of the bases leased to it by Britain. Not only Brazil, Argentina, and Chile, but bases will be set up all along the coast. It is said that U.S. negotiations with Cuba and the Dominican Republic are practically complete. (Reuters dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese newspapers today unanimously predict that Roosevelt's re-election is a sign of "the United States adopting a more aggressive policy towards Japan." The Yomiuri Shimbun states that President Roosevelt's third consecutive term has closed the door to adjusting U.S.-Japan relations, and Japan should make new decisions to cope with the development of the situation. The Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun once again warned the United States, saying that "Japan has decided to terminate all U.S. aid to the Chongqing National Government, regardless of what actions the United States under Roosevelt takes." The newspaper predicts that the United States will intensify its aid to Britain. The newspaper also said, "President Roosevelt may, like President Wilson before him, once elected again on a non-war slogan, drag the country into war." The Kokumin Shimbun claims that the "war party" has won the U.S. election. The newspaper also said that Japan and the Axis powers should immediately prepare for the worst. Foolish peacelovers should have a clear understanding of reality. Up until now, Japan has taken a non-resistant approach to U.S. challenges, but henceforth, this policy "can no longer be continued." The Asahi Shimbun, which advocates harmony, states that Japan needs to make a decision, as a more hardline U.S. Far East foreign policy is foreseeable. The newspaper believes that only if the United States can change its attitude towards the Far East can misunderstandings between the two countries be eliminated.

<p>Tokyo - An editorial in the Nichi Nichi Shimbun today predicts that with Roosevelt's re-election as president, the United States will continue to aid Chongqing, along with its aid to Britain. It is claimed that it must be emphatically stated that Japan is fully prepared to overcome any assistance the United States gives to Chongqing. Roosevelt's victory in the third presidential election is similar to Wilson's second election in 1916. The Roosevelt government, having expressed excessive enthusiasm for helping Britain, will eventually betray the American people and drag the United States into a vortex. Roosevelt's election this time is due to the serious domestic and international situation currently facing the United States. However, this serious period was caused by the United States and Roosevelt. The American people do not know for sure who is to blame for the current situation, and therefore entrust the fate of the United States to Roosevelt's "talent and experience," which is a strange phenomenon. If the American people were to review Roosevelt's achievements, it would be doubtful whether they would still trust his "talent and experience," as Roosevelt's administration has increased the public debt by 2.5 trillion yuan, failed to solve the problem of 9.6 million unemployed people at home, and caused unnecessary friction abroad.

<h3 id="e2">Thirty-Nine U.S. States Support Roosevelt; Formal Election Next Month <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Washington - As the results of yesterday's nationwide voting were revealed, the number of votes electing President Roosevelt continued to increase, eventually overwhelming Willkie. Thirty-nine states support Roosevelt, with a total of 468 electoral votes. Only nine states support Willkie, with a total of 63 electoral votes. The popular vote was held at 3:30 PM yesterday (4:30 AM on the 7th Shanghai time). Roosevelt received 23,070,085 votes, while Willkie received 19,337,421 votes. Although Willkie failed, his vote count far exceeded that of the Republican presidential candidate Landon, who failed in the 1936 election, as Landon's popular vote at that time was only 1,659,828 votes. The states led by Roosevelt are Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana ,Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia, thirty states in total. The electoral votes of these thirty states total 415, far exceeding the number sufficient to guarantee Roosevelt's re-election. In addition, President Roosevelt also won the support of nine states: Idaho, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The total electoral votes of these nine states are 53, which, combined with the 415 votes of the previous thirty states, totals 468 votes. Those won by Willkie include Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Nebraska, South Dakota and six states in Wilburham, the total electoral votes for the above six states are 39 votes, and three states in Colorado, Indiana and North Dakota, the above three states have 24 votes, a total of 63 votes.

<p>Chongqing - The United States held a general election yesterday. More than 50 million voters across the country voted in their respective constituencies. What they elected were electoral representatives, who then voted to elect the president and vice president. According to the U.S. electoral system, each state should elect a number of electoral representatives, the number of which is the same as the total number of senators and representatives in that state, but senators and representatives may not. After the general election is held, all electoral representatives will be generated and will vote in the state capitals next month to elect the president and vice president. After the vote, it will be sealed and sent to Washington, D.C., where the Speaker of the Senate will open the ballots in front of senators and representatives. After counting the votes, the presidential and vice presidential candidates with the most votes will be elected. In theory, electoral representatives are not limited to electing candidates from the Democratic or Republican parties, but because electoral representatives from each state are fundamentally selected by each party, they must follow the orders of their party and elect their party's presidential candidate. Therefore, in the formal election next month, electoral representatives in each state where the Democratic Party has a majority will naturally elect Roosevelt and Wallace. The term of office of the current president and vice president will end at noon on January 20 next year. Roosevelt and Gardner will take office, and then Roosevelt and Wallace will be sworn in by Chief Justice Hughes of the Supreme Court, officially taking office as the 34th President and Vice President of the United States.

<p>Manila - Philippine President Quezon expressed satisfaction here last night. He said, "I have always believed that the President's re-election is inevitable. President Roosevelt has won the trust of the American people. The combined forces of conservatives and extremists have been unable to do anything. We are deeply pleased with Roosevelt's re-election because we trust his policies. He has always been a friend of ours. Now that I know that President Roosevelt will be in the White House for another four-year term, I cannot help but feel a great increase in confidence for the future." At the same time, U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, also expressed satisfaction with Roosevelt's re-election. He said, "Today, the country's words and actions will be more resolute. The Americas, in thought and action, have united as one to do what should be done, and there is no longer any hesitation. We are currently at the most serious period in history. In order to defend the great principles of democracy and human freedom, the Americas will not recognize any differences of opinion between political parties. Our attention is focused on the future. We will move forward under the leadership of our great President, with confidence and without fear." (United Press dispatch of the 7th)</p>

<p>New York - Smith, the Democratic candidate for president who failed in 1928, although supporting Republican presidential candidate Gorky in the 1940 election, yesterday firmly supported Roosevelt.

Therefore, the American people should unanimously support Roosevelt for the sake of the future welfare of the country." (United Press dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Willkie Concedes Defeat; Accepts Election Results; Continues to Work for American Unity; Roosevelt Will Give Him an Important Position <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>New York - After finally conceding defeat, Willkie issued a moving statement, saying, "I accept the election results in complete good faith. The American election represents the vividness of our principles of popular rule. I know that my Republican comrades will continue to work as I do to seek the unity of our people, to complete our defense, to continue aid to England, and to eliminate hatred within the United States, so that the government of free people may continue to exist." The re-election of the unprecedented third-term president not only has a surprising victory, with a majority of Congress as its backing, but also has the support of the Republican Party, which failed in this election, in dealing with the most difficult period in American history. According to what was known at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, the Democratic Party won 239 seats in the House of Representatives, and the Republican Party won 121 seats. It is estimated that the Democratic Party has 9 more seats than before. As for the Senate, the Democratic Party won 50 seats, and the Republican Party won 9 seats. It is estimated that the Republican Party has two more seats than before. President Roosevelt accepted Willkie's congratulatory telegram last night with sincere thanks. His reply telegram said, "I am very pleased to receive your wishes for health and happiness. I extend the same wishes to you." Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was re-elected as a senator in Nevada with a majority of about 6,000 votes. General commentaries all say that although the president's third term in office broke the valuable traditional proposition, making many Americans unhappy, all parties are willing to forget the excitement of the election competition and unanimously support the president. A New York dispatch says that Willkie's work for the United States can never be forgotten. It also says that national defense must be done quickly, and aid to England must be intensified. In recent weeks, there has been some speculation that if the Democratic Party wins, President Roosevelt may give a seat in the cabinet, such as the important position of managing the production of national defense supplies, to ... Erki. Lewis, leader of the American Industrial Organizations Congress, is one of the most failed in the election. Lullers has issued a statement to American workers that voting for Labor Roosevelt is equivalent to a vote of no confidence in him. Now, if Lullers resigns from the chairmanship of the American Industrial Organizations Congress, the two labor groups, the American Federation of Labor and the Industrial Organizations Congress, can be merged. Green, President of the American Federation of Labor, telegraphed President Roosevelt this afternoon to guarantee the association's cooperation in implementing procedures to promote national unity and maintain peaceful national defense. According to a report from New York at 4:30 p.m. (4:30 a.m. Shanghai time today), Roosevelt's majority of popular votes has exceeded 4 million votes. According to a report from New York at 4:45 p.m., the Democratic Party occupies 254 seats in the House of Representatives, and the Republican Party occupies 110 seats. The election results of the provincial governors show that the Democratic Party has won 16 people and the Republican Party has 10 people. (Reuters dispatch of the 7th)</p>

<p>Hyde Park - President Roosevelt pointed out yesterday that unifying labor organizations may be the first item of his third consecutive term. It is believed that the President's purpose will be to unite the American Federation of Labor and the Industrial Organizations Congress, and Louis, Chairman of the Industrial Organizations Congress, may resign. The President attended the groundbreaking ceremony of the post office in the area yesterday. Among the crowd, several workers raised banners with the words "Labor can prosper after Louis resigns" and "Not for Louis, but for labor unity." When the President saw this, he told reporters that what they were asking for may be more useful than his activities here at noon. (United Press dispatch of the 7th)</p>

<h3 id="e6">The Meaning of Roosevelt's Victory <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>"A victory for public opinion and common sense!" This is the feeling expressed in yesterday's editorial in this newspaper. The London Star called it "a victory for democracy." In this period when the international order is shaken and about to collapse, and bleak darkness and hideous flames are growing and spreading, almost shrouding the entire world, Roosevelt, with his policies and achievements, has won the support of the vast majority of the people, breaking the historical precedent of U.S. presidents serving only two consecutive terms, and being elected to serve three terms as the master of the White House, continuing his political power for eight or even twelve years. All those who can distinguish right from wrong, cherish justice, and value civilization must have an impression of Roosevelt's victory that is deeply believed to be similar to that of this newspaper and the Star.</p>
<p>Roosevelt belongs to the Democratic Party, and Willkie, who failed in the election, belongs to the Republican Party. One wins and one loses. It is not just between the two parties and two people, but there is a distinction between black and white, good and evil, and civilization and barbarism. The two parties and two people declared their ambitions and expounded their policies during the election. It can be said that there is not much difference. The current major plans are all based on responding to the international situation and seeking internal and external affairs. The principles stated by the two parties and two people are the same, and their specific actions to support China and Britain are also the same. The final result of one win and one loss can at least strongly and thoroughly prove the following two important points: (1) The international policy of the Democratic Party is absolutely bright, great, and accurate. Therefore, although the Republican Party opposes and confronts it, the policies it promotes absolutely cannot surpass or revise the scope of the Democratic Party's policies, let alone create new ideas and run counter to the Democratic Party's policies. From this, it is even more imaginable that if the Republican Party had proposed opposing the original policy in order to compete in the election, it would have received far fewer votes, and the failure would have been even more miserable. (2) Roosevelt has been in power for eight years, boldly and resolutely. Considering the general phenomenon that there is no absolute in political gains and losses, and that there is always a disadvantage for every advantage, there is of course plenty of room for praise, criticism, and slander. The other party can add opposition and attacks, not only is there no excuse for small troubles, but they can also do so with good reason. However, the fact that the other party traveled more than 30,000 miles and still received the support of the majority shows that achievements have grasped social beliefs, and virtue and sincerity have captured the hearts of the people. This is the basic source of a politician's political life. With this, governing the country and leading the people can be as easy as lifting a weight, and with this, promoting policies will be like the wind blowing over the grass. This is not accidental. It is also absolutely small, like the Eastern concept that having great power in hand, being deeply rooted, and having some kind of administrative and financial power to borrow as a means of winning the election. Not only that, but he also has two ruthless weaknesses: One is the policy of supporting China and Britain, which has a strong suspicion of preparing to participate in the war. Therefore, those who attacked him even incited the women's world, which has a huge number of votes, saying that virtuous wives and good mothers who want to prevent their husbands and sons from desperately fighting in the war should oppose Roosevelt, who is preparing to participate in the war. What a sharp and shocking cold arrow this is! Second, the founding father of the United States, Washington, can be said to have great achievements and be loved by all, but he declined the third election and retired in order to avoid being the head of the whole life and to preserve the spirit of the republic. Therefore, the fact that U.S. presidents only serve two terms is not just a mechanical and historical precedent, but also the highest moral standard with serious significance and related to political principles. Only this point is something that none of the former wise presidents before Roosevelt were willing to break, nor could they break. Not only that, but Roosevelt's New Deal in the past eight years, and the temporary dominance of totalitarian political systems, have long made Roosevelt suspected of attempting to be a dictator. Such a solemn historical creed, such bad signs and environment, for Roosevelt, who has already served two terms, are simply an inexplicable and irresistible "deadline" has arrived, and the only way is to let go. Roosevelt has now overcome these two ruthless weaknesses. This is Roosevelt's miracle and also America's miracle. It is by no means accidental. However, this is also precisely why the international situation is reflected in the bleak darkness and hideous flames, and the degree of danger has reached such a degree that at least the American people feel that what they are encountering now and what they have to deal with in the future is unprecedented in history!</p>
<p>In terms of political strategy, the key to Roosevelt's victory lies not in the present but in the past. The present is only expressed by the national vote. He invited the Republican Stimson and Knox to share national affairs and take charge of the army and navy. Originally, inviting the heroes of the opposing party to work together is a matter of great justice, self-confidence, and great wisdom and courage. It is also an unprecedented move in the United States, but it is still difficult to call it a miracle. However, the fact that the two men gladly accepted the appointment is not because they are pursuing high positions and wealth and betraying the party, but because there is mutual trust between them, and there is a mission that transcends their party. When the two men took office, it could be said that Roosevelt had already won. What Roosevelt won was not just continuing to be the master of the White House. Yesterday's Washington dispatch: In the United States, the labor camp has always been divided into two factions, and the American Federation of Labor and the Industrial Organizations Congress, which are almost like enemy countries, will merge into one due to Roosevelt's success. This is a major event with extremely profound significance. This is one. Roosevelt intends to recruit Willkie, who failed in the election, to jointly plan national defense, or even appoint him as Chairman of the National Defense Committee. Whether it will be realized or not is unknown to us, but in the attitude of the winning party in the opposition between the two parties, everyone can confirm that its nature is by no means just a matter of official position, but has other functions. This is one. Willkie failed. In fact, there must be a failure in every election. It is also possible for the loser to "do nothing." However, Willkie has a sincere and frank statement, saying, "The American election shows the vividness of our principles of popular rule. I know that my Republican comrades will continue to work as I do to seek national unity and complete national defense." He also said that he must "continue to aid China and England and eliminate hatred within the United States." This is a precious promise that any party in power cannot ask for from the opposing party. Now, the Republican Party has made this promise spontaneously, and the Democratic Party has obtained it without asking, indicating that the future international policy of the United States has the backing of the entire nation. This is three. These three are the unprecedented victories that Roosevelt has shown in addition to his election victory!</p>

<p>Chongqing – Chinese and Japanese troops are currently engaged in combat outside Qin County. Japanese troops retreating from Nanning are reportedly embarking on ships there. It is said that a unit of the Chinese army had already attacked and entered Qin County on the night of November 4th and is now engaged in street battles with Japanese troops. Yesterday, a strong unit of the Chinese army arrived at a location south of Qin County, threatening the retreat of the Japanese troops currently trapped in Qin County. Zhennanguan on the Vietnamese border was captured by the Chinese army yesterday. The Japanese army is urgently dispatching reinforcements from Lang Son to the border. Fierce fighting is reportedly underway. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Nanning – The Chinese army’s advance on Qin County is proving very successful. The Chinese are fiercely besieging the high ground around Qingshuiwo and Wanghuoao, strongholds on the periphery, trapping the Japanese. (Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Zigui – Japanese troops harassing Guanchang northeast of Guanmiaochang, Wangjiatai, and Ma’anshan have been repeatedly and fiercely attacked by the Chinese army, resulting in their defeat. Mopping-up operations against the remaining Japanese forces are currently underway. (Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – According to the opinions of general observers, at a time when Japan is withdrawing large numbers of troops from China to supply other theaters of operations, there is further evidence indicating that Japan is currently withdrawing its aircraft from China. One part is intended to augment Japan's air force in potential battles in the South China Sea. Another part, otherwise, is intended to strengthen Japan's domestic defenses. It is widely rumored that the Japanese are withdrawing troops from Guangxi Province, Vietnam, and the Shanghai-Nanjing area. As a result, the Chinese army has recaptured Nanning, Longzhou, and Zhennanguan, and is attacking Qin County. The Chinese army along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and highway is also very active. The Chinese army in the Yangtze River basin has already recaptured Madang, downstream from Jiujiang. It is also rumored that Chinese artillery has bombarded the city of Yichang and its airfield, encountering little resistance from the Japanese side. According to well-informed foreign observers, more Japanese troops may withdraw from China in the coming days. Local Chinese personnel have received reliable information stating that the Japanese army has withdrawn half of its air force in Hankou. At the beginning of summer, the Japanese concentrated 400 aircraft in Hankou for attacks on Chongqing, including the most elite 13th and 15th squadrons. However, today there are only 200 aircraft remaining in Hankou, including 30 heavy bombers, with the remainder being light bombers, reconnaissance aircraft, and fighters. It is heard that the majority of the 200 aircraft withdrawn by the Japanese have been transferred back to the Japanese mainland, apparently because American Flying Fortresses based in Alaska are quite capable of launching air raids. From this, one can see a glimpse of Japan's anxiety regarding possible reactions from the American side in the event of an occupation of the Dutch East Indies. Local people here also attach great importance to the announcement made by the Japanese today regarding the conclusion of military operations in the Yichang area. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>

The spokesperson immediately and strongly denied this, stating that the rumors were completely baseless. Furthermore, responsible individuals declared that rumors circulating that Germany was planning to mediate the Sino-Japanese war were purely speculative and not factual. Since 1937, when Nanjing had not yet fallen, German Ambassador Trautmann had once explored the Chinese side's opinion on the matter, but after the result had failed, the German side had never raised it again. Moreover, since Germany knew that it was practically impossible to formulate mutually acceptable peace terms, it would no longer attempt to mediate. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>Nanning – Today, the reporter visited Chairman Huang Xuchu and inquired about the various post-war matters in Nanning.

Those in the countryside will also be provided with loans to support their livelihoods and resume their cultivation. (3) The city's public works, such as the power plant and the water plant, have not been extensively damaged, except for the water plant's pump, which was sunk into the river by the Japanese. They can be fully restored in a short period of time. (4) Regarding public health, cleaning and sweeping have begun, and the provincial hospital will soon re-establish its operations.

<p>From Liuzhou to Nanning</p>
<p>Nanning Central News Agency reporter Liu Xingzhou telegraphed: We left the Liujiang River and headed towards the place where this significant historical event occurred. Normally, the distance from Liuzhou to Nanning is 190 kilometers, and it takes only a day by car. However, we took four days and two nights, because the car could only travel to a small town a few kilometers south of Binyang. After that, the rest of the journey relied entirely on our two feet. We spent the long nights in the car's bumpy ride, and arrived at the end of the road on the first dawn of November. Excitement drove away fatigue, and we immediately proceeded on foot. We arrived at Silong, the last township under Binyang County, at noon.</p>
<p>Before the recapture of Nanning, Silong was the first forward supply station on the Yongbin and Yongwu routes. In order to meet military needs, the Binyang County government set up an office here. The war zone authorities and the Guangxi Pacification Headquarters also jointly established a bridge of military-civilian cooperation. The military-civilian cooperation station was busy all day long with tasks such as conscription, medical care, road repair, bridge construction, and procurement of food supplies. Not only did the troops benefit, but also other passersby related to the military received a lot of help from them. Our food and lodging here were solved with their help.</p>
<p>Why did the Japanese abandon Nanning? No one here would ask such a question. They unanimously firmly believed that the Japanese had long been driven into a dead end in military, economic, and natural environment aspects. The withered wood placed on the dangerous cliff could not withstand the storm, and the foundationless buildings would inevitably be pushed down by the crowd. They knew this principle even more clearly than we did.</p>
<p>It has been three days since Nanning was recaptured, and there has been no activity of Japanese aircraft. However, when we had just arrived at Kunlun Pass, we discovered a Japanese plane flying extremely low, passing overhead. Immediately afterwards, we heard four explosions, bursting not far behind us. It was later learned that Silong had been bombed, and one of our travel companions suffered minor leg injuries because he stayed in Silong to hire laborers.</p>
<p>Kunlun Pass is a familiar place to the reporter, but even though the scenery is different from when we fought in the spring, a cemetery for fallen soldiers has now been built on the mountain.</p>
<p>Along the road from Kunlun Pass to Qitang, countless barbed wire fences and other obstacles were left behind. The highway was also particularly badly damaged, with almost no complete bridges. Although the road between Qitang and Wutang was still relatively intact, the bridges were also destroyed. The villages and houses on both sides of the highway have been completely bombed by Japanese aircraft. Because the villages and houses were completely gone, it was difficult to see people along the way, so our food and lodging became a problem. It took us a full nineteen hours to walk from Silong to Wutang. From the first breakfast to the second breakfast, there was a distance of twenty-six hours in between. Apart from that, we did not eat anything. The sleep in between was only two hours, on the grass on the bank of a river at night.</p>
<p>On the morning of the fourth day after leaving Liuzhou, we passed Qitang and Wutang. Although it was only an hour's journey to enter Sitang, the situation in these two places was completely different. Originally, Sitang was the first forward stronghold of the Japanese army on the Yongbin Road. Everything that entered our senses there was tainted with a foreign color. Wine bottles, canned goods, boxes, and broken military supplies were littered everywhere. Particularly eye-catching was the cremation pit behind the village, surrounded by a lot of firewood. The fortifications on the small hills in front of the village were not damaged at all. Each fortification consisted of a fortress capable of accommodating a squad of soldiers and two rows of barbed wire. Empty cans were hung on the wire, which they used as warning bells to prevent sneak attacks. On the gap near the barbed wire, our engineers wrote a warning: "Beware of Landmines," which made everyone nervous. Afterwards, every bridge or piece of muddy ground had the same warning written on it. This was not a joke. In fact, it is not known how many landmines were buried by the Japanese along the way. When we had crossed about three kilometers from Sitang, we heard the sound of a landmine exploding, drifting from the direction of Sitang. Everyone looked back at the same time, and then stared at each other with strange eyes, before continuing to move forward. At this time, everyone was worried about the fate of those who passed through Sitang later.</p>
<p>The highway, bridges, and telephone poles from Qitang to Nanning were completely undamaged, with only two telephone poles printed with a few slogans, but they were not cut off, indicating that the Japanese did not retreat very calmly. At the same time, we discovered that the rain-soaked highway was printed with messy hobnail prints and dozens of uncoordinated car prints, which was enough to indicate that the Japanese retreat was quite hasty.</p>
<p>In Sitang, to General Kou Koukou, he and his senior staff were studying the things left behind by the Japanese. In Santang, we met Chairman Huang Xuchu. They left Liuzhou one day later than us, but due to the full use of transportation conditions, they shortened the journey by one day, and finally entered Nanning on the same day as us.</p>
<p>In the suburbs of Nanning, the first large building that caught our eye was the Guangxi Provincial Animal Husbandry Protection Institute and the Nanning Bus Station. The former was still complete, while the latter was severely damaged. Turning past the bus station, we saw the majestic city of Nanning. The national flag was flying high on the city wall, symbolizing the revival of the nation and the rebirth of Nanning. Normally, we see the national flag too often, so it does not always give people a new feeling. But at this time and in this place, the national flag evoked a powerful and indescribable excitement in people's hearts. We entered the north gate of Nanning with orderly steps and a joyful heart. The first slogan we saw at the city gate was "Compatriots of Nanning, please come back and rebuild your homes." (Dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>Athens – According to reliable statistics, the Italian army's dead, wounded, and captured in the past week have reached 30,000. The Greek High Command announced yesterday that the Greek army has occupied new mountain positions of the Italian army in Albania, and intends to intensify the encirclement of the large Italian army units trapped near Lake Mikri Prespa. The Greek authorities' claimed number of deaths and injuries in the past week is based on news arriving here after the fierce battles in the mountain passes between Greece and Albania, and is based on statistics.

<p>Athens - Yesterday, British and Greek air forces collaborated again, repeatedly attacking various seaports in southern Italy and Albania. British and Greek aircraft flew low and bombed the recently improved port of Vlorë on the border, an important base for Italian troops coping with the Epirus front. The port facilities were fiercely bombed. According to the Greek High Command, Italian and Greek troops exchanged artillery fire in the northern area of ​​the entire front. On the far left flank near the sea, Greek troops retreated slightly. An Italian airman shot down in a recent dogfight over Thessaloniki was captured and has arrived here. The captured Italian airman expressed surprise and admiration for the heroic resistance of Greece. The Italian airman said, "We always thought that the Greek air force was very small, but now we are surprised to find it so strong. Our superiors had previously told us that Greece would not be able to defend itself, and even in the last minute they said that Greece would not dare to fight." When reporters asked why Italian planes bombed civilians, the Italian airman replied that because the anti-aircraft fire was too fierce, they did not have enough time to carefully distinguish targets, so they had to act hastily. It is reported that three Italian planes were shot down over Thessaloniki. When the air raid alarm sounded in Athens today, the Italian airman was also ordered to take refuge in an air-raid shelter. The Greek High Command also stated that all Greek planes that went to bomb Italian troops and scout Albanian territory yesterday returned safely. It also stated that when Greek troops occupied a new line of defense in the mountains west of Macedonia on Tuesday, Italian troops abandoned four cannons, nine mountain guns, and thirty-two machine guns. (United Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Rome - According to an announcement by the Italian military headquarters, Italian troops have crossed the Kalamas River. Italian aircraft assisted in the attack, strafing British positions and bombing military targets in the port of Patras, Larissa station, and Missolonghi. Fires broke out in various places after the bombings. All Italian aircraft returned to their bases. One British plane was shot down, and another large one was also shot down. When British planes attacked Vlorë, one was shot down by Italian fighter planes, and another was shot down by naval anti-aircraft guns. Italian fighter planes destroyed one enemy plane near Malta. On the East African front, British attacks near Gallabat have been repelled and suffered heavy casualties, but the British continue to attack and are currently engaged in fierce fighting. Italian aircraft have shot down six enemy planes on that front. (Haitong Telegraph, 7th)</p>
<p>Rome - Italian official radio announced that Italian and Greek forces engaged in fierce fighting yesterday. Italian cavalry, infantry, and mechanized troops all made progress and captured many Greek soldiers. The radio station also formally admitted that Italian planes had bombed the town of Monastir in southern Greece (i.e., Bitola), claiming it was bombed by British planes. (United Press International, 7th)</p>
<p>Athens - Last night, residents of Athens took refuge in air-raid shelters twice due to air raid alarms. However, no bombs fell on Athens. However, the cities near Corinth, Larissa, Lalas, and Patras were attacked by Italian planes, resulting in some casualties. (International Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Thessaloniki - Thessaloniki has been bombed for three consecutive days, but no military targets have been hit. The Italian side's aerial combat skills are poor, and their aim is inaccurate. The four captured Italian pilots are all employees of the Italian airline company who usually travel between Brindisi, Thessaloniki, and Athens. One of the planes they were in was forced to land in Greek territory during the air raid on Thessaloniki on Saturday. One of them said that forty Italian planes departed from Brindisi but could not reach their destination. The pilots were temporarily and hastily enlisted, so they did not know each other. People here believe that many Italian pilots are unwilling to fly to Greece to bomb, so the authorities have to find ways to fabricate so-called "forced landings." This theory is quite credible, as there have recently been incidents of Italian bombers landing intact and the crew surrendering. Although many soldiers and civilians in Thessaloniki have died in the air raids, morale is very good. The governor of Thessaloniki gladly told reporters that the news from the front is getting better every day, and the Italian soldiers are just coming to be beaten. The local anti-aircraft artillery shot at ten enemy planes, shooting down three, which greatly pleased the people. Although Italian residents here have been detained, German residents are still free to leave and are eager to transport goods out of the country, but they have not been able to do so because the railway to Yugoslavia is now exclusively for military use. A batch of tobacco worth £5 million was intended to be shipped to Germany based on a barter agreement when the Greek-Italian war broke out, but it has also been unable to be shipped.

<p>Istanbul - People here now believe that Germany will have to pass through Yugoslavia to aid Italy in its war against Greece, as the slow progress of the Italian troops has shaken the prestige of the Axis powers. It is generally believed that Germany will not allow Italy to wage a protracted winter war against Greece, but without assistance, Italy may not be able to win in the winter war. Therefore, there is a move to send troops to aid Italy, and the reason for passing through Yugoslavia is probably to avoid sending troops through Bulgaria, which would be opposed by Turkey.

<p>London - The government announced that in response to Greece's request for economic aid, the British government has assured them that it is prepared to provide the necessary economic assistance within the sterling area. The British government will therefore immediately allocate £5 million as an advance payment to the Greek government for its disposal. It is heard that this first payment is not necessarily fixed at £5 million and will be increased as appropriate depending on the situation. It is reported that Britain is currently making every effort to provide Greece with economic assistance. For example, British commercial companies are transporting large quantities of wheat, corn, coal, rubber, and tin stored in various ports to Greece, intending to conduct general trade with the Balkan countries and preparing to immediately purchase large quantities of Greek dried fruits and other products. It is heard that the Greek-Italian war has made this kind of purchase and transfer convenient, and the issue of price is now a secondary factor. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

German planes were also detected in southwestern England and southern Wales last night at 9:30 PM. At 7:30 PM, German planes approached Liverpool, where the British King and Queen happened to be that day. In the London area, anti-aircraft guns began to fire loudly at 6:30 AM, but soon stopped.

<p>Moscow - Last night, the Moscow Soviet of Workers' Deputies and representatives of various trade unions and public organizations held a solemn gathering at the Grand Theatre to celebrate the 23rd anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution. Attendees included members of the Supreme Soviet, senior officers of the Red Army and Navy, Soviet heroes, scientists, cultural figures, the diplomatic corps, and foreign journalists. The venue was excellently decorated and full of slogans. One slogan read, "Long live the Soviet government's policy of peace and safeguarding the security of the motherland." When Stalin, Molotov, Voroshilov, Kalinin, and others took their seats on the presidium, the entire venue stood up and cheered. First, Pruning, Chairman of the Moscow Soviet Executive Committee, announced the opening of the meeting. Amid cheers, Stalin, Molotov, Voroshilov, Kalinin, Andreyev, Mikoyan, Chutov, Gurzhov, Beria, Chefnik, and Dimitrov were elected honorary presidium of the conference. Then, Kalinin, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, delivered a speech lasting forty minutes, which was greeted with thunderous applause. The conference also passed a declaration congratulating Stalin and Molotov. (TASS, 7th)</p>
<p>Kalinin's Speech</p>
<p>Moscow - On November 6, Kalinin, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, delivered a speech at a gathering of the Moscow Soviet and popular organizations, stating, "The 23rd year since the establishment of the Soviet government will be a year of important diplomatic and socialist construction achievements in Soviet history. According to reliable statistics, industrial output in 1940 will increase by 13,600,000 rubles, an increase of 11% compared to 1939. This figure does not include Western Ukraine, Belarus, and other new Soviet republics. Metal and coal production are increasing. For example, compared to the same month last year, coal production increased by 112% in July, 114.3% in August, and 116% in September. As for ordinary heavy industry, it has increased its output in the second half of this year. The work performance of light industry is also very satisfactory. The railways have completed their urgent tasks. Although the weather this year has been harsh, the agricultural harvest has been very good. The grain harvest reached 700 million poods. Food has become a serious problem for Western European countries involved in the war. In addition, the agricultural harvest in countries that have not joined the war is not very good."</p>
<p>Taking Steps to Develop Industry</p>
<p>At this point, Kalinin then described the various steps taken by the Soviet government this year to develop industry, such as the implementation of the eight-hour workday and the seven-day workweek system, the strict prohibition of desertion, and the mobilization of reserve labor forces. When mentioning foreign policy, Kalinin said, "The Soviet Union's decision to fight against Finland took a lot of effort. The weather and geography were not conducive to the Soviet army. Forests, frost, snow, and temperatures below zero degrees made it impossible for the Red Army to develop their skills. However, the Soviet army has shown the world that no obstacle can stop them from advancing. After three months of fighting, Finland was forced to make peace, the terms of which were proposed by the Soviet side. The corrupt petty-bourgeois newspapers initially attempted to undermine the reputation of the Red Army, but in the end, they had to admit in their newspapers that they had spread false information in an attempt to undermine the reputation of the Red Army. I firmly believe that our military authorities will publish the truth in the newspapers. Four hundred and five participants in the Soviet-Finnish war have been awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, and countless others have received commendations. Even these figures alone can prove the heroic achievements of the Red Army. There is good reason why the Soviet people love the Red Army.</p>
<p>Increase in Population of Over 20 Million</p>
<p>Since Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia were merged into the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's land and population have greatly increased. The incorporation of these three countries into the Soviet Union is extremely important. I have never seen such a thing in history. The capitalist class ruled these three countries for twenty years, and they were constantly inciting the people to hate the Soviet Union, but they still failed to prevent the people from sympathizing with the Soviet Union. The old governments of these three countries could not actually gain the support of the people. They were forced to hand over power to the People's Government in order to comply with the wishes of the people. The People's Government requested to join the Soviet Union. As a result, these three countries have now become equal Soviet republics. This is proof of the people of these three countries' love for the Soviet Union. An important historical mistake has been corrected this year. Bessarabia has been reunited with the Soviet Union. We should not forget the lack of good faith of the Romanian capitalists. In the last World War, Russia was Romania's ally, and the Russian army helped Romania resist Germany, but the Romanian capitalists took advantage of our country's military weakness when the revolution had just succeeded and forcibly seized a part of our territory. Currently, we have conquered Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. As for the enthusiasm of the people in those two regions for joining the Soviet Union, it is unnecessary to elaborate. They will surely feel it when our Red Army arrives. From this point of view, 23 million people have joined the Soviet Union this year. They have obtained all the rights of Soviet citizens (first and foremost the glorious task of serving in the Red Army). Currently, the armies of Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia have been merged into the Red Army. This point has proven that the unity of the Soviet nation is stronger than anything seen in history.</p>
<p>Cannot Stay Out of the War</p>
<p>Currently, almost the entire world is engulfed in war. Among the great powers, only the Soviet Union has stayed out of the war and maintained strict neutrality. Such a fierce war cannot but have an impact on neutral countries, but it is a great blessing to be able to avoid being drawn into the war. Although this good fortune is by no means accidental, it is due to our country's achievements and the success of our foreign policy. At the same time, it is also the result of the efforts of our leader, Comrade Stalin, who guides our country's economy, diplomacy, and military affairs. The current international situation has made it impossible for us to continue to stand in an impartial, unbiased, and detached position to observe all developments. This situation has given every Soviet citizen an important task. The Soviet Union is the only socialist country in the world, and the working masses have now gained a true motherland. This fact is unprecedented in history. Our most important task at present is to consolidate the economy and national defense strength of our socialist motherland. Workers, writers, artists, and all Soviet citizens must do their utmost to further consolidate the national strength of the socialist state. This is also the meaning of the Soviet people's completion of their mission to the world proletariat. In this struggle for communism, we are led by the Communist Party and Comrade Stalin. On the occasion of this great anniversary of the October Revolution, we would like to extend our highest enthusiasm to our leader, the great Stalin. (TASS, 7th)</p>
<p>Message from the Minister of Defense</p>
<p>Moscow - On the 23rd anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution, Marshal Timoshenko, People's Commissar of Defense of the Soviet Union, issued a message stating, "We are celebrating the anniversary of the 13th Revolution, at a time when the international situation is extremely serious. The second imperialist war to compete for world hegemony is expanding, and new regions and new nations are being affected. The wise diplomatic policy of Stalin and the Soviet government (that is, the policy of peace and safeguarding the security of the motherland) has achieved glorious victories. The position occupied by the Soviet Union in resolving international issues has become more important, and the prestige of the Soviet Union has also increased in the eyes of working people around the world. The Soviet government, relying on the strength of the Red Army (has used peaceful methods to resolve the Soviet-Romanian disputes regarding Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. In the three countries of Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia, the forces of landlords and capitalists, who were hated by the people, have been overthrown. At the same time, in the small capitalist countries that hate socialism, a new and happy life has been built, benefiting the people who follow socialist construction. In order to enhance its border security and national interests, the Soviet Union has shifted its border westward. The Soviet Union has now obtained strong bases in the Gulf of Finland, the Baltic Sea, and the Danube River. The capitalist world has been forced to make concessions. Although we have achieved great achievements, we cannot be complacent. In the serious international situation, our Red Army must be doubly vigilant. Stalin once said, we must always keep the entire nation in a state of mobilization and be ready to deal with foreign attacks at any time, so that the enemy's various "unexpected events" and cunning schemes cannot be implemented. We must keep this instruction in mind. We must strengthen the Red Army and Navy, and further enhance our country's national defense and economic strength. Our Red Army is the guarantee of the Soviet people's peaceful work and the achievements of the October Revolution, and is now rapidly developing its strength. Under the orders of the government and the Party, the Red Army will surely crush all enemies who dare to invade the sacred borders of the socialist country. (TASS, 7th)</p>

<p>New York – According to a report from the British Broadcasting Corporation received by this local National Broadcasting Company, Spain yesterday summoned five classes of reserve soldiers. Within three days, Spain has taken its second step towards assisting the Axis powers and joining the European war. Local observers say that the first step was the occupation of the international zone of Tangier, a neutral port on the entire North African coast of the Mediterranean Sea, directly opposite Gibraltar, and in a strategically important location. Spain's sudden occupation of this area indicates that Franco has decided to join the war against Britain. The Spanish troops occupying Tangier are commanded by Colonel Yushide. After artillery units passed through the international zone and stationed at several key points, the Spanish army issued a proclamation stating that Tangier has returned to Spanish territory. The envoys of the powers related to this international zone have all received notification that the international status there has ended. (International News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>The newly elected Vice President of the United States, Henry Wallace, is a devoutly religious man and a well-read student of the Bible. During his seven years as Secretary of Agriculture, his staff knew that he would quote scripture even on matters that seemed completely unrelated.</p>
<p>Wallace's religious faith originally belonged to the Presbyterian Church, but nine years ago he switched to the Methodist Church. He accepted the position of leader of a Bible class and became an assistant to the pastor. For several months, every Sunday he would wear a robe and kneel before the altar in prayer. After he went to Washington as Secretary of Agriculture in 1933, he continued to attend services as usual, but he had one unique characteristic: he preferred to walk past the magnificent churches in the White House area and choose a quiet church in the southeast.</p>
<p>Although Wallace's personality has a mystical quality, he is exceptionally intelligent and proficient in science. Five years after leaving Iowa State Agricultural College, he drafted the first ratio table predicting the market for maize and pigs, and his reputation rose accordingly. In the field of eugenics, he experimented with maize cultivation methods and improved planting, so long before he had any hope of entering the cabinet, he had already earned the title of "Great Warrior Against Hunger." He studied the situation in Europe after the Napoleonic Wars and predicted the decline of American agriculture after the war. When he took office as Secretary of Agriculture, he was already an economist, scientist, statistician, and a bold visionary.</p>
<p>Regarding Wallace's childhood, there is a popular story that is told with great conviction. It is said that he grew up on an Iowa farm in dire straits, with only his beloved dog as a companion. In fact, Wallace did not grow up entirely on a farm, and his life was not lonely. He was the eldest son, born on October 7, 1888, in Adair, Iowa, followed by five siblings, so he was not alone at home. In reality, although Wallace was born on a farm, he grew up in a city and was not a complete country bumpkin.</p>
<p>Wallace's family environment and heredity helped him shape his life's work. There were three Henry Wallaces in his family, and he was the third. Henry Wallace the first was his grandfather, who ran a store in Des Moines and also founded a periodical called Wallace's Farmer. He was highly respected in the countryside and was known to all as "Uncle Henry." He was originally a Presbyterian pastor, but due to poor health, he moved to the countryside to farm. He often wrote letters to Iowa newspapers, and gradually became a journalist. "When Uncle Henry was the editor himself, the newspaper was filled with earnest and moving teachings, and 'Good Farming, Clear Thinking, Right Living' was the motto, which still exists today. His newspaper made a great contribution to arousing the public interest of farmers in the American Midwest. The government once offered him the position of Secretary of Agriculture, but he declined it because he was indifferent to fame and fortune. His son and grandson later held this position in succession. When he passed away in 1916, his son, Henry Wallace the second, succeeded him as editor of the Wallace's Farmer.</p>
<p>Henry Wallace the third is the Vice President-elect. Before he entered school, a Black man named Carver, who wanted to become a famous botanist, came to Ames for research and was cared for by Wallace's father. Out of gratitude, he often took Wallace on excursions, pointing out and explaining the differences between various plants along the way. Through this patient guidance, Wallace began experimenting with cross-pollination at the age of eight, and received Carver's praise.</p>
<p>Later, the family moved to Des Moines, and Wallace continued to experiment with flowers and strawberries. When he studied mathematics in school, he also became interested in collecting statistics. When his family went to the countryside for outings, his siblings each carried paper and pens to record all the pits, pigsties, horses, and other things they saw along the way.</p>
<p>When he was seventeen, he visited a maize exhibition at the office of his family's periodical, where maize experts from Ames served as judges. Wallace's eyes followed their guidance and comments. When the awards were given and the visitors had all dispersed, only Wallace remained standing still. A look of doubt was in his blue-gray eyes. The judge asked him why. Wallace blushed and said that Iowa maize was originally grown for feeding pigs, and if judged by aesthetics, it was inappropriate. Pigs are stupid creatures, what do they know about aesthetics! The judge was amused and not angry, and gave him a bag of the thirty-three kinds of maize that had won awards, instructing him to plant them and then judge them himself.</p>
<p>Wallace took them home and planted them in the backyard. When autumn came, he harvested them separately and counted them one by one, staying up all night. He found that the maize seeds that had won the first prize had the lowest yield among the ten kinds, while the ugly and deformed maize seeds had the richest harvest. This was the starting point of his successful agricultural experiments. For the next twenty years, he studied tirelessly every night and on Saturdays and Sundays, accumulating notes that were a foot high and creating precise records and endless formulas. By 1920, his hybrid maize had won awards, and he had created a new standard for judging maize.</p>
<p>He made many other innovations after going to Ames specialized school. When he studied nutritional chemistry, he questioned the theories. He temporarily acted as an experimental guinea pig to test his own ideals. He first fasted for a week to see if any accidents would occur. On the seventh day, he got a batch of oranges from a peddler, and his fast ended. Then he experimented with several simple diets based on his research. He had an ideal in his mind: to plan a minimum-cost living expense, hoping that the daily consumption would not exceed five US cents.</p>
<p>His curiosity about diet still exists today. During his tenure as Secretary of Agriculture, he did not eat meat for five years, believing that humans can be healthy without meat. He also tried drinking bean curd juice, but had to give up because it did not suit his taste.</p>
<p>In 1921, his father was recruited into the cabinet by Republican President Harding as Secretary of Agriculture, and he succeeded him as editor of Wallace's Farmer. The post-war agricultural depression had already begun at this time, and his editorials always advocated automatically reducing production to adapt to the shrinking foreign markets. He also had the enthusiasm of an evangelist, spreading his gospel to farmer gatherings. Although he was not good at speaking, he always looked at the ceiling and spoke non-stop. The farmers liked him, but they did not understand what he meant by linking local difficulties with the situation in Europe. When friends and relatives saw his failure, they comforted him with words, but he always said, "We have not suffered enough." He firmly believed that perseverance and hard work can be enlightening.</p>
<p>Although the farmers did not sympathize with him, they were honest, but the merchants of Des Moines were not willing to forgive him. One day, when he was speaking at a luncheon club, a member stood up and pointed at him and said, "Henry Wallace, you are a dangerous person."</p>
<p>President Harding also felt that this young Wallace was a dangerous person. One day, he called the Secretary of Agriculture to his office and coldly handed him a review from Wallace's Farmer, asking him, "Are you supporting me or opposing me?" It turned out that this review had completely torn apart Harding's shipping subsidy plan. Wallace's father had to state that although his name was still on the newspaper's masthead, his son was actually fully responsible. Harding had no choice but to drop the matter.</p>
<p>In August 1929, while Wallace was abroad attending an international agricultural conference, his family bought another rural newspaper, merging it with Wallace's Farmer, despite his telegraph protests. At this time, the Great Depression had begun, and soon all of Wallace's family's capital was lost. Fortunately, the new owner of the newspaper allowed Wallace to be the editor, giving him complete freedom. Many of the sharp sentences Wallace wrote in his subsequent reviews were quoted by Roosevelt during the 1932 campaign.</p>
<p>Wallace's recognition of Roosevelt was due to the introduction of the current Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Morgenthau Jr. At that time, he only knew that he was a farmer and the publisher of a rural magazine. Roosevelt invited Wallace to Hyde Park for a private discussion in 1932, and they became close friends at first sight.</p>
<p>In November of that year, Iowa joined Roosevelt's embrace, casting a Democratic vote for the first time in forty years. After the election victory, Wallace and Roosevelt had a meeting, so his invitation to join the cabinet as Secretary of Agriculture was not unexpected.</p>
<p>The first thing Wallace did after taking office as Secretary of Agriculture was to move his father's portrait from the dark corridor and hang it above his desk, so that they could face each other at all times. In the early days of the New Deal, he was quite unconventional, wearing baggy clothes and sitting with his legs apart. Sometimes he would play ball on a nearby court in the morning, and if it rained, he would still wear short socks. He was hesitant when he first entered a meeting, but before the end of the meeting, he was able to control it freely.</p>
<p>By ordinary standards, Wallace is still a poor man today. He only has some stable income from a maize company in Des Moines. His wife owns more stock. His annual salary as a minister is fifteen thousand US dollars, the most he has ever earned in his life.</p>
<p>Wallace's wife has a gentle nature and beautiful appearance, and she is quite tolerant of her husband's eccentricities. She is from Oskaloosa, Iowa. She met Wallace through an introduction from a sorority at Drake University and married him in 1914.</p>

<h3 id="e36">The United States Gains New Courage, Isolationism Overwhelmed, Assistance to China and Britain Will Become Stronger, Fight for Freedom with Free Will, Shanghai Newspapers Unanimously Praise the Success of the US Election <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Regarding Roosevelt's overwhelming victory over Willkie in the US election, all people who love justice and freedom in the world believe that this is a sign that the aggressors are about to lose. Therefore, Chinese and foreign newspapers have unanimously written articles to congratulate Mr. Roosevelt. Yesterday, the local English-language evening newspaper published an article commenting that Mr. Roosevelt's election for a third consecutive term is clear proof that the United States has stopped its appeasement policy and overwhelmed isolationism. The article is extremely insightful. The translation is as follows: American expatriates in the Far East have no preference between Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Willkie, but they warmly welcome Mr. Roosevelt's re-election. Because the policies outlined by the two men and the platforms of their Democratic and Republican parties are sound and reasonable for all important issues in the Far East, and are almost unanimous, what we want to worry about is:</p>
<p>American Overwhelms Isolationism</p>
<p>Mr. Roosevelt's re-election not only provides a concrete guarantee for the continuation of this policy, but also shows to Japan and its totalitarian partners that the American people have now overwhelmed isolationism and appeasement policies. In this historic election, we have gained a significant understanding, that is, the American people have courage and foresight. The American people's basic belief in democracy has not disappeared, but has been renewed.</p>
<p>Uphold Democracy and Fulfill Responsibilities</p>
<p>Some may think that the American people have surrendered themselves to the hands of a dictator. In fact, the opposite is true. Because the American people firmly believe that Roosevelt will not fail his high position as president, because he deeply feels that Mr. Roosevelt has shown himself to be a supporter of democracy in his past two terms, and because Mr. Roosevelt's policies have been carefully weighed and are sure to maintain and promote the free ideals that the United States relies on for its founding, so most of them elected Mr. Roosevelt to continue as president for four years. It is true that a president being re-elected for three terms is unprecedented in historical tradition, but this is known to the people, and they do it knowingly, which shows the rationality of the election results.</p>
<p>The Times Need Him to Take Office Again</p>
<p>We in the Far East believe that if Mr. Willkie had won the election, it would not have been a shock, and the views of the American people are also the same. Because the two candidates in this election were both outstanding figures, if it were not for a time of crisis, Mr. Willkie would have had a great chance of victory, just like another Roosevelt with greater prestige in the past, who could not be re-elected for a third term because of the lack of driving force from the crisis.</p>
<p>Help China and Britain Consistently</p>
<p>After analyzing the process of this election, we firmly believe that the American people have shown a clear mind and courage. Although they have calmly weighed the advantages of Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Willkie and the Democratic and Republican parties during the heat of the election, we firmly believe that the reason for Mr. Roosevelt's re-election is largely due to the fact that his and his party's policies have been tried and tested, and at this time, it is impossible to abandon a leader who is familiar with the road and take a new leader who is trying his talents for the first time. We now wish the whole country unity, a determination to strengthen national defense, and a thorough government policy of assisting China and Britain. In this election, we can see that the free people of free countries have issued their free will and are fighting for freedom. We privately hope that the aggressors who are trying to transform the United States have been greatly disappointed, and in this disappointment, the great hope of the world has been conceived.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Shanghai Media's Expressions <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The English-language Ta Kung Wan Pao said that the re-election of US President Roosevelt for a third term is unprecedented. Shanghai generally expresses [blank], which can be proved by the editorials of various Chinese and foreign newspapers in the city. The general comments in the editorials of various newspapers are that as a result of President Roosevelt's re-election, the United States will continue to pursue its tough foreign policy and</p>
<p>Intensify Assistance</p>
<p>Countries Fight for Democracy to Resist Extreme Countries. Several newspapers in this small city only re-tell what has already been seen in the news column, without expressing a clear opinion on the US presidential election. The German-language Far Eastern Daily News did not comment on this at all today (7th), but only published the election results in a key position, and still published the news of the sinking of a British ship in an important position. Overseas Shanghai</p>
<p>The General Japanese</p>
<p>Originally hoped that Willkie would win, but the result was the opposite, which was quite disappointing. However, they also believe that Roosevelt will be elected, so they are not very surprised by the election results. The Japanese-language Continental News and Shanghai Daily News both stated that this election is tantamount to the US constituencies giving a vote of confidence to President Roosevelt's continued</p>
<p>Aid China Policy</p>
<p>The Continental News said that it is expected that Washington will soon have a stronger anti-Japanese attitude. The election? Roosevelt's reelection for a third term is due to the fact that the American government's confidence in democracy has been challenged by the dictatorship of other countries. The American people were forced by dictatorship to take unusual steps and elect one person to serve a term as president.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Times said that the 165th anniversary of the establishment of the US Marine Corps is on the 10th of this month.

<p>Yesterday, it was rumored in Shanghai that China and the United States had established a new loan, the amount of which was 85 million US dollars, which had been formally signed by the Chinese representative in the United States and the US financial authorities. It was also said that the government would still use the new loan to order military supplies from various US arms factories.

<p>According to an official from the American Consulate General, while some quarters deeply believe that President Roosevelt will take more decisive action regarding the Far East abandonment policy in the future, it is not yet clear whether the government will take further measures regarding the evacuation of American residents. Therefore, some American residents are still adopting a wait-and-see attitude towards returning home. As of yesterday, the number of American residents applying to the consulate for subsidies for returning home has not increased. Perhaps American residents are paying attention to the election results and have no time for this. Regarding the evacuation of British residents, although the British authorities have not issued a formal statement, according to reporters, British residents who do not need to stay in Shanghai have individually received advice that the government will support them if they believe it is best to leave.</p>
<p>Advance Purchase of Tickets Still Very Active</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American President Lines still received a steady stream of applications from American residents seeking to pre-purchase tickets. According to an official of the company, there are still some empty cabins on the two special liners, the *President McKinley*, departing Shanghai on the 10th of this month, and the *President Washington*, departing on the 21st. The second and third class cabins of the *President Mariposa* have been reserved by American residents from North China and Korea, as this ship is the only one that will stop at Qinhuangdao and Busan after leaving Shanghai, in order to transport American residents from those places.</p>
<p>Estimate of Future Evacuation Numbers on Two Liners</p>
<p>According to shipping industry sources, the second special liner, the *President Mariposa*, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 9th, but may be postponed by one day. It is now known that only 82 women and children are scheduled to leave Shanghai on this ship. The third special liner, the *President Washington*, is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 17th, and 400 American residents are scheduled to leave on that ship, as it has many second and third class cabins, which can accommodate them.</p>
<p>*President Coolidge* Left Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>The American President Lines' *President Coolidge* arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 5th, carrying 629 American residents returning home from the Philippines and Hong Kong, and 201 American residents evacuating from Shanghai. It left Shanghai at 10:00 yesterday morning, passing through Kobe, Yokohama, Honolulu, and San Francisco, and arriving in Los Angeles. It is reported that Mr. Feng Ruo, a prominent American businessman who has lived in China for 30 years, has also returned home on the ship. Mr. Feng Ruo left the United States for China in 1912, initially working at the American Consulate in Tianjin. In 1932, he established Feng Ruo &amp; Co. in Hankou, engaged in the export of tung oil to the United States, with branches in Chongqing and Wanxian.

<p>According to *The China Press*, Mr. Cherikin, the publisher of a Russian-language newspaper in this city, made a long-distance call to Tokyo this morning (the 7th) to pay tribute to Ambassador Smetonine, the Soviet representative in Asia, and to congratulate the Soviet Union on the 23rd anniversary of the October Revolution. Mr. Cherikin said that tens of thousands of White Russian immigrants in Shanghai are pleased with the success of Stalin and Molotov's domestic and foreign policies and look forward to the Soviet Union forgiving the mistakes made by White Russian immigrants 23 years ago, not dwelling on the past, and extending a hand of friendship.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Quiet Before the Storm, Rice Prices Manipulated Again, Various Rumors, Suddenly Tight Market, Ningbo Compatriot Association Advocates Group Purchases for Compatriots <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai food market as a whole has been very calm recently due to the influx of foreign rice from domestic and overseas sources, and market transactions are gradually returning to normal. However, the market suddenly became tight the day before yesterday, and rice prices in various stores were frequently raised, and people's hearts were firm. It is said that due to the increasing sources of domestic and foreign rice, rice warehouses have suddenly increased their reserves, the market has stabilized, and rice prices have turned downwards. The entire rice market situation has been exceptionally stable. However, due to the unpredictable international situation, trading in various markets is not easy, and speculators have shifted their attention to hoarding food rice in an attempt to make huge profits without labor. Therefore, the spot market for rice has become scarce, and at the same time, speculative rice weevils and speculators outside the industry spread rumors, saying that there will be no more foreign rice shipments to Shanghai recently, or that it will be transferred to North China, or that domestic rice transportation is more difficult than before. The rumors vary and are not credible. Now, citizens have paid attention to group rice purchases after relevant parties advocated for it, and inquiries about procedures are endless.</p>
<p>Domestic and Foreign Rice Arriving in Shanghai Continuously</p>
<p>Since the beginning of last month, all the Tribute Rice that has been traded has been loaded onto domestic postal ships for shipment to Shanghai for sale. According to a survey by the rice industry yesterday, a total of 405,000 packages of Tribute Rice have arrived in these two weeks, which is enough to meet the monthly needs of the citizens. It is understood that 55,000 packages of Saigon No. 2 rice have already been loaded onto the Norwegian merchant ship *Deda*, which is expected to arrive in the next few days. According to sources in the rice industry, there is no danger of interruption in the supply of foreign rice. Moreover, those who hoard Hong Kong Tribute Rice and ship it to Shanghai have suddenly increased, and the supply of domestic rice is still not inferior to the past. Sudden price increases are undoubtedly attempts to manipulate the market.</p>

All Greek residents firmly believe that final victory will belong to Greece. Therefore, those who sympathize with Greece and are willing to contribute to the fund can pay at the Greek Consulate General. All funds will be used to rescue civilians who have been sacrificed in air raids.</p>

<h3 id="e48">American Churches Have Large Quantity of Winter Clothing, Soon to be Shipped to Shanghai for Distribution, To Be Distributed to Chinese and Jewish People for Warmth, Entrusted to the Salvation Army and Others for Distribution <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>According to *The China Press*, Mr. Sherlock, the representative of the Philadelphia Quakers in Shanghai, told reporters yesterday (the 6th) that the church has a large batch of winter clothing, originally intended to be shipped to Europe to relieve refugees, but will now be changed to be shipped to Shanghai to meet urgent needs. It is expected to arrive here next month and will be handed over to the American Advisory Committee, the Salvation Army, and the Jewish Refugee Committee in this city for distribution to Chinese and Jewish refugees for warmth.</p>
<p>Large Quantity of Winter Clothing Cannot be Shipped to Europe</p>
<p>Previously, the Philadelphia Quakers in the United States sent a telegram to the branch in this city a few days ago, stating that there is currently a large quantity of winter clothing raised in the United States, intending to be shipped to Europe. However, due to the implementation of blockades and other wartime restrictions by the belligerent countries, it is impossible to cross the Atlantic Ocean to ship to Europe. The Shanghai branch of the Quakers received the news and believed that this surplus winter clothing could meet the needs of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Urgent Request to Expedite Shipment to Shanghai</p>
<p>Therefore, they consulted with the American Advisory Committee, the Salvation Army, and the Jewish Refugee Committee, and then sent an urgent telegram, strongly stating that refugees in Shanghai urgently need this clothing, and all sizes are welcome. This telegram was sent to the China Relief Committee of the Church in New York and can be forwarded to the Philadelphia Quakers last night. The church's offices are all located on the east coast of the United States, while the large quantity of winter clothing is stored on the west coast of the United States.</p>
<p>Winter Clothing May Arrive After One Month</p>
<p>Therefore, it is expected that this city will not be able to receive a reply telegram in the next few days. However, after receiving the telegram, the Quakers are expected to ship the winter clothing immediately. If the shipment is carried out quickly, the winter clothing may arrive in Shanghai in one month. The branch of the Quakers is currently meeting with relevant charitable organizations to formulate measures for the storage and distribution of winter clothing. The weather has not turned cold in recent days, and it does not seem too late for the winter clothing to arrive in one month.</p>
<p>Poor and Distressed People Will Benefit Significantly</p>
<p>According to statistics, the mortality rate of poor people in Shanghai every winter is alarming, mostly due to starvation and cold. Now that this winter clothing is being shipped, and charitable organizations such as the Salvation Army are distributing food early, the number of poor people freezing to death on the streets in winter should be reduced.</p>
<p>Sheltering Beggars</p>
<p>The Salvation Army is now actively preparing to establish a beggar shelter, planning to accommodate 2,000 beggars and provide them with food and clothing. It is said that the location and admission methods have been discussed with the Municipal Council and are expected to be established at the beginning of next month. The army hopes that all sectors of society will donate winter clothing and quilts for use, as the expenses are enormous.</p>

<p>Since the opening of the Yunnan-Burma Road on the 18th of last month, the flow of international imports and exports has been very active, especially the import of military supplies, which is the most numerous. According to recent news from the shipping industry, vehicles on the Yunnan-Burma Road are now under the control of the authorities, and freight transportation has been considerably affected.</p>
<p>British Ships Suspend Service to Haiphong</p>
<p>As for Vietnam, only neutral country ships are currently operating, and the shipping business is also scarce. The French postal ship that departed from Vietnam last week could only sail to the Philippines and then to Shanghai, but could not sail to Hong Kong, because the French authorities prohibited French ships from sailing to ports of belligerent countries. British ships in Shanghai and Hong Kong have also abandoned shipping to that port, so there is no hope for the resumption of British ships to Haiphong and Shanghai for the time being.</p>
<p>French Ships Increase Shipping Routes</p>
<p>According to news from the French Postal Ship Company, the resumption of the Shanghai-Haiphong route by the company last week has been smooth. Now, in order to expand shipping, it has added a route to Nanyang and Japan. The route is Haiphong-Saigon, transferring to Nanyang-Manila, then sailing to Kobe, Japan, and then to Shanghai. The company's large postal ship *Datanan* officially started service on this route on the 4th. On the return trip, it will transport a large quantity of Tribute Rice ordered in Shanghai in Saigon. The company's cargo ship *Songtai* is also scheduled to sail on this route on the 10th of this month. If business develops, the ten French ships currently docked in Haiphong will be gradually put into service.</p>

<p>The iron gates in Nanshi bordering the French Concession, such as the sixteen docks, Xinkaihe, Xinqiao Street, Nanyang Bridge, and Xieqiao, have required a "Citizen's Card" or "Pass" to enter and exit since the Japanese suddenly implemented security measures on the 20th of last month. The public moved into the concession in droves because they couldn't bear the harassment. Recently, because of the huge bribes paid by various gambling tables, the invisible blockade of the iron gates resulted in few gamblers, and the Japanese authorities were negotiated to cancel the "Pass" system. Therefore, the method of entering and exiting with a pass was canceled the day before yesterday (the 6th) in the evening. However, the search work is requested to be stopped.</p>

<p>Mr. Nash, the Deputy General Manager of the Municipal Council, declared to reporters yesterday that although the Public Concession authorities and the Japanese authorities are mutually discussing to avoid the incident of the Japanese military police detaining police officers on Sunday (the 3rd), no new temporary agreement is planned for the entire issue of organizing a "joint police authority" in the road construction area outside the boundary. According to *The China Press*, it was reported in the newspapers of this city yesterday (the 6th) that the Municipal Council may conclude a temporary agreement with the Japanese authorities to avoid the same incident involving police officers on Jessfield Road last Sunday. Today (the 7th), Mr. Nash, the Deputy General Manager of the Municipal Council, has reiterated this. According to Mr. Nash's explanation, what he calls a new temporary agreement should not be confused with the temporary agreement signed between Mr. Fessenden and Mr. Chu Hsiao-an in February of this year, as that agreement covers issues such as police authority and taxes.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Shooting Bloodbath at Central Travel Agency Last Night, Two Killed and Wounded, Chen Youliang Died on the Spot, Yuan Quangen's Injuries Also Critical <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>At approximately 5:45 pm yesterday, a shooting assassination occurred suddenly in room 522 of the Central Travel Agency at 522 Wuma Road. Two murderers came, firing three shots, and two passengers in the room were shot, one dead and one wounded. As a result, the murderers escaped with their weapons. The details learned are recorded below:</p>
<p>Guests Filled the Room, Suddenly a Murder Occurred</p>
<p>Room 521 of the Central Travel Agency was opened by a Mr. Xi Xiangsheng (nickname A'er) from Changzhou. It has been a week since the room opened, and many friends must come to the room every day to talk or gather for mahjong games. At approximately 5:00 pm yesterday, the room was filled with guests, gathered for mahjong, and several others were watching. At that time, two young men suddenly broke in from outside the room, without carrying pistols. One of the men held a gun and fired two shots in a row at a 30-year-old man in a Western suit, hitting his head. He fell to the ground immediately. Another shot, a stray bullet, hit another man next to him, entering from the back of his chest and not exiting. He also fell to the ground. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the murderers immediately escaped with their guns from the travel agency's winding staircase. However, according to witnesses, there were a total of four murderers. In addition to the two who entered the room to shoot, there were two others guarding the vicinity of the room and the foot of the stairs.</p>
<p>Three Shots Fired, One Dead and One Wounded</p>
<p>Room 521 is opposite the tea room entrance, so the tea room witnessed the murderers firing and escaping, and could not stop them. They immediately reported to the accounting room, which reported to the Laozha Police Station, which immediately dispatched a large number of Western detectives and Chinese detectives, including Zhang Keqin and Sun Dafa, to investigate, and summoned an ambulance to send the two injured to Renji Hospital. One of them died before reaching the hospital due to a fatal head injury. According to investigations by reporters who rushed to the scene upon hearing the news, the deceased was Chen Youliang (30 years old) from Wuxi, wearing a dark blue serge Western suit and a dark gray flannel coat. He used to work in the police force and is now said to be affiliated with some kind of army in Wuxi.</p>
<p>Martial Law Search Arrested Passengers</p>
<p>It was later learned that Chen Youliang arrived in Shanghai from Wuxi by train at approximately 10:00 am yesterday. Because he knew Xi Xiangsheng, the owner of the room, he went to the room to play. The other injured person was Yuan Quangen (27 years old) from Wuxi, wearing a coffee-colored velvet robe, yellow leather shoes, and a monk's head. The bullet hit his chest, and he was seriously injured. After being shot, he limped to the tea room entrance, falling on a chair. His wife ran out to support him. Police officers found two bullet casings in the room and kept them for investigation. Afterwards, the travel agency temporarily implemented martial law, and all passengers entering and leaving were subject to inspection before being allowed to move. Six passengers were found in a certain room, whose behavior was suspicious, and they were arrested and taken to the police station for investigation.</p>

<p>Tang Jishan, a Cantonese tea tycoon and the husband of the late movie star Ruan Lingyu, was suddenly kidnapped and went missing yesterday. Tang is a tea industry tycoon and lives at Room 71, Racecourse Apartment, 233 Racecourse Road, Shanghai. Because Tang opened China Tea Co., Ltd. at 108 Ningbo Road, he goes to the company to work every day and has a car number 2265 as transportation. Usually, the car is placed at the Dahua Automobile Company on Mai'ertehesi Road. At about 9:30 yesterday morning, Tang ordered the driver, Mr. Hu (25 years old) from Yizheng, Jiangbei, to drive the car to the front of the apartment. Tang, wearing a Western suit, went downstairs and went out the door. Just as he was about to step into the car, three kidnappers suddenly jumped out from the roadside. Two held pistols and successively got into the car, squeezing Tang in the middle. They threatened the driver to drive west. At the intersection of Daxilu Yidingpan Road, the three bandits drove the driver down, and one bandit drove away himself, speeding away without knowing where. After Mr. Hu watched the car leave, he reported the situation to the police station. The car was found on Xiaoshadu Road at about 3:00 pm. Tang is currently 46 years old. Since Ruan Lingyu passed away, Tang and Song Hai live in the apartment.</p>

<p>Zhu Hua (22 years old) and Zhu Shu (18 years old), two young men from Shaoxing, residing at No. 10, Leimi Lane, Leimi Road, were still students. At 7:00 pm on the 5th of this month, they went out together and saw a hooligan youth, Xu Genfu, at the intersection of Ladu Road and Lafayette Road. They were blocking the road and teasing a passing woman, using frivolous words. The Zhus saw it and were outraged, and stepped forward to interfere, causing</p>
<p>a verbal conflict. At that time, a French police station patrolman No. 368 was passing by. Seeing that the Zhus were arguing, he stepped forward to inquire. The two sides started arguing again due to the inability to communicate. Unexpectedly, Zhu Hua actually took out a foreign knife that he had used as a Boy Scout and intended to resist the patrolman. Seeing Zhu Hua using a weapon to commit violence, the patrolman immediately opened fire as a warning. The bullet hit Zhu Hua's abdomen, and he fell to the ground injured. Everyone at the scene scattered and fled. The patrolman reported to the French police station and summoned an ambulance to send Zhu to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Zhu</p>
<p>'s injuries were serious. After the doctor performed surgery and removed the bullet, he eventually died on the night of the 6th due to ineffective treatment. The hospital notified the police station, which sent detectives to the Taras Road autopsy center yesterday morning to transport the body. They notified the family and reported to the prosecutor of the Special Second Court, who arrived at the center at noon yesterday to examine the body and confirmed that the death was caused by a gunshot wound. The body was claimed by the family with a guarantee and transported to the funeral home for embalming.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Rice Merchants Are Adept at Speculation: Roosevelt's Election to a Third Term Will Drive Shanghai Rice Prices Higher <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Imported rice, after a previous drop of one yuan, rebounded yesterday due to Roosevelt's election in the United States, restoring confidence. It's believed that war between Japan and the U.S. is imminent, which will affect incoming rice shipments, and this is being used to artificially raise market prices. In reality, most rice market merchants are viewing the situation through a haze of cigar smoke, seizing every opportunity to speculate. Even if war between Japan and the U.S. occurs, it's not imminent, so why create this situation now? General floating speculators and small retailers had already bought in early, and local shops are following suit, driving prices up. If No. 2 Bank's stack of red rice sells again, it will reach 63 yuan. Fortunately, a large quantity of genuine goods was released, stabilizing the market. However, about 7,000 tons were newly ordered a few days ago, and Jian Yuan, Jin Fa, and others have continued to place near and far-term orders for No. 1 and No. 2 Saigon rice, totaling another 1,350 tons. No. 1 Saigon rice for December shipment is still only 72 yuan, and for immediate shipment, it's 75.8 to 76 yuan. No. 2 for immediate shipment is 72 to 72.5 yuan. Speculative hoarding activity was lively in the afternoon, and rumors of insufficient shipping space and unsettled telegrams caused the market to rise by about another half yuan. Ultimately, the increase was about one yuan higher than the previous day, with a total transaction volume of 14,500 bags.</p>
<p>Imported rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Yuezhou vessel, loaded with 2,167 bags from Hong Kong, arrived in port yesterday morning and berthed at the French Concession wharf for unloading. Also, the Norwegian merchant Hua Lun Yanghang's Haida vessel is expected to arrive today, carrying 1,658 tons of imported rice loaded in Siam, totaling about 17,000 bags. It is scheduled to berth at No. 15, the Bund, Beijing Road, for unloading.</p>
<p>The arrival of new粳尖 (Jingjian), 菉種 (Lüzhong), and wild rice is still limited, totaling only about a thousand 石 (dan). It's said this is due to control by a certain party, so the local shops still have strong demand. Therefore, the owners are still unusually firm on prices. If the prices of new粳 (Jing) and wild rice continue to rise sharply by one or two yuan, the price of new粳 (Jing) original package is 86 yuan, 82 or 83 yuan, and wild rice is 83.5 or 83 yuan. However, the tea variety has fewer outlets, and the supply and demand are similar, so there is no significant change, with the price at 79.5 or 77 to 78 yuan.杜洋尖 (Du Yangjian) rice is completely out of stock and there's no market. Due to the tight market for 粳尖 (Jingjian) rice, the glutinous rice market is also active, with distilleries and retail customers showing interest. The price is slightly tighter, with 宜溧白元 (Yi Libaiyuan) rice at 76 yuan, 常丹 (Changdan) at 75 yuan, Hong Kong 白元 (Baiyuan) at 73.5 or 71 yuan, and 糯菉 (Nuo Lü) at 61 or 60 yuan.</p>

<p>Flour: Yesterday's trading remained dull. Two factories on this street supply nearly 10,000 bags daily, which is sufficient to meet demand. The factories, seeing the slow customer sales and lack of raw materials, can only supply this street with their daily production. The factory price remains at 17 yuan, and the customer price is 18.5 yuan. It's unlikely that there will be any changes this week. The selling price of imported flour is also stagnant, as there's no news of incoming shipments. Both sales and purchases are quiet. The two major factories sold over 8,000 bags in total, and this street continued to sell 200 bags of Red Peach No. 4 flour. There was little change in the market.</p>
<p>Wheat: The source of wheat remained quiet yesterday. Aside from some sporadic arrivals of wheat from nearby suburbs, there have been no large shipments to Shanghai. It's said that only one ship of imported wheat ordered by Chinese factories has yet to arrive, so the supply of wheat is dwindling. The factories will soon have no wheat to use, but fortunately, production has sharply decreased, so they are still continuing production. As for the issue of buying wheat, due to various difficulties, it's almost hopeless. Wheat trading is unlikely to develop in the short term.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<h3 id="e61">Environment Improving, Domestic Debt More Excited Than Ever <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The securities gray market yesterday also attributed Roosevelt's election to a third term, ensuring continued support for China, which is absolutely beneficial. Short sellers in the market are extremely cautious due to the difficulty in borrowing shares. The circulating shares are still insufficient to meet demand, and outside investors are still actively buying. Market prices are still slowly moving higher. Various bonds are seeing new highs. Class C bonds are approaching 64 yuan, but while Class A bonds saw a high price of 71 yuan, they are only 7 yuan and 7.5 jiao higher than Class C bonds. Compared to the previous difference of 11 or 12 yuan between Class A and C bonds, Class A bonds are still cheap. On the environmental front, Japanese troops are gradually withdrawing, and the war situation is improving. After the close, there were rumors of a new Sino-American loan of $60 million USD being successful. This is likely the first sign of intensified support for China after Roosevelt's election. There should be new developments in the future. Yesterday, the buying momentum remained strong in the morning. Jiu Fu, Tong Shun, Hu He Ji, and Heng Fu all placed orders. Ren Chang and Heng Kang, the sellers, sold some, and Tong Kang and No. 25 sold back some, but demand still exceeded supply. The momentum suddenly tightened in the afternoon, with Class C bonds reaching a new high of 63.8 yuan. At that time, Xin Chang, Bao Chang, Ding Kang, Lian He, and Yong Kang were all searching for stocks. Hong Da also bought back some. Although Yong Feng, Shun Li, Sheng Da, and Heng Tai sold some, the market price decreased slightly, about 3 to 4 jiao, due to small retail sales by general investors. In the end, the price rose by one or two jiao to one and a half jiao. The total transaction volume was estimated at over 2.3 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 100 shares of Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory were traded at a price of 25.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, the stock market opened slightly weaker yesterday at the Zhongye Public Office, likely due to the fall in New York prices, but the trend soon turned firm, and stock prices recovered to the previous day's level. Trading in industrial stocks was consistent, rubber stocks were very active, and the stocks of various Dutch East Indies companies were especially lively, with significant price increases. The dividends issued by several Singapore companies were of considerable interest, so there were a lot of transactions in well-known stocks.</p>
<p>London, 6th (Wednesday) Dispatch: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East Central Commercial companies' stocks were flat. Only HSBC Bank shares showed a slight increase, up one pound each. Stocks registered in England were at 64 pounds, and those registered in Hong Kong were at 58 pounds, with prices offered but no buyers. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Two More Companies Issue Dividends <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Li Han Motor Co., Ltd., a British company, is scheduled to distribute its second interim dividend for this year on November 15, at 2 yuan per share in national currency. Including the first dividend of 2 yuan already distributed, the total dividend for this year is 4 yuan.</p>
<p>The British company Hui Tong Yanghang's managers Li Pai and Xi Menbu, two rubber companies, are both scheduled to pay the 1940 interim dividend on November 21, at a rate of 1 jiao per share in national currency.</p>
<p>Speculators continued to buy in the afternoon. Hong Kong telegraph was also included, but Chinese and foreign banks were still willing to sell, with small price fluctuations. The closing price for this month's U.S. dollar and Hong Kong telegraph was 6.0625 yuan, while the price offered but not traded was 6.0335 yuan. The late closing price was 3 pence and 90625 for British gold, and 6.0625 yuan for U.S. dollars. This month's price and the spot price were matched, and next month's price was 3 pence, 8 maru, 0625 for Central gold, and 6.0335 yuan for U.S. dollars, each tightening by 0.5625 and 0325 compared to the previous day's spot and next month's Central gold and U.S. dollar prices. There was no significant change this month.</p>

<p>Yesterday's 烚赤 (xiā chì) gold market saw prices fluctuate upward, with stronger buying interest. Silver companies and securities firms were first to act in the morning. By the close, it had reached 500 yuan 關外 (outside the customs). The foreign exchange market continued to soften later, and securities companies and silver companies bought again, raising the price to 5,550 yuan. Although many floating sellers took profits and sold some, the overall trend was still upward. The closing price was 5,540 yuan, 50 yuan higher than the previous day. The total trading volume for the day was over 2,000 taels. The price of jewelry gold in silver shops remained unchanged. 関金 (guān jīn) etc. remained flat.</p>
<h3 id="e66">烚赤 (xiā chì) Rebounds 50 Yuan <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Initially, prices were suppressed due to the report of long positions in the exchange market. The price was 5,465 yuan for 10 taels sold by silver companies to gold shops, a decrease of 25 yuan from the previous day. Later, silver companies came in and rebounded by dozens of yuan, with gold shops doing a deal for 10 taels at 5,490 yuan. However, money changers sold 20 taels to securities firms, lowering the price again to 5,470 yuan. Thanks to silver companies and securities firms buying in, the price rose to 500 yuan 關外 (outside the customs), with silver companies buying 10 taels from gold shops at 5,525 yuan. At noon, silver companies did a deal for 10 taels, closing at 5,520 yuan. The market was initially stable later, with silver companies doing a deal for 10 taels at 5,520 yuan. Gold shops suddenly gave 20 taels to silver companies, lowering the price by 10 yuan to 5,510 yuan. At that time, securities firms and silver companies still had strong buying interest, raising the price to 5,548 yuan. However, many floating sellers sold at high prices, causing a sharp drop of over 20 yuan, with silver companies selling 10 taels to securities firms at 5,520 yuan. Before the late close, 余号 (yú hào) needed to buy, and silver companies entered again, raising the price to 5,540 yuan at the close. As a result, the price was 50 yuan higher than the previous day. There was a fluctuation of 78 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash company's standard gold is over 10 yuan higher than 烚赤 (xiā chì), and the buying price is 30 yuan lower. The current standard gold is 50 to 60 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there are few open positions.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the 烚赤 (xiā chì) market price fluctuate upward. British and American gold pounds each rose by one yuan. British gold notes still saw little trading, and the market price was fixed as before. The price of American gold notes initially retreated to 15.66 yuan, but then gradually rose. The evening market reached a high of 16 yuan, a gain of 2 jiao compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes continued to decrease by 2 fen.

<p>The Silver Association has determined that starting from the 11th, stamped checks and cash will be treated the same. For ordinary silver industry checks, other than remittances, clearing between firms should be settled with stamped checks. If individuals go to redeem checks, they can be paid in cash or request a bank draft or remittance order, which is both convenient and avoids the risk of counting errors and theft. Recently, due to the abundance of cash in Shanghai, the Banking Industry Joint Reserve Committee, also due to the high risk of handling cash, sent a circular to all banks and firms yesterday stating, "In order to reduce cash handling, it is specifically stipulated that starting from November 11, this committee will collect foreign bank checks on behalf of each bank and firm, and should obtain a payment order from the payer. If the payer pays in cash, this committee may refuse to accept it and return the original check to the collecting bank or firm for collection."</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3 id="e71">Foreign Exchange Quiet, Cotton Yarn Surges Against Expectations, Double Horse Good, Remembering 5 Yuan <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sluggish yarn market rebounded sharply today. This is because the U.S. President was re-elected and the foreign exchange market was quiet and stable, causing disappointment for those who had sold short yesterday. At the same time, although there was no large-scale development in the purchase of spot yarn from Hong Kong, the demand for 32-count fine yarn was still strong. As a result, confidence soared, short sellers rushed to cover their positions, and the market moved straight forward, breaking through the 200 yuan mark. 1,200 pieces of cotton yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened in the morning with short positions looking down due to the U.S. election results, and pressure returned. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,180 yuan, down 12 yuan. At this time, it was heard that the exchange rate turned long after the market opened, and sellers were particularly active, falling slightly to 1,177 yuan. But as the price loosened, there were plenty of buyers, and 廣帮 (Guangbang) needed sporadic and continuous supplies. At the same time, it was heard that the exchange rate was trending downward, and buying interest suddenly tightened, with the situation rising rapidly, rising all the way to 1,218 yuan at the close. According to the transaction statistics for half a day, 6,370 bags were traded. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 25 yuan. The amount purchased by each gang is listed separately as follows: Hong Kong 570, Same Trade 5, 800, Total 6,370.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Trading Is Quiet, Cotton Prices Rise Slightly <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The situation for spot cotton is that prices are slightly higher. This is because the yarn market rebounded and the supply from all routes is still difficult, while the prices in rural villages are particularly high. So, although business is flat, goods are also scarce, and the cotton market is stable. Once trading begins, the market should be good or rising.</p>
<p>The international market price of cotton, the New York cotton market, yesterday was exceptionally excited due to Roosevelt's re-election. Purchases by speculators and some overseas cotton merchants, and later covering by some short positions, resulted in the closing price being three to five pounds higher than the previous day. India yesterday fell one rupee and more, including predictions.</p>
<p>The trading of imported cotton in Shanghai has remained exceptionally quiet recently. The factories have been quiet because everyone thinks the price of yarn has been unstable. But the minds of people in the same industry continue to be unusually determined.</p>

<h3 id="e73">New Hoarding Momentum Resumes, Sales Prices Stop Falling and Rise <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market saw renewed strength in the aftermath of the reassignment of Roosevelt and minimal fluctuations in foreign exchange. The new national households' intentions were restored. Trading turned brisk, and the sales prices stopped falling and rose. White goods and coarse cloth rose by 1 to 2.5 jiao, fine cloth and fine twill rose by 2.5 to 5 jiao, and bleached and dyed cloth rose by 5 jiao. Although each customer had difficulty loading goods, they still advanced payment in advance for sale, and local shops traded more than 600 pieces of various cloths. The Zhejiang Road and Ningbo Gang handled 200+ bleached, fine and colored cloths, the Fujian Gang handled 100+ colored and colored twills, the Hong Kong and Guangdong Gang handled 100+ bleached and dyed cloths, and the Northern Road, Yanjin Gang handled 130+ colored, coarse, flannel, and woolen cloths. Also, 1,150 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<p>Dong Cloth: The market trend turned firm, with white goods, fine cloth, and fine twill each rising by about 5 jiao per bolt. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth closed at 35.4 yuan, fine twill at 31.55 yuan, and Four Gentlemen Biji at 1.08375 yuan per yard, also rising by 1.625 fen compared to the previous day.</p>

<p>Recently, the soybean market has not been easy to stimulate because the supply from Tianjin and Qingdao has been continuous, other arrivals have been abundant, and the sales market has been sluggish. A lively taste had been presented once under the depreciation of prices by cargo owners a few days ago, but although the Hong Kong gang came to inquire continuously in yesterday's market, the volume was reduced again. Therefore, the overall situation is still a pattern of short-term tiredness and short-term skittishness. Only 600-700 bags of Tianjin beans were traded yesterday, priced at 38 to 37 yuan, and 200 bags of Sangyuan beans were traded, priced at only 30.05 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, 1,410 bags of beans, 2,175 bags of raw kernels, 150 bags of sesame seeds, and 400 cans of sesame oil, 1,980 cans of raw oil, were all shipped to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market, according to Dutch telecommunications, the price of red sand was US$2.580, C.I.F. raised by 6 cents, and the association's clearing also tightened accordingly. The spot price for Dutch red sugar was 54.2 to 55 yuan, and the 18th day money order was 57.5 to 55 yuan, up 5 jiao. 24 coarse white sugar was 71.5 yuan at the main stack and 41 yuan at the outer stack. Taikoo Chebai B Mark West Stack was 71.8 yuan, up 3 jiao, East Stack was 70.8 to 71 yuan, up 5 jiao.

<p>The first two batches of new goods that arrived were scarce because the stock of longan had already been empty, so the price was extremely high. Recently, there have been continued arrivals, so sales have frequently loosened, and the top circles have fallen by 70 to 80 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed rates unchanged. The unofficial market for British and American currencies initially loosened in the morning, but this was fleeting. After 9:30 AM, the market turned soft due to mediocre domestic and international news, leading to a very quiet sentiment. However, speculators came to the market to buy, giving the appearance of tightening. Because both Chinese and foreign banks were filling orders, price fluctuations were minimal. The evening closing price for British gold was quoted at 3/4 of a penny and 90.625, and the American exchange rate was 6.0625 yuan, compared to yesterday's closing price, with the British pound tighter by 0.015625 and the American dollar reduced by 0.03125. This month's futures and spot prices have leveled out, while next month's remain slightly apart.</p>
<p>A Slight Loosening in the Early Morning Soon Returned</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's large-scale decline approached 0.0625, while long-term rates remained stable. New York's silver price remained stable, and London's raw gold remained stagnant. Exchange rates between Britain and the US, Shanghai, etc., did not change. The US to British rate was long by 25, the rate to Shanghai did not change, and there was no market for the French rate. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. Banks opened with spot selling prices in the morning, with British gold at 3/4 of a penny and 92.1875, and the American exchange rate at 6.09375 yuan. Compared to the previous day's closing prices, there was no significant difference in the British and American exchange rates. After opening, a loosening trend appeared, with speculators initially selling off this month's US dollar at a transaction price of 6.1875 yuan, and then selling to Chinese banks, slightly returning to 6.15625 yuan. At 9:30 AM, HSBC's listed rates showed no changes. The silver equalization tax was low at 0.50%. Thereafter, the underlying trend softened, as speculators stopped selling and reversed, buying instead. However, as foreign and Chinese banks offered ample supply, the tightening was limited. It is estimated that this month, speculators bought US dollars from foreign banks at prices from 6.125 to 0.0625 yuan, while the Chinese banks' US dollar futures for December were offered to speculators at 6.0625 yuan. There were few changes at noon closing. The spot price for British gold was 3/4 of a penny and 90.625, and the American exchange rate was 6.0625 yuan, compared to the morning opening prices of 0.015625 and 0.03125 respectively.

<h3 id="e78">Recent Educational Measures in Guizhou Province: Promoting Advanced Industrial Vocational Education, Increasing Salaries for Teachers and Staff at All Levels <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>(Guizhou Correspondence) Since assuming office in May of this year, the Director of the Guizhou Provincial Department of Education, Ou Yuanhuai, has been actively working. The following is a summary of recent educational measures:</p>
<p>(1) Establishing a Provincial Senior Industrial Vocational School: The province originally had only three provincial vocational schools, while there were nineteen ordinary middle schools. The number of industrial classes in vocational schools was particularly small. To remedy this abnormal development and to meet the needs of various emerging industries in the province, it was deemed necessary to establish an industrial vocational school to cultivate suitable talent. Therefore, in June of this year, preparations began for the establishment of a provincial senior industrial vocational school. Gao Jiong was appointed as the chairman of the preparatory committee. The school's recurring expenses are budgeted at 105,000 yuan per year. The school site has been identified near Guiyang, and construction of school buildings has begun. Initially, two departments, mechanical engineering and civil engineering, will be established, and two classes will be enrolled, with a quota of 100 students. Classes will begin on schedule.</p>
<p>(2) Establishing an Editorial and Review Office: The Guizhou Department of Education originally did not have an editorial and review office. Director Ou established it upon assuming office. Important tasks include editing the Guizhou Education Monthly, editing supplementary teaching materials for various subjects, and current education laws and regulations. In the future, it is hoped that the editorial and review office will conduct internal research on various practical issues and provide the research results for reference, while also promoting research among educational workers throughout the province to improve their own work and gradually move towards administrative modernization.</p>
<p>(3) Holding a Summer Training and Discussion Meeting for Middle School Teachers: Summer training and discussion meetings for middle school teachers were originally held every year. This year, the order was received late. Guizhou's secondary schools have a summer vacation of only a little over a month, and transportation is inconvenient, requiring time for travel. Therefore, holding the meeting this year was particularly difficult. However, because this matter greatly helps middle school teachers' professional development, the Department of Education resolutely proceeded despite any difficulties. Although time was tight, 89 teachers from all over the province still participated. The meeting was divided into subject-specific training and discussions, as well as lectures, including the Guizhou Lecture, the Anti-Japanese War Lecture, the International Issues Lecture, and military training and management speeches. The lecturers for each subject were mostly well-known professors from universities such as Daxia, Zhejiang, and Xiangya. The speakers for the various lectures were mostly responsible personnel in charge of practical matters. All lectures were serious. The meeting ended at the end of August, and the participants still felt reluctant to part, regretting that it was too short. This shows that the meeting was handled seriously this time, and it is no wonder that all parties gave it unanimous praise.</p>
<p>(4) Convening a Discussion Meeting and Guidance Conference for Principals of Secondary Schools throughout the Province: Secondary education is one of the most important parts of provincial education. To effectively discuss various issues in secondary schools throughout the province, the Department of Education took advantage of the summer vacation to convene 19 principals of provincial secondary schools throughout the province to hold a discussion meeting. More than 50 issues were discussed, divided into six categories: administration, finances, teaching, guidance, counseling and research, and community education. The meeting was held on August 17 and 18. Regarding the guidance issue, in addition to the 19 principals, 19 teachers from the summer secondary school teachers' training and discussion meeting who were selected to serve as counselors in various schools also participated to hold an expanded guidance conference to discuss the leadership of youth ideology, military training, child training, the counselor system, and extracurricular activities, all of which are extremely important issues at present. This conference brought together those in charge of practical matters in schools from various places, reported on their personal experiences, and exchanged opinions with each other. It will surely make a great contribution to the reform of secondary education throughout the province in the future.</p>
<p>(5) Increasing Salaries for Teachers and Staff at All Levels of Schools: Recently, prices have risen sharply in various places. Those who rely on fixed salaries to maintain their livelihoods feel particularly difficult. In September, the Guizhou Provincial Government meeting resolved to increase the monthly salaries of civil servants in all subordinate agencies to provide relief. It was also decided at the same time that teachers and staff in provincial primary and secondary schools and staff in provincial community education institutions should be handled in accordance with the civil servant method. Therefore, the monthly salaries of teachers and staff in provincial schools and community education institutions can be increased by 20 yuan from September of this year.</p>

<p>Hangzhou Hongdao Girls' High School has been established for many years. Graduates have spread across the country. The bonds of classmates are strong, and communication is frequent. The organization of the alumni association is particularly robust. It is reported that the annual meeting this year is scheduled for 2:00 PM on Sunday, November 10, at Chongde Girls' High School, No. 30 Datong Lane, Seymour Road. A farewell will also be held for Ms. Moffett and Ms. Graham, who are returning to the United States.

Several hundred members of the alumni association, fellow Changshu natives, and students of the school attended.

<h3 id="e82">Charity Football Match for the Howard Cup: Sino-Western Committee Appointed Yesterday; Tournament to be Held Annually Hereafter; R克斯's Loaned Players' Lineup Announced <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The charity football match organized by the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education and Relief Center, between Donghua and R克斯, is scheduled for next Tuesday, the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birthday, at the Recreation Ground. To commemorate its late president, Gao Huaide, and his contributions to promoting sports, the Lido Sports Club has commissioned a magnificent silver cup, named the "Howard Cup," as a trophy. They plan to emulate the arrangements of the Mayling Construction Company Cup and the Raymond Cup, holding the tournament annually as a permanent fixture. To emphasize the importance of the event, four groups—the Shanghai Western Football Club, the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education and Relief Center, the Recreation Ground dog racing track, and the Lido Sports Club—have jointly organized the "Gao Huaide Memorial Cup Charity Football Match Committee." Nine Chinese and Western individuals have been appointed as committee members to promote the event annually. The appointed members are Lieutenant Liddell, Mr. Bridge, Mr. Bauset, Mr. Booth, Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Shen Siliang, Gao Huailiang, and Lu Zhong'en. Yu Qiaqing has been appointed as the chairman, with Lu Zhong'en serving as the secretary. Seven groups have been established: General Affairs (Cheng Zhiliang), Finance (Pan Hongding), Decorations (Zhang Zhihe), Documentation (Jiang Zhongze), Ticketing (Wei Huanzhang), Venue (Pan Zhuanfang), and Public Relations (Ling Jianming). Additionally, four officers—Yan Huigao, Jiang Xingsheng, Yang Hailei, and Hong Guangxiang—have been appointed to assist in all matters. Tickets for the first Donghua versus R克斯 match will go on pre-sale starting tomorrow; the location will be announced tomorrow.</p>
<p>R克斯's Lineup Announced Yesterday</p>
<p>The lineup for R克斯 has been announced as of yesterday. Four strong players from Beixitong, Sneijder, Trevoni, Lileo, and Gibby (also a member of R克斯 Club), have decided to play for them, making their strength unlike before. Center-back Burts was injured in the match against the Western Police, so Lileo from the Western Children's team will replace him. In addition to Simons and Attwood as forwards, Gibby from Beixitong will join. The left and right center-backs will be Xiang Nabauer and Trevoni from the Western Children's team. The full-backs will be Mata and Jack, and Sneijder's goalkeeping is particularly outstanding. The R克斯 lineup is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e83">Beixitong Protests Against the First Division Match Against Donghua; Dissatisfied with Zhang Le's Ruling <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>In the first division league match between Donghua and Beixitong last Sunday, Donghua won 2-1. However, in the last four minutes, Beixitong's center forward, Ingren, scored a goal, but it was ruled offside by referee Zhang Le and disallowed. Beixitong has now filed a protest with the Western Football Association, expressing their dissatisfaction with Zhang Le's refereeing.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Silver Coin Cup Table Tennis Tournament: Tongshang Double Success <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Ker Exchange Bank Defeats Sihai, Liu Jihan Excels. In the Silver Coin Table Tennis Tournament, Tongshang faced Exchange Bank and Sihai at the Silver Union Club last night. Although Tongshang had already secured the championship, their evenly matched talent made them a formidable middle-to-upper-tier team. Exchange Bank and Sihai had repeatedly suffered defeats in the league, with poor results. Yesterday, despite Tongshang's efforts, they were ultimately defeated by Tongshang due to their relatively weaker skills. As a result, Tongshang defeated Exchange Bank 13-3 and Sihai 13-4, which is commendable. Main player Liu Jihan excelled in both offense and defense, winning all seven matches, which was particularly outstanding. Among the three matches tonight, the outcome of the North America versus Zikang match is the most unpredictable. The results of last night and the schedule for tonight are detailed below:</p>
<h3 id="e85">Cai Ji Cup Individual Table Tennis Tournament: Battles Began Last Night <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The first "Cai Ji Cup" individual table tennis tournament, sponsored by Cai Ji Timber Company, officially commenced at 8 PM last night. With over a hundred spectators, the atmosphere was enthusiastic. Chen Linsheng delivered the opening speech, and Mr. Qi Desheng, the company's manager, reported on the preparations. The matches began with the sound of the silver bell from referees Chuan Guiqing and Feng Chanchu. The participating athletes displayed their skills and spirit, performing at a very high level. The second and fourth matches were the most exciting. Gong Bangfu and Chen Pei won their victories, while Xia Zaiyong and Qi Hongfang, although defeated, showed strong potential and should not be underestimated. There will definitely be fierce competition when they meet again in the second round. The championship will surely be contested among these four. The second act will be held tomorrow night, with the schedule announced later. After the matches, the company provided refreshments, and everyone dispersed in high spirits. The strategies of each match are detailed below:</p>

<h3 id="e86">One Hour in a Tram <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Ling</p>
<p>Among the various vehicles in the public concession, the No. 16 tram is the most crowded, dirtiest, and slowest. Because of where I live, I travel on this tram every day, spending a whole hour—from the starting point to the terminus—on the road. But perhaps I've gotten used to it and quite like riding it. And in those hundred-plus minutes each day, the different characters, different tones, and different expressions I see and hear on the tram are almost a microcosm of society. Let me write about what I saw and heard on my way home from Sanyangjing Bridge yesterday to prove my point. After the tram stopped on the Fourth Road, there were only three other people in the first-class compartment besides me. One was a policeman, and the other two were together. The tram only gradually livened up after those three got on. In fact, the policeman was as silent as I was; the lively ones were just those two: those two liked to talk a lot, and they didn't stop from the moment they got on until they got off.</p>
<p>"How was it last night? Victory or defeat?"</p>
<p>"Ugh! Don't talk about it, don't talk about it! A crushing defeat! Forty-six thousand!" replied the bespectacled man to the square-faced one.</p>
<p>"How could you have lost? I thought coming with these two guys would definitely be a winner," said the square-faced man as he paid for two tickets costing 12 cents each.</p>
<p>"Bad luck! I don't know how I lost," the bespectacled man shook his head.</p>
<p>The policeman got off, and a man and a woman, and three students got on, immediately scrambling for seats.</p>
<p>"稟子? Where to?" the ticket conductor stretched out his hand.</p>
<p>"Season!" the three students nodded in unison.</p>
<p>"Damn! Why is 'Dong Gua' so fierce today?" asked one of them carrying a suitcase to the one next to him.</p>
<p>"Who knows! I can't even see her, and Li Zhiming, that little devil, won't 'pass' it over!" said the one in a Western suit, pointing at the other.</p>
<p>"How can I 'pass' it over? 'Dong Gua' is standing right in front of me," replied the one called Li Zhiming.</p>
<p>From these few words, you could tell that these three were having a hard time during the exam.</p>
<p>At this moment, the tram gradually filled up. Two people who got on from the Fourth Road chatted for a long time before getting off. In their seats were two country folk, one of whom had a bag of rice between his legs. Suddenly, the tram stopped for a moment, and the passengers all lurched to the right, causing half the rice to spill out of the bag like lime. The two country folk quickly squatted down and used their hands to scoop it up and put it back in the bag, working diligently. This immediately sparked discussion among the passengers:</p>
<p>"Oh dear! What a pity!"</p>
<p>"Why is this fellow so careless!"</p>
<p>The student in the Western suit pointed at the country folk squatting on the floor and said to his two friends.</p>
<p>"Hey! It'll cost at least twenty yuan!" said a burly man, laughing.</p>
<p>"More than that! More than that! There must be five dou of rice here, which is worth forty-odd yuan!" said another.</p>
<p>The ticket conductor also chimed in:</p>
<p>"Enough for the poor to eat for several days!"</p>
<p>Just as the two country folk finished their work and sat up, the tram suddenly stopped again, followed by five rings of the bell. The ticket conductor immediately called out in a loud voice to the third class:</p>
<p>"OK!" A spirited reply came from over there.</p>
<p>The tram stopped, some people got off, and the two country folk, carrying the rice and saying "Excuse me," also got off. A blue-eyed, high-nosed ticket inspector got on and checked the tickets very carefully. Fortunately, the inspector had arranged everything during the five rings of the bell and didn't get "rejected." The one who got "rejected" was the student called Li Zhiming because he couldn't produce his "Season" ticket. He was kicked out by the "Russian" at the next stop and fined double the fare.</p>
<p>"Boss Wei! Where are you going?" a man wearing a worker's outfit with a peaked cap greeted a man in an overcoat who had just boarded.</p>
<p>"Oh! Caojiadu!" replied "Boss Wei," raising his hand. The ticket conductor then sold a ticket to someone next to him.</p>
<p>"Where are you going?" "Boss Wei" asked with a Shandong accent.</p>
<p>"Also Caojiadu," replied the man with the peaked cap with a smile.</p>
<p>"Business must be good these days?"</p>
<p>"Not bad, not bad! Small business," he smiled again.</p>
<p>From the whispers of the two next to me, I finally understood what kind of people these two—the man with the peaked cap and "Boss Wei"—were, and what their so-called business was all about. But I didn't have much money in my pocket, and since I had no watch or overcoat, I didn't need to "worry about things that don't concern me." I was at ease, especially since I was only three stops away from my destination.</p>

<p>— Xi</p>
<p>As the great wheel of time turns into autumn, everyone is busy with a major event—marriage. Just look at the engagement and wedding advertisements in the newspapers, they're bustling with activity. You might as well take a stroll down Nanjing Road, where the major companies are packed with people. Some are preparing dowries, while others are getting ready for "wedding feasts" by preparing fashionable clothes. If you carefully calculate their expenses, it's truly astonishing. Not counting the betrothal gifts and jewelry exchanged between the marrying parties, just the dozens of tables of delicacies (including additional expenses) cannot be properly handled without thousands of yuan. Other miscellaneous expenses are impossible to calculate. Their wedding affects relatives and friends, who spend even more. Especially women, who love fashion and easily compete with each other at wedding halls. The so-called tightwad at ordinary times, cannot but care about face.</p>
<p>A friend's wife spent nearly two hundred yuan on her cousin's wedding attire. I once made a calculation for her: a lined overcoat cost eighty yuan, a lined cheongsam thirty yuan, new high-heeled shoes twenty-odd yuan, silk stockings ten-odd yuan, hair perm four yuan, manicure one yuan, and other rouge and powder are not counted. The total reached hundreds of yuan. She herself was still quite dissatisfied with these. If that's how much one person spends, the total amount is shocking!</p>
<p>I once heard a tailor say: "If all we made were men's clothes, we wouldn't even have enough to eat gruel. To be honest, our livelihood depends entirely on women's clothes. First, women's clothes require less labor and save more silk thread than men's clothes. Second, men's clothes don't change as much as women's clothes. If we only made men's clothes, we would starve to death. Third, the labor cost for women's clothes is much higher than for men's clothes. It's not too much to charge four or five yuan for making a cheongsam!" In Shanghai, there are countless people who rely on women for their livelihoods!</p>
<p>(Editor's note: Although it cannot be generalized, it is truly a heartfelt sentiment; correct it if it exists, and encourage it if it does not!)</p>
<p>The Hawthorne Detective Agency</p>
<h3 id="e88">The Final Destination of the Dancing Queen <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— By Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 10: The Shoe Problem</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou followed Hawthorne back to where the car was parked, with a look of disappointment and suspicion. After stopping, he asked Hawthorne: "Why didn't you ask more questions?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne replied: "There's no point in talking too much, it'll only leave traces. What kind of person is this Old Han?"</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou said: "He used to be a detective in the South District Police Station and now works in the Garrison Headquarters. This person is quite clever and has a good way with words. He said Zhao Boxiong has gone to Nanjing, but I don't really believe it."</p>
<p>Hawthorne pondered for a moment and said: "But since He Sheng isn't here, Zhao Boxiong may not be in this shop either. I think you should quickly make a phone call to the office and ask if there's been any further news about He Sheng. If Zhao Boxiong has really left this shop and is going to Nanjing, then we might still be able to make it to the train station in time... Hey, Jinshou, you need to send two more people here and tell them to pay attention to everyone who goes in and out of this shop."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou agreed with Hawthorne's suggestion and immediately went to a soy sauce shop on the corner to make a phone call. Hawthorne continued to watch the small tobacco and paper shop. Two or three minutes later, when he came back out, he frowned and shook his head. Not only had He Sheng not reported in, but another detective, Song Quan, was also missing.</p>
<p>Hawthorne hesitated for a moment and said: "Then let's go to the Public Security Hospital and see how Li Zhifan is." Ni Jinshou naturally had no objection. We got in the car and headed to the government-run Public Security Hospital. Hawthorne expressed his sincere hope while the car was moving.</p>
<p>He said: "I hope Li Zhifan's injuries aren't fatal, and that he can at least speak in the short term, which would save me some effort."</p>
<p>This statement was very reasonable at the time. He clearly hoped that Li Zhifan himself could identify the gunman who shot him, which would naturally reduce the effort Hawthorne would have to put into the investigation. Who knew this was a misunderstanding? His words had a double meaning.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the Public Security Hospital, Hawthorne's expectations were neither close nor far. According to the head nurse in charge, Li Zhifan was in the operating room having the bullet removed and could not receive visitors. He was certainly not dead yet, but no one was sure whether he could fulfill Hawthorne's hope of speaking to him in person. Ni Jinshou made another phone call from the hospital to the office to inquire about He Sheng's whereabouts again. The result was that He Sheng's trail remained as elusive as a stone sinking into the sea, but Song Quan had reported to the office. (168)</p>

<h3 id="e90">Western Puppets and Eastern Shadow Plays <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— In Chan</p>
<p>In the world-famous cartoon feature film "Pinocchio," there is a scene where the little puppet Pinocchio is tricked by two villains—the fox and the cat—into joining a puppet theater. The creator, Walt Disney, also said in his account of making the film: "Pinocchio is a biographical novel by Collodi, whose real name was Lorenzini. He wrote this book when he was forty-four years old (1870). At that time, puppet shows had been popular in Europe for hundreds of years. Collodi's book is popular all over the world, with millions of copies sold. There are translations in various countries, and countless reprints. Some public libraries have as many as thirty-three editions, with illustrations by art experts from various countries." This shows that puppet shows were indeed popular in the West hundreds of years ago.</p>
<p>But according to research, this type of drama first appeared in China during the Song and Yuan dynasties (1139-1280). Books such as "Tokyo Dream Records," "Old Affairs of Wulin," and "Dream Millet Records" all say that puppet shows were most popular during the Song dynasty, with the most diverse types, including string puppets, wire puppets, rod puppets, gunpowder puppets, flesh puppets, and water puppets. "Dream Millet Records" also says: "Puppets elaborate on stories of smoke and powder, spirits and monsters, iron cavalry cases, historical books, dynasties of emperors, generals, and ministers, or storytelling, or miscellaneous dramas, or cliff words... In general, these plays are mostly false and few are true, such as the stories of Giant Spirit God and Zhu Ji the Great Immortal."</p>
<p>In addition, there was also a type of "shadow play" that developed alongside puppets during the Song dynasty. Volume 9 of "Record of Things and Origins" says: "During the reign of Emperor Renzong of the Song dynasty, there was a market person who could tell the story of the Three Kingdoms, or embellish the story with shadow plays, starting with the image of Wei, Wu, and Shu fighting for supremacy." "Tokyo Dream Records": "The arts of the capital include shadow plays and graceful shadow plays, Sheng Yun during the Southern Song Dynasty." "Dream Millet Records": "Shadow players initially used plain paper to carve clusters of shapes. Later, people became more skilled and used sheepskin to carve shapes and decorate them with colors so that they would not be damaged... The stories are quite similar to those told in storytelling books, generally mixing truth and falsehood, carving loyal characters with righteous faces and treacherous characters with ugly faces, thus embodying praise and criticism in them."</p>
<p>According to the above, although ancient puppets and shadow plays were just small toys and not real dramas, they all focused on performing stories. On the one hand, they had to cater to the audience's psychology, and on the other hand, they were popular in the East and West. It can be generally agreed that they contributed to the progress and success of drama. However, who would have dreamed at the time that puppet shows would evolve into novel cartoons and ancient Eastern shadow plays would evolve into modern movies!</p>

<p>— Theatrical People Traveling South</p>
<p>Shu Yan, a key figure in theatrical movement, left Shanghai for the Shaoguan area in September to work. Recently, he wrote in a letter: "The authorities in Guangdong Province are quite interested in expanding the theatrical movement. I recently discussed this with Chen Zhigao (note: Chen is a lawyer in Shanghai who has invested in publishing the "Wenxian" monthly magazine, etc., and is currently the chairman of the Guangdong Relief Committee), and we were both very excited. Brother Zhigao said: 'If comrades from the Shanghai theater community are willing to form a team and go south, we will find a way to remit travel expenses, and after they arrive here, we can ensure that they have a good time'..."</p>
<h3 id="e92">"Home" Brought to the Silver Screen: Ba Jin and the China Union Signed a Contract Yesterday, Zhou Yibai Introduced the Soffe Representative to the Author <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Luo</p>
<p>Ba Jin's trilogy "The Torrent" ("Home," "Spring," and "Autumn") uses a collapsing feudal family as its theme, and each character is written very realistically, thus gaining a large readership. The China Union Film Company believes that this is a great subject for making a movie, so it entrusted Zhou Yibai, an old friend of Ba Jin, to conduct negotiations. After many letters and telegrams, Ba Jin agreed to sell the film rights of "Home" to the China Union ("Spring" and "Autumn" can be made into films first). Because Ba Jin is currently in Chongqing, he entrusted Soffe to represent him, and the contract was signed yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>A reporter from Haixing News asked Soffe: "What are Ba Jin's opinions on bringing 'Home' to the silver screen?" He claimed: "Nothing much, but he wants to see the movie script after it's written, in case there are any places that are different from the original book." The reporter also asked Zhou Yibai: "Will you be responsible for adapting the script?" He replied: "Probably. But it's not completely decided yet." He also said: "There are as many as forty or fifty characters in the original book, which is easier to allocate with the China Union's current cast of actors."</p>
<p>Zhang Shankun, the owner of China Union, said: "We will make this literary masterpiece with the utmost caution. Filming will probably begin within the year, but the release date will be as early as February or March of next spring."</p>

<p>— Stars</p>
<p>—A Personal Statement to Avoid Misunderstandings</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspapers all published a news item stating, "Bai Hong submitted her resignation to the China Union Drama Department a few days ago... seeking new development..." To find out the truth, the reporter made a special visit to Bai Hong yesterday. According to her own words, "This news is completely untrue. As for the claim that Bai Hong informed the company's drama department a few days ago that she should not be assigned any roles in new plays in the future, Bai Hong said that she had never informed them of this. The matter of seeking new development is even more fictitious. However, she herself speculates that the news may have spread because some time ago, someone contacted Bai Hong and asked her to go to Ping to join a film company to make films, but she politely declined at the time. Also, Qingdao once asked someone in Shanghai to invite Bai to perform in Qingdao, but Bai Hong did not agree in the end."</p>
<p>Based on the above speculation, discerning people should be able to understand this.</p>
<p>In the final analysis, Bai Hong completely denied the rumors of "resigning from China Union and seeking a new path." Moreover, she also received a notice from China Union yesterday, asking her to go to "Ma Wu's Shepherdess" to serve as a consultant for several musical and dance scenes. At the same time, China Union said that Bai Hong's new work, "Zhuo Wenjun," will soon begin filming, probably after January.</p>
<p>Below is a statement written in Bai Hong's own handwriting, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>After reading "Where is Bai Hong Going?" in your column yesterday, I was very surprised. Since entering the film industry, I have been valued by all sectors of society, which I find very gratifying. I am currently serving Xinhua, hoping to contribute more to the art world. How dare I seek new development or find a new path? To avoid misunderstandings from all sectors of society, I hereby declare the above. To the editor of the entertainment world</p>
