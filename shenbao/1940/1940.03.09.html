<p>社評</p>
<h3>燃料問題</h3>
<p>上海生活恐慌高潮，雖經各方努力維持，猶在方興未艾中。而燃料問題，所予一般生活之威脅，其嚴重正不亞於民食問題。蓋民非水火不生，上海一般家庭所賴以舉火者，在先多用柴炭，自煤球推行，乃取柴炭而代之，此亦自然之趨勢，以上海之屋少人稠，凡日用之品，能少占儲藏地位，而其效力不减者，自必爲人所樂用。此外用煤油煙白煤以煮食者亦不在少。燃料在平時供求相稱，不覺其貴，近則非同昔比矣，煙煤每噸二百一二十元，白煤一百七八十元，柴一元箍半，炭十餘元一担，煤油十四五元一聽，煤球一百二十元一噸，猶以爲平沽，虧蝕堪虞，深恐難乎爲繼；然各物之價較之戰前俱高五六倍矣。</p>
<p>何以漲度如是之高，此固不外乎供求與成本之關係，要亦特殊勢力有以促成之也。溯自戰事發生，上海與各地間之交通，發生變化；而內地物產之輸人上海者，百物皆爲變相之統制，誅求無饜，勒索甚苛，而成本奇重。及其運達上海，動遭扣留，即如柴薪一項，自臘底至今，悉數被扣，迄未放行，不知其意果何居也。今者煤自吳淞進口，若未運至碼頭裝卸，尙不能認爲貨已安然到達，蓋往往有中途被截，迫令轉賣故也。夫處於不安定之環境中，物價奚有安定之望。再加以歐戰發生，水脚飛漲，印煤一噸運到上海，需費三十二先令，安南煤一噸需二十七先令，如以法幣計算，每噸水脚，已高至八九十元，若是而望其價格牛落，不亦如南轅而北轍乎。夫印煤之在煤市塲中，本絕微末，今則已居於主要供給之地位，有非此而不得舉火矣。白煤向有柳江山西等貨，源源濟用，自遭淪陷，而來源驟阻，胥仰給於鴻基等白煤矣。素爲煙煤大量供給之開平煤，到貨之少，亦出意外，故其價格雖平，而市上不易購得。向時日本運滬銷售之煤，數量亦鉅亦足可與開平諸煤相頡頑。近爲其本國亦患煤荒，雖仍有少數運滬★但以供給日廠所需，尙苦不敷，而華北煤產，復爲日方綑載以去，遂使上　用煤，有非南求不可。上海煤商見有機可乘，啟居奇之念，縱存貨山積，亦不肯應市，於是市塲之貨愈缺，煤荒之情勢愈岌岌矣，</p>
<p>職是之故，今欲解決上海燃料問題，根本之圖，自任增供給平水腳，此固小二法門，供給多，成本輕，其價不平而自平。然供給之增，不得不望華北煤產之有大量接濟，但能吾如願，殊難逆料，水脚减低，責在航業，但航業以爲不僅受戰事影響，水脚暴漲，亦爲煤價貴而水脚難减，故煤價能低，則水脚自落，煤業則以水脚貴而煤本難輕，惟水脚减而煤價自平。先鷄先卵，無從決之，要之皆爲私利計耳，雖然，若不就根本先平煤價，而以目前煤球平賣，爲可解決燃料問題之困難，去題尙遠。即如每人　角四斤之煤球平沽，充其量，一千担而已，藉曰有惠可沾，不過二萬五千人；空籃而返者，每日恒有四五萬人，惟有此點綴，以安民心，亦足多也。</p>
<p>燃料問題一日不解決，則其影響所及，固不僅家用燃料爲難，小之，如熟水業之用煤問題，允爲可慮，若竟因缺乏燃料，而被迫停業或出於加價，所予居戶以不便及貧民之困苦者至深且鉅。大之，煤爲機器之食糧，若因缺煤而停止運動，則連帶必引起職工失業問題，此其間接所致之影響，又較任何問題爲嚴重。廠家有擬用白煤或柴油以資代替者，惟其價格相差無多，且非將鍋爐改裝，則火力不易發揮，故一時尙難分烟煤之恐慌。因之煤斤問題，今除增加船隻，减輕水脚，以暢來源，而低成本之外，別無他途。至欲求存煤充積，以期供求調勻，不虞竭蹶，歸於平準，則目前煤價昂貴若是，吃本太重，恐非煤業一業之力所能負荷。惟有由各業各自爲謀，籌資定貨，儲供自用，雖手續較繁，耗費較巨，無求諸煤業之利便，然事出不得已，固亦無可如何之舉也。</p>
<p>電亦爲都市重要燃料之一（燈力熱）。自煤貴，電費亦屢增附加費，近且加至百分之一百十四有奇，照原價加一倍以上矣。夫電力公司用煤，本向礦商購來，訂有長期合同，爲其直接供消費，定價較廉，故其成本自非一般工廠用煤所可相提並論。今電力公司購煤合同，尙未滿期，而爲未雨綢繆計已一再增收附加費，若一旦期滿改訂，其煤價亦照市比例增加，則電費附加又不知增至如何地步。電氣爲公川事業，故許其獨占，則其營業方針，自未可與一般工商業徒以營利爲目的者比，雖其增費，亦出於不得已，日照例須取得工部局公用事業委員會之同意，但旣加重用戶之負担，要宜與用戶以共知共見，俾皆恍然於其因何而加之何以必須增加若許成數之事由所在，而無間言。吾則人將目電力公司與一般唯利是圖之普通商儈同，是豈公用事業之本意哉！茲因論及燃料問題而願爲電力公司進一言馬。</p>

<p>倫敦　此間外交界人士頃證實芬蘭國代表業巳到達莫斯科、將與蘇聯當局磋商議和條件、即蘇聯經出瑞典國所提出者、芬蘭國政府雖認爲未便接受、但因不易獲得英法兩國援助之故、不得已決定與蘇聯進行談判、至以軍事形勢而論、尙未至絕望地步、是以芬國代表團所負使命、乃以談判爲限、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>芬京　芬蘭非官塲方面對於所傳蘇聯經瑞典居間向芬蘭提出之和平條件、多表示驚愕、並以爲瑞典對於所傳各條件、竟允担任調停、殊堪驚異、芬蘭之知此項條件、係得諸瑞典京城所載之紐約新聞電訊、芬蘭政府頃發表文吿、謂此項條件聞較去秋所提出者、更爲範圍廣泛、惟內容迄今尙未知悉、外交界方面對此項條件、頗多討論、據稱一方面芬蘭政府頗注意於瑞典之調停而另一方面則須知芬蘭民意將不容根據此項條件進行談判、蓋認蘇聯經數月戰爭之努力、並未獲得多大勝利、殊不應作有損國家獨立之讓步、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>柏林　今日德外部發言人接見外國新聞記者時、有詢其蘇芬兩國代表在瑞典京城之談判、是否由德國促成之、答曰、德國對蘇芬衝突所取之態度、今昔相同、自蘇芬戰事發生後、從未變更、余本人不知此事、是以關於瑞京和平談判之事、不能解答、或曰、然則君能否認外間傳說德國與聞此事乎、答曰、余亦不能否認之、因余本人對此事一無所知、（八日海通電）</p>
<p>荷京　瑞典國出面調處芬蘭蘇聯兩國戰事之說、頃由瑞京消息予以證實、該國政界人士雖拒不透露任何消息、以免妨害談判之進行、但亦承認蘇聯政府所提條件、較之芬蘇戰前所提出者、範圍尤爲廣大、此外、瑞典國衆議院外交委員會在最近數日間逐日舉行會議、至有無芬蘭國代表列席、則尙不可知、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>維堡四週戰事劇烈</p>
<p>芬京　蘇軍企圖在芬蘭梅灣越氷前進、致起激戰、聞維堡四週林中、積屍纍纍、據各方消息、蘇軍進攻血戰之烈、爲前所未見、但聞蘇軍已暫爲芬軍機關槍火與芬機之猛烈轟炸所遏阻、蘇軍進攻時、集合大批坦克車與裝甲汽車越氷前進、致成芬方砲隊與飛機萬無一失之轟炸目標、在此可怖之惡戰中、蘇兵仍能前進者爲數殊寥寥也、據芬軍偵察隊報吿、蘇方刻正大規模重行分配其軍隊、芬方謂此乃蘇方低估其將在維堡遭遇之抵抗力所致、芬方最近戰報稱、喀萊里亞地頸西部蘇軍猛攻維堡灣西北部海岸刻正在維堡灣口作戰、爭奪該區各島嶼越氷前進之蘇軍遭芬方砲擊、巴受重創、毀坦克車逾三十輛、維堡灣與伏斯巨間之芬軍擊退蘇軍之局部進攻、毀坦克車十七輛、戴貝爾地方、蘇方於砲轟後派兵進攻、但被擊退、拉多加湖北面蘇軍在畢卡蘭達及羣島攻擊、已佔芬軍所守之數島嶼又芬蘭空軍轟炸芬蘭灣與維堡灣氷上之蘇軍、（八日路透社電）</p>

<p>芬局已到決定階段</p>
<p>荷京　倫教方面對於蘇芬戰事之調停消息、異常興奮、一般人之印象、均以爲芬蘭問題、業已到達決定之階段矣、雖英國官方人士、保持緘默態度、避不發表評論、但政界人士、顯然憂慮調停成功後、協約國之威信、將遭遇嚴重之損失、據倫敦方面宣稱、英法兩國、於最近數日內或將有所決定、倘不干涉芬蘭問題、則鼓勵芬蘭抗戰之努力、行將减少矣、英國以爲瑞典以壓力加於芬蘭、使接受蘇聯要求、故甚爲憤怒、但一般人相信挪威將反對蘇聯之領土要求、而傾向於支持協約國之援芬計劃、（八日海通電）</p>
<p>中國希望蘇芬息爭</p>

<h3>禁令變更情形</h3>
<p>本埠某國貨團體、昨接星嘉坡中國國貨公司經理李曉嚴君來函報告關於星嘉坡方面、最近對於外貨（指非金磅國家之貨）輸入、又有變更情形、頗爲詊盡、爰節錄如下、原函略謂、查國貨輸入星嘉坡自經當地政府第二次頒布統制法令、分限制與禁止兩種後、申請入口准許、頗非易事、禁止貨物、在去年底已公告停止申請、茲於本月十九日、又公告限制貨品內有卅種、</p>
<p>暫停入口</p>
<p>申請云、「（一）關於下列之限制入口貨品（並錄其在憲報通告所列之號數與說明）之定單（簡稱AP式、即限制貨品聲請書、）此種請求、轉接頭決不接受、（二）此種措置之原因、乃係鑒於業於一九三九年十一月十八日定貨之CP式（即禁止貨品申請書）定單、或該口以後請求核准關於經已交出及照准之AP式定單之申請、爲數甚多、至於從香港入口織造品之定單之前申請、其適當期爲一九三九年十二月二十八日、（三）已悉有數種申請、其定單嗣後被取消、或則依照AP式准證之眞實定單、因若干理由而不被核准、連同與有關係之AL式或CL式抄本、從速報告入口貨統制署、藉資參考、將來對於入口商實有極大之補助、（四）若有對於特種入口商、確有困難之事、則對於上述之規定、有求</p>
<p>免受限制</p>
<p>之建議、當予以考慮、取決之標準、往往視所交之CL式及AP式之申請人、陳述其在一九三八年間四個月以內平均入口之特種貨品之數字如何、又該項物品、自一九三九年十二月一日來、爲申請人所輸入之數、是否不超過一九三八年之相當期間平均入口數目、此等建議、將於一九四〇年三月一日、或該日以後、加以討論、同時須附有所稱之數字證據、（五）茲指出曾經要求或定購限制入口貨物表之其餘幾乎全部貨品之定單、（指卅種以外四十六種貨品）爲數衆多、對於此等貨品、擬亦取酌量採取同樣停止AP式定單之申請辦法也云云、惟據限制輸入統制官解釋謂限制入口貨表內之貨物、將來可以繼續輸入馬來亞、但須俟目前高積之定單被吸收、按比例减至馬來亞經常所需之量時、始再准許、故吾滬上各廠商、仍當努力於出品之精良、以期暢銷、毋須灰心等語」、（下略又目前暫停申請入口）</p>
<p>貨品名目</p>
<p>詳載如左、（一）其他製造榖類、（二）其他肉類、（三）罐頭頭沙甸魚、（四）乾水果及保存水果、（五）洋葱、（六）白蘭地、（七）燒酒、（外國製造）（八）蒸酒、（包括藥酒）其標準酒精、不超過廿六巴仙者、（九）凹瓷器、（如烹調及家庭用具）（十）馬口鐵片、（十一）銅及銅器、（十二）手電筒、電池、（十三）灰色未標白布收疋頭、（十四）漂白布疋頭、（十五）染色疋頭、（十六）印花布疋頭、（包括紡造紗籠）（十七）布疋頭織花有色布、（十八）棉布紗籠（十九）人造絲疋頭、（二十）人造絲紗籠、（二一）皮鞋及皮靴、（二二）布及人造絲外大衣、（二三）人造絲內衣、（二四）布內衣、（二五）其他種類之印刷紙、（二六）其他紙料及紙製造物、（二七）自由車附件、（二八）火箭及其他烟火產品、（二九）線香及冥鏹、（三十）其他種類之化妝香品、</p>

<h3>理敎會敦勸　戒除烟酒嫖賭　一經沉湎莫不耗財傷身　亟應振奮服務社會國家</h3>
<p>上海市理敎會為敦勸戒除烟酒嫖賭、振奮精神、服務社會國家、特發表告市民書云、各界市民們、際此百物勝貴生活程度高漲之今日、欲應付非常支出、莫說貧苦市民、感到困難、即中上階級、也常感捉襟見肘、故欲渡此難關、惟有勵行節約、降低物質享受、節省不必要之消費、「烟酒嫖賭」、為消費品中爲害最烈者、茲分述於後、</p>
<p>烟</p>
<p>中含有尼古丁毒質、久吸能　破壞腦神經組織、影響身體健康、此猶指捲烟之類而言、他若雅片·嗎啡·白面·海洛因等、其毒性尤爲猛烈、少吸固能振奮精神、然一經上癮、即不易戒除、沉湎其中、百事俱廢、終茶骨瘦如柴、精神萎頓、形如蹺鬼、被人不齒、</p>
<p>酒</p>
<p>之害雖不若烟之爲烈、然久飲亦能使神經衰弱、因酒而闖禍者、比比皆是、因酒而誤事者、亦時有所聞、且酒價受物價影響、遞增不已、名貴之酒、原料多屬洋貨、每年漏卮、達數千萬元、就戰時經濟而言、尙爲國家重大損失、</p>
<p>嫖</p>
<p>之為害、講人皆知、試觀常涉足花業者、因精力虧損過甚而喪身者、數見不鮮、至糜費金錢、猶爲餘事、値此抗戰建國之時、應一致振奮、爲國效勞、何忍迷戀於聲色之中、</p>
<p>賭</p>
<p>每日翻開報紙、常見無數自殺新聞、其自殺原因、則大多起於賭負而受經濟壓迫、良以睹博一事、小則廢時耗財、大則傾家蕩產、雖有時逢塲作戲、然世人往往一入此途、即如墮進陷阱、昕日不輟、冀圖僥倖、於是無心操作、有業者棄業、棄業後甘習下流、實堪痛心、由是觀之、可知烟酒嫖賭、實爲我人當前之大敵、務望染有此癖者、初减少其分量與次數、進而澈底戒絕、不僅個人前途之幸福、抑亦国家民族前途之曙光也、</p>

<p>開始打撈</p>
<p>景昇輪自　覆後、沉輪因受湍潮衝激、已漂流至鎭海三江口北平會館門首江底、由滬僱往之潛水伕十名、業已搭駁輪抵甬、開始測騐打撈沉輪、惟該地水深達二十餘丈、且因江底淤泥侵入、該輪艙位共有三層、船身吃重故一時尙無起出水面之希望、</p>
<p>辦理善後</p>
<p>寗波各界組織之善後委員會、自開始辦公以來、工作極爲緊張、該會現已將所有撈獲屍體、移置於新爲路四明公所、以待認領、並定每日下午二時至四時間、辦理待領遺物事宜、滬甬各界捐助救濟款項者、亦頗踴躍、昨續收到和豐紗廠等捐款一萬元、辦理善後、</p>

<h3>工部局本年度預算　衛生處　甲·臨時支出門</h3>

<p>各項經常費開支中增加最多者、厥爲華人隔離醫院之經費、計增四一三·八〇〇元、嗣經衛生處長決定將華人隔離醫院新閘</p>
<p>本年經常費所以增加之原因、不外由於增發職員臨時生活費津貼以及各項應川品與水電各費之漲價所致、此外本年預計並無額外收入、如售米盈餘之局方對於前項補助金之撥發、當盡力促其用於公衆健康方面最有效之途、</p>
<p>以上各項預算、業經衛生委員查經常支出門預算草案原列二·七八二·二五〇元、比上年多列八九三·六〇〇元、茲分列比較如下、路分院暫行停止、个面極力、减縮其他開支多項之後、上項經常費預算總數改爲二·四二三·二六〇元、茲分列比較如下、撥款等等亦爲其原因之一，補助金此項補助金依照慣例常列於預算書之「衛生組」項下、本年應撥之數額、目前尙不能確定、下列各項、係屬試列性質會於二月十六日開會通過、除必要時、仍得山財務衛生兩處長會同調整外、准提交財務委員會審查、</p>

<h3>津幫一再傾吐　金市重入疲途</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、復進入疲境、雖中途香港帮買進共有四五白兩之夥、奈天津帮一再拋售、兼有散戶多頭因吃息太重、無利可圖、故續有限價賣出、致結果反吿跌落、晨開即撳小十五元、爲四千七百八十元、嗣有某金號代港帮拖進、而證券帮亦有搜入、遂一度回升至四千七百九十元、某錢兌業復代津帮猛塞、加之某銀號亦來求售、且期時滙市略形帶硬、故曾壓低至四千七百六十元、後以外滙轉定、賣風稍殺、港帮乘機再撈、故迄午收遂回至四千七百七十四元、午後交易平淡、情勢稍穩、結果提起二元、爲四千七百七十六元收盤、比上日軋小十　元、全大交易約有千七八百兩、銀樓飾金呆定、海關金等仍平、</p>

<h3>證券　內債洋股　交易均稀　公和祥通告派息</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况、仍在沉悶過程中、多空雙方各有了結及掉換種類交易、新交易甚少成交、大戶雖有出籠、市價並不因之而小、因隨時有乘機補空者、多方盼借款成立而堅定、空方恐南京謠言之實現而不補、互相擯持、乃愈覺呆定、昨日上午賣出、以信孚爲多、三十八號次之、餘則零星散戶、買方同康收乙種、大豐公茂收甲種、久豐略有收回、鴻康泰康及聯益均有需要、市價略疲、午後久豐·大豐轉入爲出、三十八號轉出爲入、同康繼續收乙、聯益繼續收進鼎康亦有進胃、市價乃略轉堅穩、結果高低互見、仍祇五分一角而已、成交總數約四十餘萬儿、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<p>昨日衆業公所股市、交易稀少、但星期四日所啟展之穩定趨勢、迄未動搖、公衆對於鋼業·怡和·上海銀公司及揚子銀公司等股雖感興趣、對於價格未能有所增益、生橡皮之價、近日幾無變動、故橡皮股市、亦吿黯淡、</p>
<p>頃據港方傳來消息、謂港政府擬對公司利得、徵收稅項、此殆亦爲市塲暫時未克安定之一因、但按諸實際、此種措施、對於本市各外商公司之依照中國公司法營業者、（雖此等公司中大都有在香港註册者）並不　甲、或令商人方面有此負擔、</p>

<h3>紗花　多空觀望　紗市盤旋</h3>
<p>紗市平靜、不脫盤旋之局惟多空兩方皆持觀望態度、但實際華南方面、雖無大量交易、然零星採辦、尙不間斷、所以市象安定、惟有一部份因其底盤較高、心氣淡泊、但原料依然堅挺、而不能鬆懈也、三月份二十支雙馬價爲九百十三元收盤、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、人氣會緊、二十支雙馬三月期價為九白十四元、此價一開、買者未旺、搶帽子之流、反見賣出、市盤山昂轉鬆而下至九百〇七元、旋聞外匯寗靜、無大變遷、又復回升至九百十二元、查半日間成交統計一千六百二十五包、行情二十支雙馬現貨跌三元、廠方由新裕廠開出二十支雙地球一千二百包、價爲八百二十元現鈔、又今日有紗十五件運香港、茲將各帮買去之額量分列如下、</p>

<p>本棉喊價日高</p>
<p>本棉交易、仍以同行互相買賣爲夥、均係火機單包白包兩種棉花、成交爲多、但廠方需要未見起色、人心挺秀異常、實緣貨物大稀之故也、所以售價已日增進、北路太倉花已做到二百〇七元、尙係棧房交貨、通州花賣者尤缺、叫價殊昂、蘇北來源未見、茲將現棉成交情形列左、</p>
<p>通州花二〇九·〇〇　同行進一〇〇包</p>

<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日晨初即形穩定、先因投機者之購買、後因同業之購買而又挺秀、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲起四五磅音、印度昨日連同預測又漲二羅比、埃及棉市又漲十餘磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來頗形活躍、但俱為同業間之交易、連日因市上現貨幾被搜購一空、故昨日同業已開始訂購印棉、計成交約有千餘包之數、廠方則始終靜寂、茲將昨日棉市以美匯六元七五折合送廠價如下、</p>

<h3>糧食　洋米大批湧到　米糧囤戶　勢難堅守</h3>
<p>連日暴跌之米市、自前午一度回緊後、昨則人心向背、忽又不同、願脫與否、各有其人、市價成定或降、亦不一致、初開原根客販、持貨觀機、不肯鬆脫、而作客方面、若一號西貢、晨問猶多問津、所以當時一號西買形勢頗見平穩、且直至收盤、未有上落、不過對於他貨、如火絞小絞等、則納胃復呆鮮見做開、於是浮囤散戶、心思又餒、再度跌價、一時火絞衹售四十三元半至四十三元、小絞售四十元、次僅三十九元、東京次砶尖三十九元半至三十九元三角、較前收盤、價回落半元至一元光景、　此後市面、即一路徘徊、以迄收市、未見變化、至於混合碎尖所有市貨、爲應平糶所需、市上出售者、本屬有限、而店舖門市爲大衆平民之歡迎、又須應付零沽、故銷塲特旺、昨反能獨秀三五角、計開三十五元半至三十五元、糯米續在疲頹之中、繼落半元左右、厚薄粳及早晚稻塲外暗盤、未聞售開、</p>
<p>洋米國外定價雖已劃小、然以滬市連朝瀉跌後、人心虛軟、定價雖能通劃、而行國客戶均不敢續定、良以前定各批正在絡繹抵埠、昨續到一船待卸外、尙有一二船亦將接踵進口、偌大數量與鉅額銀根、殊足以搖動大戶客圍之堅守性、而浮散戶尤爲惶恐、昨日現貨尙有客鄉舖作趁小略辦、而回籠期貨仍乏暢化、貨方雖竭力擯持、而結果終各續削四五角六七角不等、現洋米開出四五千包，期貨祗併計三百多噸、二號暹邏五十元、二號西貢五十元〇八角至五十元〇五角、混合碎四十二元二角半外佣、小絞午後還價四十八元半未妥、</p>
<p>昨日又到大批洋米、係渣華公司經理之薩佛羅托Sawah　Loento（譯音）號、山仰光儎米來滬、昨日上午八時許進口、計裝來四千五百噸、合約四萬五千餘包、停靠浦東藍烟囱碼頭起卸、又奧別林Ombi　lin（譯音）號、亦渣華公司經理、係由西貢裝米來滬、定今午進口、預定停靠公和祥碼頭、該輪裝來之洋米、有七萬一千餘包之鉅、該項洋米、聞係建源公司所經辦、</p>
<h3>粉麥步降</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨市步趨下游、本街在平賣期間、當然需要小旺、雖有內地及鄉莊之點綴、爲數亦有限、客銷以禁止出口、人心萎頓、祗以原料成本高貴、及回籠貨籌碼有限、卒難一路在跌、昨日上午交易寥寥、後市始稍做開祇老車牌一種、價由十四元三角半鬆至十四元三角、衹零星小數交易而已、</p>
<p>小麥昨　昨日麥市、已見步挫、蓋因各廠前定之洋麥、大部份於本月內到滬、因此浮囤觀望、華廠進胃亦呆、聞南洋帮及日廠稍有取辦、計開常熟麥二十三元三角、蘇州麥二十三元八角、成交五百包、比前價又小數角云、</p>
<p>進口　昨有生油一千六百件、豆油一百件黃豆四百四十八包、均由烟臺運到、</p>
<p>出口　今日有豆子六百五十包、運杳港、又米一千包運天津</p>
<h3>南北貨　黑瓜子漲勢愈勁</h3>
<p>黑瓜子近以南洋帮動辦、又値來源寥寥、上漲愈甚、濟魁喊至九十元、高徐魁子亦近八十元、大連子六十元、有存貨者未肯即脫、誠爲近年來僅見之新高價也、</p>
<h3>糖市　興化片青漲二元</h3>
<p>昨糖市據荷蘭電訊、照Ｃ.Ｉ.Ｆ　Ｋ．Ｇ．例爲荷盾九·五五、比前又小荷盾一角、公會劃盤趨勢平平、現貨二四粗白無上落、木棧六十二元半、外棧新到六十二元三角至二角、老貨六十二元至六十一元九角、轉口四十九元、太古車白微緊、好起二三角、西棧Ｂ嘜六十七元、ＣＷ嘜六十六元半、ＣＸ嘜六十五元、ＤＹ嘜六十四元二角、ＨＸ嘜六十三元七角、東棧貨照退、其餘均乏軒輊、國較有與化帮開出片靑二百響、價爲四十二元二角、（鈔）比前升度近二元、</p>
<h3>絲茶　印菲絲銷　仍難開展</h3>
<p>昨日絲市、日美同吿回升、紐約三月份漲一角二分半、遠期漲九分半、橫濱現貨漲四十元、遠期漲二十七元、本埠絲市因鑒於　來絲價呆疲、故昨市回蘇、外銷售意即呈濃厚、是故達昌·仁記·連納各有成交、白廠七十五分售開六十担、價五零五零元、八三分前日發電交易做開十担、價五一零零元、久寂之絲市、因之頗見活絡、印菲絲銷、仍難開展、蓋整個絲市、趨向仍水能立轉上升也、九日有茶葉運天津四千件、</p>
<h3>煤炭　海峯煤堅挺　超過火爐白煤</h3>
<p>海峯白煤、最近交易、尙不寂寞、乃緣舊存有限、新貨無到、在此靑黃不接之時、售方心思頗堅、不願貶價、故市態堅挺、超過火爐白煤、計開海峯大塊每噸一百八十元、篩塊一百匕十元、統煤每噸百六十元、送到客戶、酌加行扛、</p>
<h3>呢絨單面花呢　仍極流行</h3>
<p>昨星期五、毛貨呢絨市仍俏漲、各貨齊有供不敷求之概、單面花呢、今仍極風行、中西裝衣着、莫不盛行指選、因其牢固堅厚而耐穿、致銷路大暢、惜英製品到缺價貴、申地日商廠家紡織者、爲原料高貴、多相率早巳停止、市貨因之大缺、標準行情昨英製頭號單面花呢每碼現批售三十三元、二號二十八元、申地紡織者普通悉售十五六元、東貨頭號售十九元、</p>

<h3>翠娥傳</h3>
<p>吉生如愚，山左人，故世家裔，幼涉經史，性曠放，東海公宰靖江，聘焉。邑東舊有崇聖寺，香火甚盛，仕女瞻拜如雲，吉生遊春之暇，信步以觀。有一垂髻女郎，容華絕世，綽約如仙，生迷惑依戀，幾於忘返。會生有友周君，與女郎比鄰，生遂時時顧從，蓋欲得隴圖蜀也。周知其隱，戲曰：「咫尺紅牆，令人盼煞矣，然蹇修固有人在。」生驚疑曰：「鮑叔誠知我，然無半面之識，尺素之通，成豈易易。」周曰：「女家以壓綫爲業久矣，求售者紛來，隱寓標士意，吾稔之有素，如與君偕訪，僞為購女紅可也。」生然之。翌日偕往，晤一垂白老嫗，蓋女之母也。女名翠娥，年十八，稍解韻語，而性執志高，非梁鴻不適。生乘閒挑之，嫗與女之意皆相屬。乃生父教綦嚴，王謝門高，難許侯氏。然竊喜大台有路，積漸往來。某日，嫗娣壽，往慶於鄕，牛故偵之確，逕達娥舍，時則娥方倦繡花下踟蹰，舉目見生，訝其突至。生前揖而言曰：「囊勞酬箋，彌憎綿結，區區私誠，倘能妝閣爲奴，死且無憾！」娥俛首靦覜，半推半就。未幾，居停遷龍山，力邀生往。生逡巡木決，謀於娥，娥曰：「君勿以兒女之私，使妾負罪。」越數日，生冉詣女家，聞嫗哭甚哀，入則見娥已自經死矣。</p>

<h3>蘇聯的新聞事業</h3>
<p>— 新虛</p>
<p>「新聞不僅是集體的宣傳家和煽動家，同時是集體的組織者。」這是蘇聯新聞的特點。全國所有的新聞，都在黨政機關和職工會監督之下管理，沒有任何私人的言論機關，這是與世界各國的新聞界完全不同的。蘇聯民間還有一種「工業通訊社」，與各種新聞直接發生連擊，除對國家建設事業有莫大的幫助之外，關於認識全國人民的現實生活這一點上，也有深切的意義。所以蘇聯認爲新聞事業是國家一個重要的機構。</p>
<p>依新聞出版的地域而言，有全聯邦新聞，共和國新聞，州及地方新聞，和管理區新聞四種。依社會的性質而言，有一般的政治新聞，工業新聞，農業新聞，職工會新聞，共產黨新聞，青年共產主義同盟新聞，少年先鋒隊新聞，婦女新聞以及工廠新聞等等。</p>
<p>在形態方面有日刊，二月刊，半週刊，週刊，旬刊，半月刊，月刊，季刊，年刊等。頁數大槪都是四頁。蘇聯主要的新聞刊物，如下：</p>
<p>（一）真理報，是蘇聯聯邦的新聞，每日發行份數，現已超過四百萬份，它是聯邦共產黨的機關報，創刊於一九一二年五月五日，是蘇聯唯一的最古之新聞。其主筆爲莫洛托夫。現在這真理報創刊的日子，已被定爲蘇聯的「出版日」。</p>
<p>（二）消息報，是蘇聯政府的機關報，每日發行二百五十萬份，創刊於一九一七年二月十八日，其主筆爲報界權威布哈林氏。</p>
<p>（三）工業化，發行總數每日有八十萬份，以五年計劃爲目標的工業化運動的指導新聞，是重工業人民委員會的機關報。</p>
<p>（四）經濟生活，是計劃經濟的總本部哥斯普浪及財務人民委員會的共同機關報，每日發行二十萬份。</p>
<p>（五）農民新聞，爲指導農業經濟及集體農場之發展的新聞，直屬於黨中央委員會，每三日發行一次，約三百萬份以上。</p>
<p>（六）赤星，是革命軍事委員會的機關報，每日發行四十餘萬份，是聯邦國防最高機關的刊物。</p>
<p>（七）少共真理報，是蘇俄青年共產主義同盟的機關報，每日發行總數在一百萬份以上。不過，蘇俄的任何新聞，篇幅是很少的，即如每日發行四百萬份的真理報，也只有像普通報紙差不多大小的一張而已。原因是在蘇聯沒有商業上的競爭，商業廣告是不必要的，一張報紙的篇幅，足夠登載國內外各種重要的新聞了。</p>

<h3>兒童的哭</h3>
<p>— 錦帆</p>
<p>我們不能否認：「兒童的哭是一種不高興，不歡樂，不舒適的表示；它是笑的反面。」然而這未免太狹義了；人類是萬物之靈，所以他較旁的動物有計劃，有做作，兒童受了父母遺傳的關係，所以他在很小的時候，就懂得做作，虛偽，甚至欺騙，要挾；雖然他們不知道這些名目，然而他們的確是很會運用這些技巧；他們的唯一手段便是「哭」。</p>
<p>哭的確使許多父母們感到棘手。他們看着自己的愛兒流着淚，不斷地哭聲，煩惱着他們，是憐惜和憤怒交感在他們心裏，於是耐性的父母便百般依順他們的孩子，不耐性的父母便動手打他們的孩子，然而這些都不是應付兒童哭的好方法。</p>
<p>我們先來說「依順」的壞處吧！譬如說你的孩子要糖吃，你沒有答應他，於是他大聲的哭，哭得不停，這時候你被他哭得討厭，一方面又可憐他而依順了他，於是你的孩子得到勝利了，並且他明白這勝利是從「哭」得來的，他像得到了一個啟示，哭會使一切如願以償，此後他便時常會用哭來要挾你了。</p>
<p>至於「打」呢，在教育上我們早已公認「體罰」不是教育兒童的好方法，它往往使兒童忽略體罰的原因，而在他們心裏起了一種變態的憎恨，久之，這憎恨便在他心裏伏下根蒂。我們時常看見一個兒童憎恨他的父親，就是因了這緣故。普通男子總不及女子的對兒童來的溫柔體貼，如果說用「打」來醫治兒童的哭，或許會得到一些效果，然而這並不是真正的效果，牠使你的孩子離開你，牠使你的孩子怕你，於是父母和孩子間像有一道無形的牆相隔起來。我們說兒童是家庭間快樂的天使，是父母的安慰者，當孩子們失掉了活潑天真的姿態時，試想這個家庭間還有什麽生趣可談呢？</p>
<p>那麼，我們到底怎樣來應付兒童的哭呢？陳　琴先生說：「要同情兒童」，「要做兒童伴侶」。這二句從經騐中得來的兒童教育原理，也就是應付兒童哭的唯一方法了。做父母的不要一味依着自己的意思來「命令」兒童，因爲「兒童並不是小規模的成人」。一切心理生理他完全異於成人，成人要明瞭這一點，設身處地的觀察兒童，尋求兒童某一次哭的緣故，明白他們的欲望，需要，同情他們，同情會使兒童信仰你，親近你，這樣你又可以伴侶的地位，循兒童的年齡和程度來勸解，指導，多說譬喻，兒童又好模仿，你可以做好的樣子，這才使應付兒童哭的合理方法。並且能收到很好效果的。</p>

<h3>流過血的地方</h3>
<p>— 馬竹君</p>
<p>一天，我在霞飛路等電車。</p>
<p>我的周圍充滿了人聲，汽車聲電車的鈴聲，報販的叫聲，一切都市的聲音。</p>
<p>我看見數不清楚的人羣，就像一條長的人海。女人披了漂亮的皮大衣，男人梳光了頭髮。我又看見許多大肚皮的巨商富紳，口里啣着雪茄，年紅燈照着他們的禿腦袋，照着他們懷里的女人，照着他們得意的笑臉。我也看見那許多小販，他們背着生活的重担，含着哀求的眼光去看行人，口里吐出那慘痛的叫聲。</p>
<p>忽然一個哀叫的聲音抓住了我。就在那酒館的門前，一個西裝青年正用力擊倒了一個黃包車夫，我知道哪哀叫就是從倒在地下那人的口里發出來的。他哭着，從地上爬起來，想去拉那青年的大衣，但一個有力地拳頭接連地落在他的鼻上。血從那人的鼻子里噴出來，淌了一手，染紅了衣襟，他恐惶地哭着，叫着，想拉住那青年。但沒有用，那青年一面用力擊他的頭，一面用手去推開酒館的玻璃門窗。</p>
<p>黃包車夫被漂亮的皮鞋踢着又被擊倒了，青年昂然地走進了酒館。黃包車夫跟着要進去，里面的僕役却抵住門，對他做着可怕的白眼，黃包車夫在外面哭着叫着，周圍站了許多人，人叫他去報告巡捕，他一面抹着那髙腫的鼻子，拭去那從不間斷湧出來的紅血，踉蹌地一路走着。巡捕來了，許多人吐了一口氣。巡捕進了酒館，黃包車夫無力地在外面拭着鮮血，人叫他仰起頭，這樣可以止血。巡捕出來了無助地望着黃包車夫。人羣里響着幾句不平的話語，巡捕又走了進去。人開始不滿意起來。玻璃門窗又推開了。一個肥胖的僕役露出了一個圓臉，堆着虛偽的笑容，他的手正對着那車夫幌着一張一角的新鈔票，但許多不滿的聲音把那圓臉趕了進去。</p>
<p>巡捕出來了依舊一個人，對車夫說了幾句話，獨自走了。人開始議論着，有的嚷着不公平，有的狠狠地吐着口沫，有的漲紅了面孔，但也有些人移動着腳步走開了。瘦小的黃包車夫靠在樹幹上，口里發出些微的呻吟用手去整理那高腫的鼻子，用手去撫摩身上的創痛，用衣袖去拭那從沒有間斷流下來的紅血。</p>
<p>我忘記了一部一部駛過去的電車，我聽着那生活掙扎的呻吟，我的眼淚湧在眼前。另一個黃包車夫朝我看了一眼，問我要不要車子，我恐怖地起了一陣戰抖，茫然地看了他一眼，便離開了年紅燈照耀着一塊流過血的地方。</p>
<p>我的耳前響着一片生活高壓下的呻吟，我的眼前看見無數個不幸的人們，他們爲要使生活過得優裕一點，便會被擊着，被踢着，甚至於流血。一路許多黃包車夫向我兜攬生意我搖着頭。我不是那些昂然地青年，爲了使自己的生活優裕一點，我也能够去毆擊別人，甚至於使人流血嗎？</p>
<p>都市的聲音，我再也不能够聽這掙扎的呻吟了。（却酬）</p>

<h3>沒有春天</h3>
<p>— 王韜</p>
<p>日曆告訴我，是已經春天了。但是我却絲毫沒有聽到任何春天的消息，也沒有感覺到春天的溫暖。我依然像生活在嚴冬那寒冷的冰窖裏。…………</p>
<p>斗室內陣陣吹進寒風，窗外紛飛着的是一片迷茫的春雪。一股陰涼的感情緊壓着我的心，我漸漸的感到生活的窒息</p>
<p>我開始沉浸在痛苦的思索裏。於是我想起了一個故事，一個關於巨人底故事。</p>
<p>……巨人因爲自私，他不允許任何兒童在他花園裏玩耍，因此他的花園始終被嚴冬佔領着。雖然外邊已經更換了幾個季節，但是他的花園依然是飛舞的雪花，狂吼着的北風，樹枝也赤條着身體。……這裏是祗有嚴冬，沒有春天。</p>
<p>我又想起了現在生活着的這個「孤島」。……</p>
<p>生活的指數無盡止的往上爬，囤積操縱，成了一時風氣。路屍餓莩成千的垂死在米店門口，雖然門口裏堆滿了他們日夜企求而無法得到的百米！</p>
<p>「孤島」上邊還有沒有春天呢？讓千萬快要垂死的人們來溫暖一下冰冷的心胸，讓千萬快要窒息的人們來呼吸一下新鮮的空氣。</p>
<p>然而，「孤島」上是沒有春天。這裏是一個冰凍的荒島，一個多麼可怕的荒島呵。</p>
<p>但是，我們是多麼熱烈的企望着春天的消息啊！然而，「孤島」沒有春天。……</p>

<h3>聽的藝術　（一）</h3>
<p>在鐵路的交叉點，總豎的有一個牌子，上面寫着說，「止步，留心看，注意聽。」這雖寥寥幾個字，但寫在這裏，是非常要緊的，因爲這樣一來，可以預防意外事件發生，並救護人的生命，使不遭無妄之災。我們從這裏可以想到人的這兩種本能—看和聽，於他本人的關係，是何等重大。運用得當，可使他生活優秀而向上，運用不得當，可招致許多災害，甚至于死亡。前幾個禮拜。我們已經講到人應當怎樣「看，」今天再提出這「聽」的本能來討論，請大家注意。有一天，有幾個人帶了一個又聾又結舌的人來見耶穌，他們知道耶穌是著名的醫生，所以特來求耶穌給那人治病。耶穌從衆人中。把那人叫了開來，用手指捺在他的耳上，用涎液吐在他的舌上，仰天深深嘆息，然後說，「開」，於是那人的耳朶果然開了，舌頭也能自由說話。但那人從此却負起了一種重大責任！耶穌明白這一點，所以在醫治他的病之先，深深的仰天嘆息。我們平常的人，也是這樣，我們使人能說能聽，同時，我們即使他負了兩大責任。他的前途是黑暗，是光明，全看他能否知道運用他這兩種本能，「聽」和「看」。原來「聽」是一種的藝術，人人應當加意修養。我們有一雙耳朶，除聾子外都能聽事，這是本能的聽。耶穌的意思，因爲人不但會聽就够，還得要知道怎樣的「聽」纔行。他說，「凡有耳的，就應當聽。」他的意思，就是教人照着基督的樣子聽事。平日各方面的聲音，如哭，叫，吵鬧，談話，音樂，等等，人人不費力可以聽清，即如今天禮拜所講的道理，你們也都能聽着，但是這個題目，是從耶穌說的話，脫胎而來，耶穌說這話，是什麽意思，也許你們未曾聽着呢。我們聽，不在聽表面的聲音，我們要能明白言外之意，這是最要緊的。（待續）如欲詳細詢問研究請函郵箱一二二七號</p>

<h3>李春來與春桂園</h3>
<p>— 錫森</p>
<p>前日本攔徐慕雲君梨園外紀，述楊小樓崇拜李春來事，足見春來於南方武生中，可當首席而無媿。顧春來尚有一事足述者，即當時與滬妓朱桂珍創設春桂園，美輪美奐，聞後日戲院建築宏偉風氣之先，則知者較鮮，茲摭述之：</p>
<p>先是，有吳門朱桂珍校書者，營香巢於三馬路之公羊里，性狂傲，與客落落寡合，一日，作西裝遊於張氏味蒓園，織腰一握，娟娜如臨風之柳，有京卿黃某，見而艶之，即夕召使侑觴，風流業緣，遂賦定情，未逾月，界其母以十斛明珠，百兩迎歸，置諸金釵之列焉。朱素聰穎，自幼即粗解文義，蔽說部書，恒深羡年少英俊如黃大霸流之爲人，於京卿之文弱過甚，極有自傷非偶之感。於是一以梨園歌榭爲造悶地，時李春來出演某園，以武生戲著稱，桂珍日往留連，久之遂相狎，馴至鵲指巢鳩，公然如伉儷，雖人言籍籍，中　之恥，論者至指京卿以爲戒，而春來稔知桂珍積有鉅貲，遂亦無復顧忌。某日，春來方登場，桂珍後至，與觀衆爭座位不得，歸而大憤，因與春來謀，欲獨闢一園，李亦久蓄此意，乃輟演某院，另賃新址，與某園望衡對宇，建築裝置，務極華麗，而陳飾美妙，胥屬別出心裁，爲爾時各戲園之冠，名曰春桂，即以二人之名以名園也。自是偕往偕來，儼然夫婦，旋春來以事被逮，桂珍輦金當道，四出運動，不以春來被押而有所變異也。或謂春來之名大著，由於桂珍之力良多，而春桂園之建立，蓋猶其餘事也。不知其然否？</p>
<h3>從西山到上海</h3>
<p>— 遊記者</p>
<p>一九四〇的中國電影界，被掘發了一顆燦爛的新人，她，便是從西山到上海的紫微。十八年以前的甯波「西山」村，它留給古老美麗的原野一個新的萌芽，紫微，剩下來便在左手的臂膀上留了一顆活像小鴿蛋那麼大小的黑黑的印痣的奇蹟。</p>
<p>他的過去，一長串被頑皮活動的血淚創造了的生活斷片是支配了學校生活，家庭生活，以及運動，跳舞，和現在的戲劇生活。</p>
<p>三個月前，在藝華羅致兵馬掘發新人的努力下，被聘爲基本演員。簽訂合同那天，便開始在鉅片「刺秦王」裏完成了水銀燈的處，一夜。</p>
<p>她原名王麗珍，從前在一個教會女學校裏讀書，但也曾躍上火山，大東，那裏曾消磨了她十個月的伴舞生涯。然而她太厭倦了那種不見太陽的生活。</p>
<p>紫微身長五尺二寸，體重一〇五磅，恰是好萊塢大明星的標準條件，體格和容貌也够健美，藝華在「刺秦王」以後，便派她更艱重地在「觀世音」一片中演飾大公主，對於她的重視正是一個鐵的事實。</p>
<p>她，紫微，「現在簡直想安靜一下子，讓有限的人生來培養無盡的生命。」他告訴記者，自己將改變而且嚴肅着自己底性情和意志了。</p>
<p>從西山道上海，在一個偶然的機會中，紫微，她告訴了她自己，關於一長串青烟樣輕淡美麗的故事，像三月的春天樣她的微笑，以及南風那麼柔軟和諧的調子是黑咖啡樣濃烈地使人憧憬她那光輝底前途哪</p>
<h3>泰山口中的影星健美術</h3>
<p>— 燁爍</p>
<p>約翰韋斯摩勒，是一位身長六尺四寸，體重一九〇磅的運動家，牠最擅長的游泳，曾經獲得世界運動會的游泳冠軍。</p>
<p>他曾對人說，「好萊塢的女影星，一天比一天的健美起來，其主要的原因是運動，習之既久，於是氣色好了，眼珠有神，身體也更加健美起來。」</p>
<p>他並且舉了許多例，說：「環克勞馥勤於運動，很有恒心，她對跳舞和游泳都有相當的心得。珍妮麥唐納是網球仝羽毛球的好手。茂娜洛埃不僅是游泳家，並且頑得一手好羽毛球。羅琳洛珊兒和蓓蒂黛維絲是騎馬專家。……」</p>
<p>最後，韋斯摩勒又說：「我不是美容博士，可是我知道運動的價值，它能够使好萊塢的女影星更加健美起來。」</p>

<p>大概是八歲到十六歲的孩童是最多數吧，他們喜愛武俠影片；他們的目的，是在看片中的飛簷走壁，騰雲駕霧和舞刀弄槍等等的武藝。</p>
<p>講到看電影的目的，除新良所說：「看電影不該單是爲樂消遣，娛樂，我們應該從那些好的電影劇本中，吸取各種新的學問，新的知識。」以外更應培養我們的道德和人格，改善我們的生活和習慣。現在筆者將過去的國產片中符合上列一點的，略寫一二在後：</p>
<p>前民新公司的「靈肉之門」一片，確能感動人不少；它的大意是一個四口之家，—慈愛的媽媽，一個聰明的小哥，一個天真的小弟，和一個嗜酒愛賭的爸爸：整個家庭爲了一個不知上進的爸爸，而陷於極度悽慘的狀態。後來經過小哥長時期的忍耐，和婉轉感人的行爲和苦勸，把一個沒有靈魂的爸爸勸醒過來了，棄邪歸正，悔過自新，因之得着他的新生命，以後便度着融融洩洩的新生活了。</p>

<h3>The Japanese Army's Advance on Zhongshan: More Than Half Annihilated by Chinese Interception, Guangzhou Japanese Army Concentrates to Attack Northern Guangdong Again, Intending to Relieve Pressure on the Chinese Army in Nanning Area</h3>
<p>Sihui: The Japanese army advancing towards Zhongshan was annihilated by more than half near Dieshi on the evening of the 7th. The remaining troops are still being encircled and annihilated. The Japanese army, which landed in Xiangzhou and advanced northward, was intercepted by the Chinese army near Qianshan Village. The fierce battle continued until the evening of the 7th, and the Japanese suffered extremely heavy casualties. Fighting continues at this moment. (8th telegram)</p>
<p>Guilin: Due to the Japanese invasion of Zhongshan, the situation suddenly became tense. The Macao authorities notified nearby Chinese to evacuate. The Japanese marines then landed at Xiangzhou Wharf north of Macao. In the afternoon, the Japanese reached the vicinity of Qianshan Village north of Macao, and Macao felt greatly threatened. (8th telegram)</p>
<p>Binyang: The Japanese army in Datang has been attacked by the Chinese army for several consecutive days and suffered extremely heavy casualties. On the 4th, more than 1,000 Japanese troops fled to Qinxian via Xiaodong. On the morning of the 5th, they were again intercepted by the Chinese army near Naxue, engaging in a fierce battle for three hours. The remaining Japanese troops were routed, and the Chinese army is currently in pursuit. (8th telegram)</p>
<p>Xuwen: On the morning of the 6th, the Japanese army on Hainan Island launched a fierce attack on Wenchang, Anren, and nearby areas. The Chinese army met them head-on and delivered a painful blow. The Japanese launched repeated assaults, but were all repelled. As of noon on the 7th, it is estimated that 500-600 Japanese soldiers were killed. The momentum of the Japanese has been greatly frustrated. Fighting continued until late at night. (8th telegram)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to news from here today, the Japanese army northeast and northwest of Macao is currently being attacked by Chinese guerrillas who, although poorly equipped, possess an extremely firm will. There is currently fierce fighting within Zhongshan, behind Macao. According to the Chinese side, the Japanese attack on Zhongshan has no military significance; if any, it is to divert the attention of the Chinese, causing the Chinese army in northern Guangdong to neglect defense. It is reported that the Japanese army concentrating in the Guangzhou area consists of three divisions, and will likely launch another large-scale attack on northern Guangdong. At the same time, the Japanese side has also concentrated a large army in the Yuezhou area, clearly preparing for another attempt to attack Changsha. The purpose of the Japanese actions is to relieve the pressure on Nanning from the Chinese army, which has already advanced to within seven miles of the outskirts of Nanning. (8th United Press telegram)</p>
<p>Guinan Front Line: The remnants of the Japanese army on the Yongbin Road are mostly entrenched in the Er Tang area, and have not dared to move for several days. There is no change on the Yongwu Road, and everything is under close control. (8th telegram)</p>

<p>Chongqing: Chinese military sources here have confirmed that after landing in Macao, the Japanese army is now attempting to attack Zhongshan. Zhongshan is the hometown of Sun Yat-sen. It was occupied by the Japanese army last October, but was soon recovered by the Chinese army. This time, because March 12 is the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth, the Japanese army is attempting to attack Zhongshan again. Therefore, Chinese military personnel believe that the Japanese attack on Zhongshan is not militarily necessary, but contains political significance. (8th Huitong News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>Macao: Reuters has learned that the Japanese army has continued to occupy several key points in the Zhongshan area. The customs battery in the Bashaliang (transliteration) area near Macao has also fallen. The Japanese side is now distributing leaflets urging the people to submit to the regime.

<p>Guangzhou: According to a public statement issued here, the Japanese army completely occupied Zhongshan at around 10:00 this morning. Subsequently, a Japanese military spokesperson here stated that the purpose of the military operation in the Zhongshan area is to eliminate Chinese guerrillas.

As for whether the Japanese army will remain stationed in Zhongshan, or withdraw after the guerrillas are dispersed, it is currently undecided. (8th Reuters telegram)</p>
<p>Zhongshan: After Chinese and Japanese sentries clashed north of Laba Island (transliteration), residents of nearby villages fled into Macao. The Japanese army conscripted 2,000 people from a certain village to transport grain to Tangjia. It is reported that major Macao merchants gathered at the Chamber of Commerce today and resolved to take in refugees entering Macao, most of whom fled alone, without carrying any clothing.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Fuel Problem</h3>
<p>The panic of life in Shanghai, although maintained by various efforts, is still flourishing. The threat of the fuel problem to general life is no less serious than the food problem. People cannot live without water and fire. General families in Shanghai used to rely on firewood and charcoal. Since the promotion of coal balls, firewood and charcoal have been replaced, which is also a natural trend. Given the scarcity of houses and the density of population in Shanghai, any daily necessities that occupy less storage space and have the same effect will naturally be welcomed. In addition, quite a few people use kerosene, smoky coal, and anthracite to cook. In normal times, fuel is not considered expensive because supply and demand are balanced, but recently it is not the same as before. Smoky coal is 210-220 yuan per ton, anthracite is 170-180 yuan, firewood is 1.5 yuan per bundle, charcoal is more than 10 yuan per load, kerosene is 14-15 yuan per can, and coal balls are 120 yuan per ton, which is still considered a bargain, but the deficit is worrying, and I am deeply afraid that it will be difficult to continue; but the price of each item is five or six times higher than before the war.</p>
<p>Why is the increase so high? This is certainly related to the relationship between supply and demand and cost, but special forces also contribute to it. Since the outbreak of the war, transportation between Shanghai and other places has changed; and the import of products from the mainland into Shanghai has been subject to disguised control, endless extortion, and very harsh demands, resulting in extremely heavy costs. When they are transported to Shanghai, they are often detained. For example, firewood has been detained since the end of last year and has not been released. I don't know what the intention is. Now, coal is imported from Wusong. If it has not been transported to the dock for loading and unloading, it cannot be considered that the goods have arrived safely, because they are often intercepted midway and forced to be resold. In an unstable environment, how can the price of goods be expected to be stable? In addition, with the outbreak of the European war, freight rates have soared. It costs 32 shillings to transport one ton of Indian coal to Shanghai, and 27 shillings to transport one ton of Annam coal. If calculated in legal tender, the freight cost per ton is as high as 80-90 yuan. Is it not like going south by chariot and heading north to expect the price to fall? Indian coal originally occupied a very small position in the coal market, but now it has become the main source of supply, and it is impossible to light a fire without it. Anthracite used to be supplied in large quantities from Liujiang and Shanxi, but since they fell into enemy hands, the source has been suddenly blocked, and everything depends on Hongji anthracite. The amount of Kailuan coal, which used to be a large supplier of smoky coal, is less than expected, so its price is cheap, but it is not easy to buy on the market. In the past, the amount of coal transported from Japan to Shanghai for sale was also large and could compete with Kailuan coal. Recently, Japan is also suffering from a coal shortage. Although there is still a small amount of coal shipped to Shanghai, it is not enough to meet the needs of Japanese factories, and coal production in North China is being carried away by the Japanese, making it necessary for Shanghai to seek coal from the south. Shanghai coal merchants see an opportunity to hoard and speculate. Even if there is a mountain of inventory, they are unwilling to sell it on the market, so the goods on the market become more scarce, and the situation of the coal shortage becomes more precarious.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to solve the fuel problem in Shanghai, the fundamental solution is to increase supply and level freight rates. This is only a small solution. If there is more supply and the cost is lower, the price will naturally be stable. However, the increase in supply has to rely on a large amount of supply from coal production in North China, but whether we can get what we want is difficult to predict. The responsibility for reducing freight rates lies with the shipping industry, but the shipping industry believes that it is not only affected by the war, and that the soaring freight rates are also due to the high price of coal and the difficulty in reducing freight rates, so if the price of coal can be lowered, the freight rate will naturally fall. The coal industry believes that the high freight rate makes it difficult to lower the cost of coal, but the freight rate will be reduced and the price of coal will be stable. Which came first, the chicken or the egg, is impossible to determine, but both are for private gain. However, if the price of coal is not fundamentally leveled first, and the current cheap sale of coal balls is used to solve the difficulty of the fuel problem, it is still a long way from the topic. Even with the cheap sale of four catties of coal balls per person for one corner, the maximum is only 1,000 loads, and if there is any benefit to be gained, it is only 25,000 people; 40,000 to 50,000 people return with empty baskets every day, and only this embellishment is enough to pacify the people.</p>
<p>If the fuel problem is not solved for a day, the impact will not only make it difficult to use fuel at home. On a small scale, the problem of coal use in the boiled water industry is indeed worrying. If it is forced to stop business or increase prices due to lack of fuel, it will cause deep and great inconvenience to residents and suffering to the poor. On a large scale, coal is the food of machines. If they stop moving due to lack of coal, it will inevitably lead to the problem of unemployment of workers. This indirect impact is more serious than any other problem. Some factories plan to use anthracite or diesel to replace coal, but the price difference is not much, and the firepower is not easy to exert unless the boiler is modified, so it is difficult to share the panic of smoky coal for a while. Therefore, in addition to increasing ships and reducing freight rates to ensure smooth sources and lower costs, there is no other way to solve the problem of coal. As for wanting to accumulate coal in order to balance supply and demand and avoid exhaustion and return to a stable level, the current high price of coal is too heavy to bear, and I am afraid that it cannot be borne by the coal industry alone. Only by each industry seeking its own way, raising funds to order goods, and storing them for its own use, although the procedures are more complicated and the consumption is larger, there is no need to seek the convenience of the coal industry, but it is also a helpless move.</p>
<p>Electricity is also an important fuel in cities (lighting power heat). Since coal is expensive, electricity bills have also repeatedly increased surcharges, and recently have increased to more than 114%, more than doubling the original price. The power company purchases coal from mine owners and has a long-term contract. Because it is for direct consumption, the price is relatively cheap, so its cost is not comparable to that of general factories using coal. The power company's coal purchase contract has not yet expired, but it has repeatedly increased surcharges to plan ahead. If the contract expires and is revised, the price of coal will also increase according to the market ratio, and I don't know how much the electricity surcharge will increase. Electricity is a public utility, so it is allowed to be monopolized, so its business policy is not comparable to that of general industrial and commercial enterprises whose sole purpose is to make profits. Although its increase in fees is also out of necessity, it should obtain the consent of the Public Utilities Committee of the Gongbu Bureau as usual, but since it increases the burden on users, it is appropriate to share it with users so that everyone is aware of the reasons for the increase and why it must be increased by so many percentages, and there is no objection. I will regard the power company as the same as ordinary merchants who only seek profit. Is this the original intention of public utilities? I would like to say a word for the power company because of the fuel problem.</p>
<h3>The US Actively Provides Economic Aid to China: A US$10 Million Loan is Established, the Chinese Government Guarantees Tin Exports to be Used to Purchase Necessary Construction Goods</h3>
<p>Washington: Jones, chairman of the Construction Bank Corporation, announced last night that the Export-Import Bank had allocated US$20 million yesterday for new loans to China. The funds were allocated from the new US$100 million in capital of the Export-Import Bank. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the United States has lent China a total of US$45 million, the first time US$25 million and this time US$20 million. Chen Guangfu, head of the Chinese Purchasing and Financial Inspection Group, said, "China will purchase hardware, gasoline, trucks, road-building machinery, mining and smelting machinery, medicines, and other necessary raw materials for construction through the Universal Trading Corporation. China will also continue to transport China's tung oil, tin ore, and other raw materials to the United States through the Universal Trading Corporation to meet the needs of US industries. Hu Shi, the Chinese ambassador to the United States, said, "We are extremely satisfied with the US government's timely financial assistance to the Chinese government." (8th United Press telegram)</p>
<p>Washington: The Export-Import Bank has announced that its board of directors has approved a loan of $20 million to China to facilitate the financing of non-military exports from the United States. It is reported that the United States will use tin transported from Yunnan Province as part of the payment for this loan, $10 million for Denmark and $1 million for Iceland. According to the capital of the Export-Import Bank, the National Assembly has approved an increase of 100 million to lend to China, Finland and other countries, so the bank has allocated $200,000 to Finland on January and $15 million to Sweden, $10 million for Norway. (8th Reuters telegram)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Chinese authorities here regard the new US loan of US$20 million to China as a "gesture of friendship." A senior official of the Ministry of Finance said, "The new US loan to China will enhance our confidence in foreign aid and final victory." (8th United Press telegram)</p>
<p>Chongqing According to a Chinese government spokesman today, "The US loan to China this time shows the good trust of foreign governments in China. The reasons for this trust of foreign governments are two: (1) China's outstanding performance in fulfilling international debt credit; (2) The Sino-Japanese War has turned into a stage favorable to China." It also said, "In recent weeks, the assistance of friendly countries to China, although in different ways, has increased a lot." According to foreign observers, although the amount of the US loan to China this time is small, it is still a major spiritual blow to the Japanese government, so the relationship between Japan and the United States will inevitably become more deteriorated in the future. (8th United Press telegram)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Side Feels Deeply Anxious, Believing That the US Move is Not Friendly</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Suma, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, told reporters last night after Washington announced a loan of US$10 million to China, "This is an unfriendly action, and we are extremely unwilling to see it become a reality." Suma also said, "On the eve of the establishment of the Wang Jingwei "Central Government", Japan is particularly dissatisfied with the US move. The United States often has legal basis for lending to China, and Japan has no reason to oppose it, but this loan is obviously an effective aid to the National Government."

<h3>The Saying That the Tianjin Silver Issue Has Been Negotiated Has Been Firmly Denied by the Foreign Ministry, and the British Ambassador Has Also Stated That It Is Not True</h3>
<p>Chongqing: There are rumors that the Foreign Ministry of the National Government has negotiated with Sir Kerr, the British Ambassador, on the Chinese silver issue in the British Concession in Tianjin. Tonight, the Foreign Ministry and the British Ambassador have firmly denied this rumor. Sir Kerr told a Reuters reporter, "The rumor that I have negotiated with the Chinese Foreign Ministry on the Tianjin silver issue is not true." The Chinese Foreign Ministry also made the same denial. A spokesman told Reuters, "This rumor is completely untrue." Some people say that the rumor has spread prematurely, but according to the opinions of people here, this compromise may never be reached.

<h3>Zhu Jiahua Re-discusses the European War Situation</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Today's Central Daily News published the second part of an essay by Zhu Jiahua, the Minister of Organization of the Central Party Headquarters. The first part appeared in yesterday's paper. The article analyzes in detail the power of various European countries in the war and predicts possible developments, stating that the Soviet Union cannot provide Germany with much economic assistance due to political, economic, and practical reasons. Although Germany and the Soviet Union are currently using each other, it is clear that the Soviet Union does not want to see Germany dominate European trade. This is why the German-Soviet military alliance has never gone beyond the stage of propaganda. The quantity of Soviet exports is currently not likely to be excessive, and what the Soviet Union currently needs from Germany are mostly products and raw materials needed by Germany's own war industry. The trade agreement between the two countries will not be implemented, and cash trade will not be significant. The Soviet Union's transportation problems also severely limit the transport of Soviet products to Germany. Under the current transportation situation, the Soviet Union can at most allocate one-tenth of its transportation tools solely for the transportation of Soviet raw materials to Germany, which is far too little to meet Germany's needs. Hitler is well aware of Germany's weaknesses and is using submarines, magnetic mines, aircraft, and pocket battleships in the hope of intercepting supplies from Canada, Australia, and New Zealand to Britain. However, this guerrilla strategy is not very effective. Experience has shown that even land guerrilla strategies cannot determine the outcome of any war without the support of a regular army. Germany's most proud air force cannot win it victory. Moreover, Germany will eventually have to cede its air superiority to the Allied side. According to estimates, only one pilot can be produced for every thousand people. Assuming that each aircraft requires four pilots, no European country can have the personnel needed for 20,000 aircraft. Britain, France, and their colonies have a population of over 600,500,000, so there is no shortage of manpower. Therefore, Germany's air force may currently have an advantage, but it will eventually be surpassed by the Allied countries. Germany will one day not dare to send its air force to Britain and France for fear of suffering heavy losses that cannot be replenished. Moreover, 60% of Germany's industrial areas are located within 150 kilometers of the front line, while most of Britain's industrial areas are more than 300 kilometers away. The degree of safety is naturally incomparable. The article concludes that the outcome of the war must be decided by the two armies on land. Both sides are currently trying to exhaust the other's strength and do not intend to use their land forces until they are exhausted or nearly exhausted. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>Britain Pursues Appeasement Policy Towards Japan; Chongqing English Newspaper Criticizes</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The English-language Chu Pao published here today strongly criticized Britain's appeasement policy towards Japan. According to the newspaper, although Japan constantly infringes on Britain's interests in China, Britain has repeatedly delayed and taken no action. Observers say that Britain's policy in the Far East is a complete retreat. From this point of view, it is not far from the truth. Looking back on the past, we cannot but admit that the attitude of the Chamberlain government was fundamentally wrong. We firmly believe that the crux of the matter lies in Britain's belief in its appeasement policy towards Japan. We dare say that if Britain takes no action against Japan's aggression, Britain's reputation in the Far East will be completely lost. British expatriates in China should report their sufferings to their government and draw its attention. (United Press dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3>Sweden Mediates; Soviet-Finnish Direct Negotiations on Armistice; Finnish Delegation Arrives in Moscow; Rumors of New Peace Terms Proposed by Soviet Union</h3>
<p>London: Diplomatic sources here have confirmed that representatives of the Finnish government have arrived in Moscow to discuss peace terms with the Soviet authorities, as proposed by the Soviet Union through Sweden. Although the Finnish government considered it inappropriate to accept, it was forced to decide to negotiate with the Soviet Union due to the difficulty in obtaining assistance from Britain and France. As far as the military situation is concerned, it is not yet hopeless, so the mission of the Finnish delegation is limited to negotiations. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: According to reliable sources in the capital, representatives from Finland, Sweden, Germany, and the Soviet Union are currently negotiating to mediate the Finnish war. However, this statement has not been officially confirmed. It is heard that Sven Hufvud, the former president of Finland, and Baschkiwiwi, who was engaged in negotiations with the Soviet Union before the war, have arrived in Stockholm. The German participant in the negotiations is apparently Ditwan Lich, the director of the intelligence office of the National Socialist Party, who secretly flew here for a day. Discussions on the possibility of establishing peace have undoubtedly been underway for many days. However, the Swedish authorities have consistently denied being "mediators" in the negotiations. The general opinion is that the Finns, in order to avoid further losses, may propose ceding the areas demanded by the Soviet Union before the war, with the possible exception of Hango Island. However, this proposal is apparently insufficient. Today, it is heard that the conditions required by the Soviet Union include the following points: (1) Petsamo, along with nickel mines and fishing rights; (2) Finland to destroy all coastal fortresses; (3) The entire Finnish coast of Viela and Lake Ladoga, including Sortavala. It is heard that the Soviet Union is prepared to cancel its demands for Hango. The Swedish side denies that Germany and Sweden have put any pressure on the Finnish government to accept these conditions. Telephone communications between Stockholm and several foreign capitals were interrupted last night and were reportedly restored at midnight. However, telephone calls from London were again rejected by Stockholm this morning. According to the Swedish authorities, the decision to temporarily suspend news telephone calls was due to the fact that non-British journalists had sent incorrect news yesterday. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: The rumor about Sweden mediating the Soviet-Finnish conflict has now been further confirmed. Finnish cabinet minister Baschkiwiwi, along with former Finnish President Svinhufvud, has arrived here to conduct peace negotiations with Soviet Ambassador to Sweden Golentai. (Haitong dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: This morning, representatives of Finland and the Soviet Union are directly negotiating here, but in order to strictly maintain the secrecy of the talks, they are meeting in a building on the shore of Lake Mälaren outside Stockholm. Former Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko told representatives of the press that he hoped the public would remain calm and peaceful and wait for the truth to come to light, and not lightly believe rumors and make wild guesses. Finland is currently still at war and has not announced a ceasefire. This is the only fact. (Haitong dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: According to well-informed sources, former Finnish Finance Minister Tanner, who was negotiating in Stockholm, returned to Helsinki on the 1st of this month, accompanied by a representative of the Swedish government. The Finnish cabinet held a meeting on the 2nd of this month, and Tanner reported on the negotiations, stating briefly that the Swedish government was willing to be a mediator between the Soviet Union and Finland, and the Soviet Union had accepted Sweden's mediation proposal. The representative of the Swedish government immediately reported the Soviet Union's peace proposals to the Finnish cabinet. When the Finnish cabinet debated the issue, some cabinet members favored peace, while others still hoped that the Allied powers would step up their assistance. However, most cabinet members were very skeptical about the assistance of the Allied powers. The Finnish cabinet then decided to accept Sweden's mediation proposal, and the Finnish representatives set off for Stockholm on the 6th of this month. (Haitong dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Non-official circles in Finland have expressed surprise at the peace terms proposed by the Soviet Union to Finland via Sweden and believe that Sweden's willingness to act as a mediator for the alleged terms is astonishing. Finland learned of these terms from the New York News telegram published in Stockholm. The Finnish government has issued a statement stating that these terms are said to be broader in scope than those proposed last fall, but the content is still unknown. There has been much discussion in diplomatic circles about these terms. It is said that, on the one hand, the Finnish government is paying close attention to Sweden's mediation, and on the other hand, it must be aware that Finnish public opinion will not allow negotiations to be conducted on the basis of these terms, as it believes that the Soviet Union has not achieved much victory after months of war and should not make concessions that are detrimental to national independence. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Today, when a spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry met with foreign journalists, he was asked whether the negotiations between the representatives of the Soviet Union and Finland in Stockholm were promoted by Germany. He replied that Germany's attitude towards the Soviet-Finnish conflict remains the same as before and has not changed since the outbreak of the Soviet-Finnish war. I personally do not know about this matter, so I cannot answer about the peace negotiations in Stockholm. Someone said, "Then can you deny the rumors that Germany is involved in this matter?" The spokesman replied, "I cannot deny it either, because I know nothing about this matter." (Haitong dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>The Hague: The rumor that Sweden is mediating the war between Finland and the Soviet Union has been confirmed by news from Stockholm. Although political figures in that country have refused to disclose any information in order to avoid hindering the negotiations, they have also admitted that the conditions proposed by the Soviet government are even broader in scope than those proposed before the Soviet-Finnish war. In addition, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Swedish Parliament has been holding daily meetings in recent days, but it is still unknown whether Finnish representatives have attended. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: The status of the negotiations to mediate the Soviet-Finnish war is currently unknown, as the Foreign Ministry has not had any special activities in the past 24 hours. It is generally speculated that the meeting place is probably the residence of Swedish financiers or industrialists. (Haitong dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: Finnish Prime Minister Tiete and Cabinet Minister Basiviki (who represented Finland in negotiations with the Soviet Union before the outbreak of the Finnish-Soviet War) are currently here. According to rumors from some quarters, the two may go to Moscow today to hold talks with the Soviet authorities. As for the rumors that Finnish Army Commander-in-Chief Mannerheim and General are also in Stockholm, there is no basis for them. Swedish Foreign Minister Gönder recently told an interviewer from "Daily Overview" that various rumors about the Finnish situation are not factual and are intended to be misleading. The media should not lightly believe them. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>The Hague: Local newspapers have recently published news from Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, stating that Finnish Ambassador to Sweden Erkko and Soviet Ambassador to Sweden Madame Golontei have begun peace negotiations through the mediation of Swedish Foreign Minister Hesede. Although the Swedish authorities have not confirmed this statement, they have not denied it. According to several observers, peace negotiations have indeed begun. A well-known Finnish politician, the current Minister without Portfolio, Baschkiwiwi, who represented the country in negotiations with the Soviet Union before the outbreak of the Finnish-Soviet War, arrived in Stockholm a few days ago, along with the Director of Public Relations of the Finnish Foreign Ministry. In addition, Dietrich, the Director of the Intelligence Department of the German Foreign Ministry, secretly traveled to Stockholm for a day and then returned to Germany. The German Ambassador to Finland also had a long conversation with General Rosenbo, the representative of General Mannerheim, the Commander-in-Chief of Finland, to inform him of Germany's views on the issue of Finnish-Soviet peace.

<p>Paris: Well-informed sources in Paris have recently stated that there is no question of the Soviet Union issuing an ultimatum to Finland expiring tonight, but there are actions by Germany and Sweden to establish peace in the Soviet-Finnish war.

At the same time, four islands west of the town of Piccalanda in northern Lake Ladoga were also occupied by Soviet troops (the four islands being Maxinnan Sari Island, Pecho Sari Island, Pechomin O Sari Island, and Xiangka Sari Island). The Soviet Air Force bombed the enemy troops and shot down 15 enemy aircraft in aerial combat. (TASS dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting Around Vyborg</p>
<p>Helsinki: Soviet troops attempted to advance across the ice in the Finnish Bay, resulting in fierce fighting. It is heard that there are piles of corpses in the forests around Vyborg. According to various sources, the intensity of the Soviet military offensive and bloody battles is unprecedented. However, it is heard that the Soviet army has been temporarily contained by the Finnish army's machine gun fire and the Finnish air force's intense bombing. When the Soviet army attacked, it gathered a large number of tanks and armored vehicles to advance across the ice, resulting in foolproof bombing targets for the Finnish artillery and aircraft. In this terrible battle, the number of Soviet soldiers who could still advance was very small. According to Finnish military reconnaissance reports, the Soviet side is currently massively reallocating its troops. The Finnish side said that this is due to the Soviet side's underestimation of the resistance it will encounter in Vyborg. The Finnish side's latest battle report stated that the Soviet army's fierce attack on the northwestern coast of Vyborg Bay in the western part of the Karelian Isthmus is currently fighting at the mouth of Vyborg Bay, and the Soviet troops advancing across the ice to seize the islands in the area have been heavily shelled by the Finnish side, destroying more than 30 tanks. The Finnish army between Vyborg Bay and Vostuga repelled a local Soviet attack, destroying 17 tanks. In the Deibel area, the Soviet side launched an attack after shelling, but was repelled. On the north side of Lake Ladoga, the Soviet army attacked in Piccalanda and the islands, and has occupied several islands defended by the Finnish army. The Finnish Air Force bombed Soviet troops on the ice of the Gulf of Finland and Vyborg Bay. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: A plan by Soviet troops to break through the Finnish military defense line in Vyborg Bay has completely failed. As a result of the Finnish military counterattack, several coastal strongholds have been recaptured. No less than 30 Red Army tanks were destroyed in one day yesterday, and their communication lines with the rear food stations have been severely threatened. In addition, although the Red Army repeatedly attacked on the northeast side of Lake Ladoga, it failed to succeed. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>Finnish Ambassador to Britain Speaks</p>
<p>London: The Finnish Ambassador to London told a Reuters reporter today that Finland is always prepared to make peace with the Soviet Union, but not unconditionally. Finland's independence must be preserved. He also said that he had visited British Foreign Secretary Halifax yesterday, but was unwilling to disclose the content of their conversation. The ambassador also mentioned the terms proposed by the Soviet Union in the news, saying that if the rumors are true, the Soviet Union seems to have increased its demands, especially regarding the two places of the Karelian Isthmus and the north side of Lake Ladoga. Another Finnish spokesperson said that 100 volunteers arrive in Finland every day at the moment, and the nephew of former US President Roosevelt will also go to Finland soon, and it is said that he can lead 3,000 people with him.

<p>The Finnish Situation Has Reached a Decisive Stage</p>
<p>The Hague: London is extremely excited about the news of the mediation of the Soviet-Finnish war. The general impression is that the Finnish issue has reached a decisive stage. Although British officials remain silent and avoid making comments, political figures are clearly worried that the credibility of the Allied powers will suffer serious losses after the success of the mediation. London claims that Britain and France may make a decision in the next few days, and if they do not interfere in the Finnish issue, the efforts to encourage Finland to resist will be reduced. Britain is very angry because it believes that Sweden is putting pressure on Finland to accept the Soviet demands, but the general opinion is that Norway will oppose the Soviet Union's territorial demands and tend to support the Allied powers' plan to aid Finland. (Haitong dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>China Hopes for a Ceasefire Between the Soviet Union and Finland</p>
<p>Chongqing: No definite news has been received regarding the rumored peace talks between the Soviet Union and Finland, and Chinese officials are strictly silent on the dispute between the Soviet Union and Finland. However, the general Chinese public here welcomes the possible news of peace between the two countries. The Finnish war has put China in the most complex position, causing China to abstain from voting at the League of Nations meeting. Therefore, in this Sino-Japanese war, although the Soviet Union has provided valuable assistance to China, China itself has been invaded by Japan, so it cannot openly support the Soviet invasion of Finland. It is generally believed that a satisfactory end to the Soviet-Finnish peace talks will automatically solve the complex problem that Chinese leaders have been constantly paying attention to, that is, what policy China should take if the Soviet Union is drawn into the European war. Once the Soviet Union and Finland make peace, the danger of the Soviet Union being drawn into a war against Britain and France will be reduced, and the Soviet Union will be able to pay more attention to the Far East. If the Finnish war drags on, the Soviet Union will obviously have to deploy most of its military force to the European front, and the result may be a compromise policy with Japan in the Far East. It is expected that peace between the Soviet Union and Finland will greatly reduce the Soviet Union's anxieties in Europe, and the Soviet Union will be in a position to focus on the Far East and be able to step up its assistance to China. This will not be possible if the Finnish war continues. Furthermore, Soviet-Finnish peace will generally accelerate the peaceful situation in Europe and severely hit Japan. The Western countries cannot pay attention to the Far East due to their own disputes. Once peace is in sight in Europe, Japan's position is particularly dangerous. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Tragic Car Accident in Finland</p>
<p>Helsinki: A fast train bound for Sweden collided with a special train near Tampere yesterday, killing 20 passengers, including 16 evacuated children, and injuring 20 passengers. The accident occurred in the dark and in heavy wind and snow, so the driver could not see the danger signals. Many children were burned to death in the carriages. The scene of women searching for their children in the deep snow was pitiful. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3>Welles Visits Paris Authorities, Inquires About French Viewpoint on the War, Peace Impossible Without Concrete Guarantees from Germany, Poland, Austria, and Czechoslovakia Must Restore Independence and Territorial Integrity</h3>
<p>Paris - U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles visited French President Lebrun and Premier Daladier yesterday. It is understood that their discussions included France's perspective on the war, relations between France and Italy, and the situation on the Scandinavian Peninsula. Mr. Welles arrived fifteen minutes earlier than scheduled and visited the French President before the reception preparations were completed. The conversation lasted over an hour, unlike the usual brief courtesy calls. After leaving the Presidential Palace, he drove to the Ministry of War and spoke with Daladier for another one hour and forty minutes. Afterward, Daladier told a Reuters reporter that he was very satisfied with Mr. Welles' visit and conversation. Last night, Mr. Welles attended a banquet at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with few guests. Mr. Welles then continued his conversation with Daladier, which was probably the most important conversation during Mr. Welles' visit to Paris. Judging from the guest list, the nature of the banquet was more official than social, as the attendees included Vice President Schutemps, Minister of Justice Pomaret, Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Le Bas, and Mr. Goulond from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to responsible sources, France explained the following war aims to Mr. Welles: (1) Restore the independence and territorial integrity of Poland, Austria, and Czechoslovakia; (2) Any peace must have significant and concrete guarantees from Germany to prevent future German aggression; (3) France does not want a superficial peace that would leave Europe vulnerable to German threats in the future. France has no desire to dominate Europe, and Germany must show that it has abandoned such intentions. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Paris - U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles visited French Senate President Jeanneney and House Speaker Herriot this morning. He then held talks with Socialist leader and former Premier Blum. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>London - When U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles comes here next week, in addition to meeting with Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax, he will also discuss the current situation with opposition leader Attlee and deputy leader Greenwood. It is expected that Mr. Welles will also meet with Liberal Party leader Sinclair. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>London - According to a special dispatch from here, the "Brazilian Daily" commented on the peace mission of U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles, stating that negotiations are impossible between the Allied countries and the Munich betrayers and their repeatedly treacherous government. The "Al-Ahram" newspaper in Cairo also commented, stating that peace is currently impossible. The Treaty of Versailles lasted twenty-five years; if today's peace cannot last three months, Europe and the entire world must first eliminate the vicious and harmful elements. These elements are rarely seen throughout the world. If they are allowed to spread, they will endanger all of humanity and cause humanity to regress for centuries. Therefore, the free, independent, and glorious United States or other countries do not want to recognize the sword as the ruler of the world or violence as the judge of humanity. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Passes Air Force Budget, Air Minister Wood Attends and Explains, Aircraft Production Increased to One Hundred Percent</h3>
<p>London - When Air Minister Wood concluded the debate on the Air Force budget in the House of Commons last night, he made unrestricted guarantees that the British bomber fleet was ready for large-scale operations. After Mr. Wood's speech, the entire House passed the budget amidst cheers. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>London - When Air Minister Wood presented the Air Force budget in the House of Commons, he declared that, for the sake of security, the total budget amount would not be disclosed. He could only say that this year's Air Force budget was unprecedented in nature. The greatest efforts and expenditures on air defense were unprecedented in any era, but this budget only represents a part of the continued actions that we intend to take in conjunction with the Empire and the Allied countries. Our expenditures and efforts cannot be limited to this year; they must continue and increase until we achieve our established goal, which is the establishment of air superiority. Mr. Wood continued by saying that the British Air Force bomber fleet stationed in France had carried out over a thousand raids deep into German territory day and night. The majority of the British Air Force soldiers stationed in France had been active over the Siegfried Line, with the number of takeoffs for patrols, pursuits, and engagements with enemy aircraft totaling no less than two thousand. Our Air Force soldiers have fully demonstrated their value, shooting down more than forty enemy aircraft around our country's coasts without any losses on our side. We also understand that many other enemy aircraft were forced to land in neutral countries or at sea. Mr. Wood further explained the progress of the British Air Force, saying that when he presented last year's budget, the total number of personnel in the British Air Force was one hundred thousand. Today, each Air Force command controls nearly this number of personnel. Since the start of the war, the Coastal Command's fleet has traveled over five million miles. They have discovered submarines more than one hundred times and attacked them more than sixty times. In addition, there have been more than seven hundred convoys protected by aircraft, which has been quite effective. Mr. Wood also mentioned cooperation with France, saying that its nature is extremely close, with extensive plans for exchanging information, jointly researching aircraft production, and mutually sharing secret equipment, with joint enjoyment of various new developments. As for overseas training aviation organizations, if fully utilized, the flight schools in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand can train 20,000 pilots and 30,000 crew members each year. In addition, the South African government has made extremely helpful proposals for training British Air Force pilots. Flight schools will also be established in Rhodesia and Kenya. Regarding production, new factories are being established every month. The output of factories manufacturing aircraft continues to increase. A plan has been drawn up to ensure that future production will be more than adequate. The production plans of the various autonomous territories have also begun to take effect. The first batch of Canadian-made aircraft is now flying. In addition, large orders have been placed with the United States and Canada. Mr. Wood continued by mentioning civil aviation, saying that we have now jointly decided with Australia and New Zealand to link New Zealand with the Imperial air route, with weekly flights across the Tasman Sea starting in April. A powerful Civil Aviation Advisory Committee has been established to safeguard the status of civil aviation after the war. Mr. Wood also stated that he could assert that in the past twelve months, the strength of the British Air Force has increased by at least one hundred percent, and he firmly believes that even in terms of quantity, the aircraft production of Britain and France today exceeds that of Germany. Mr. Wood concluded by saying that we can be sure that the powerful and efficient air defense organization that has been established will inflict significant losses on the enemy. Our bomber fleet is prepared and able to inflict heavy blows on the enemy and will continue to do so frequently and without interruption. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

<h3>Two Air Battles Off the British Coast in One Day, One German Bomber Shot Down</h3>
<p>London - British and German aircraft engaged in two air battles off the British coast today. In the first incident, a German Heinkel bomber flying at an altitude of 8,000 meters was shot down into the sea by a British Spitfire fighter. In the second incident, two German Heinkel bombers engaged a group of British aircraft off the eastern coast of Britain and fled in panic after a brief exchange. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>The Hague - A German aircraft again attacked the Dutch steamer "Hansweert" in the North Sea today, dropping six or seven bombs, all of which landed near the ship. It then strafed the ship with machine guns, injuring one crew member. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>The Hague - According to a report from London last night, German aircraft again attacked ships off the southeastern coast of England. At 8:00 PM last night, six explosions and machine gun fire were heard on the southeastern coast of England. Coastal residents saw German aircraft in the sky. It is not yet known whether any British ships were sunk. (Haitong, 8th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Regarding the Reuters report that the British Air Force intruded into German territory on the nights of the 6th and 7th of this month, flying a distance of 1,600 kilometers, the official here has clarified that after investigation by the German responsible authorities, it has been confirmed that one British aircraft did fly in the far eastern border of Germany and fled towards Flensburg. Another "RAF" aircraft intruded into German northwestern airspace. All other aircraft were repelled by German aircraft near Heligoland. From this, the world can see that Britain must fly a long distance of 1,600 kilometers to achieve this kind of "military success." (Haitong, 8th)</p>

<h3>Living Panic in Beiping</h3>
<p>Beiping - The general attention of the city has shifted from political events to the economic situation. Even the central political conference to be held in Nanjing, which may decide the future political status of North China, has failed to attract attention and make people ignore the rapidly deteriorating food situation. Although the authorities are doing their best to remedy the situation, the current state of food for the people has all the signs of brewing a major tragedy. It is a miracle that the Chinese can still survive under these circumstances. According to recent figures, even the most frugal living expenses are twice as much as income. Therefore, there have been events similar to riots in Beiping recently. Food is either running out or being sold at exorbitant prices, or it is in the hands of hoarding profiteers. Countless old people, children, and women with pale faces often gather in front of grain stores, waiting to buy food, which is a truly tragic sight. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Health徵Gathering Medical Talents</h3>

Another batch, mostly self-employed doctors, is also being collected, but they are considered to be in the reserve. (United Press, 8th)</p>

Last night, insurance companies sent people to guard the fire site to prevent bandits from looting the unburned items. It is heard that most of the burned shops have fire insurance with foreign insurance companies, and the losses of various insurance companies are about 500,000 yuan. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<h3>Shantou Japanese Army Implements Political and Economic Offensive, Chinese Army Recently Closing in on Shantou City</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The war in eastern Guangdong has become increasingly tense recently. The Chinese army's Hong Zhi Zheng's unit attacked Nanao on the night of February 25, recovering the small islands of Haishan and Hongmen near Huanggang. More than 50 Japanese soldiers on the islands were all killed. Chenghai City was also stormed by the Chinese army's Li Shao Ru's team on the evening of the 26th, and all Japanese puppet institutions in the city were destroyed. On the 27th, they attacked Xiaopu Ouding, only 18 Chinese miles from Shantou City. From the 27th, shops in Shantou City were closed, and all traffic outside the city was cut off. Chaoan City has been surrounded by the Chinese army for many days, and news is unclear. On the 25th, Japanese warships covered speedboats carrying troops to harass Pengzhou Suotuo. Of the twelve speedboats that left, only eight returned to Shantou. The citizens were very excited to see this situation.</p>
<p>The Puppet Municipal Government Suddenly Appears</p>
<p>Shantou City only has a puppet local maintenance association, with Zhou Zhizhen as the puppet chairman. There are no other administrative organs. All the power in Shantou City is held by Japanese Consul Suetsugu Takai and Special Agent Saburo Omoto. It is difficult to justify itself from the perspective of international law when dealing with the United Kingdom and the United States as the master. On February 21, Prince Fushimi visited Shantou and appointed Zhou Zhizhen as the puppet mayor of Shantou. Zhou was flattered and posted a red paper notice on the 23rd, calling himself the mayor without explaining who appointed him from a higher authority. Under the puppet mayor, there are four bureaus: Public Security, Public Works, Finance, and Education. The candidates for the puppet bureau chiefs have not been determined, but Shantou is close to Taiwan, and the Governor of Taiwan and the Japanese Navy are not sympathetic to Zhou and are secretly排擠ing him.</p>
<p>All the Economy is Controlled</p>
<p>Because the Japanese army's military offensive failed, they changed to two strategies: political offensive and economic offensive. However, Zhou Zhizhen has no connection with Chaozhou and Shantou. Although he holds a puppet position, he has absolutely no effect on the political strategy. Therefore, the liaison officer of the Japanese Asia Development Board led a group of traitors and merchants to carry out an economic offensive. First, a number of smugglers were sent to Dapu and other places to establish a unified tax bureau. All ships must pay donations and receive flag protection before they can enter and leave the sea, otherwise they will be robbed. Fishing boats are limited to returning to shore on the same day. Every two担 of fresh fish caught are taxed one担. The entire Shantou fish market (Yongtai Street Wei Santai City) was occupied by the Japanese army and a "Shantou Fish Market Association" was established. Fish shops cannot sell fish, and fishing boats cannot privately own their fish. Ships loaded with fresh fish from all over the world must stop at the end of Yongtai Street. The Japanese side stipulates that 100 catties of fresh fish will only be given back 20 yuan. After buying it, the price is set at 5角 per catty. The association was established on March 1, and is operated by the Japan Fisheries Company and the Fukudai Company, with a capital of 50,000 Japanese military yen. The Chinese capital is 5,250 yuan from Hequan Wanji, and 500 yuan each from Yuanshunli, Haiquan, Sanshunquan, Lianqi, Deshun, Yongyuan, and Donghai. Guangwanyuan, Haifeng, Sanheli, Guangshun, and Yutai each occupy 250 yuan. The chairman is Japanese, and there is one Japanese and one Chinese director. The lower-level members are partners of the fish shop. From then on, vegetables, fresh fish, and pork are all controlled by the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in Zhangzhu, Yixing, Japanese Army Collects Copper and Iron in the Occupied Areas of Suzhou and Wuxi</h3>
<p>Changzhou Correspondence: Yixing is located in an important area. The Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway crosses the county. The county is surrounded by mountains, making it strategically important. Although the county seat has been occupied by the Japanese army, Zhangzhu and other towns have been controlled by the Chinese army for the past two years, and they attack at any time. Therefore, the county seat has been repeatedly won and lost. A few days ago, a war broke out with the Chinese army in Liyang, and they once rushed to the Tianwang Temple in Lishui. The Chinese army in Zhangzhu also fought with the Japanese army in Yixing. The artillery fire was fierce. The Japanese army used aircraft to bomb indiscriminately. The Chinese army defended by relying on the terrain. The fighting is still fierce. In the occupied areas of Suzhou, Wuxi, Wucheng, and other places, the Japanese army has been trying to collect waste copper and scrap iron. The ignorant people are only interested in profit. They sell whatever they get at a good price. For the past two years, they have been almost exhausted. Now the price of raw copper is 80 yuan per 担, and purple copper is 110 yuan, which is ten times higher than the market price before the war, but there is no spot货了.</p>
<h3>Ningxian County Government Limits the Export of Strong Young Men, Temporarily Suspends Issuance of Export Permits</h3>
<p>Ningbo Correspondence: The Ningxian County Government, because many strong young men of eligible age have recently applied for export in the name of handling goods, which will have a significant impact on conscription if this continues. Yesterday, County Chief Yu issued a notice to the processing office that the issuance of export permits for merchants will be temporarily suspended from the 27th. However, merchants coming to Ningbo from Shanghai who carry certificates from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce or the Hometown Association will be allowed to process them in a variable manner to restrict them.</p>
<h3>Suzhou's Electricity is Controlled by the Japanese, The Reason is the Lack of Fuel</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: The Suzhou Electric Plant in this county was founded by commercial capital. After the outbreak of the war, it was once suspended. Then it was forced to be taken over by the Japanese Huazhong Company and continued to operate. Recently, due to the lack of fuel, the Japanese have implemented control over electricity, and from March 1, they will first stop sending electricity to Japanese users. Users will not be allowed to turn on electric lights after 10 pm. As for the factory's electricity consumption, it is limited to no more than 4,400字 per month. There is also news that street lights will be stopped after 12 o'clock in the middle of the night.</p>
<h3>As Spring Approaches, Flooding in Northern Jiangsu is Concerning</h3>
<p>Huaiyin Correspondence: The dikes along the Grand Canal in Gaoyou, northern Jiangsu, have been damaged because the Chinese and Japanese armies have used them as a basis for digging and building fortifications. Flooding is feared when the peach blossom water rises in an instant. Originally, the design and estimation could be carried out during the winter when the water is dry, and construction could be carried out during the spring farm leisure to protect the lives and properties of millions of people in northern Jiangsu in summer and autumn. However, since the Japanese army invaded, the Chinese army has attacked from time to time, and there is no money for construction. Even if there is a design, it can only be suspended. Before the breach of the Yellow River in Zhongmu is blocked, it is planned to dredge the Zhangfu diversion river and block the Sanhe Dam as a preventive measure so that the Yellow River can flow into the sea. However, if the Zhangfu diversion river is dredged, the Zhongshan River must be opened at the same time, otherwise, even if the Sanhe Dam is blocked, the Hong Lake will inevitably overflow and harm Anhui Province. How can we bear to use neighboring provinces as ditches? If the Zhangfu and Zhongshan rivers are dredged at the same time, it is impossible to do so without huge sums of money. In the current situation, there is no such time. However, for the current emergency measures, if the east and west dikes of the canal are not repaired, the Gaoyou Canal dike will be in danger during this spring flood season.</p>
<h3>Shandong Japanese Army Abuses American僑, American僑Detained and Money Robbed</h3>
<p>The Qingdao correspondence of the English "American Evening News" on March 2 stated that since the first day of this year, several unfortunate incidents involving American 僑 have occurred in Shandong, which are briefly described as follows: (1) The Japanese authorities in Yixian County arrested a Chinese servant employed for many years by an American missionary in the area and executed him immediately. (2) According to visitors from Jinan, it is widely rumored that about half of the hundreds of teachers and students of the Taian American Church school who were arrested and taken to Jinan last month have been executed. The school has been closed, and it goes without saying that the teachers and students who were not arrested have fled Taian. (3) The Chinese chief of staff of the Qingdao American Consulate was arrested a few weeks ago and released after negotiation the next day. (4) American 僑Bailarock was carrying legal currency when he went out from HSBC Bank recently. He was arrested by a Japanese and a Chinese man in plain clothes. His hands were tied and he was taken to the Japanese naval patrol headquarters. Mr. Bai and his companions argued reasonably, claiming that they were American 僑. Only then was the rope untied, and then they continued to the naval headquarters. The American consul heard the news and negotiated. As a result, Mr. Bai was detained for a while, and then he retrieved the legal currency and was released. (5) American missionary Ms. Aikomp returned to India after vacationing in the United States and visited friends in North China on the way. A few days ago, when she landed in Qingdao, the Japanese officials took away her US$500 travel checks and the cash she carried with her. After the American consul negotiated, they were recovered.</p>

<h3>Overview of Compulsory Education Implementation in Jiangxi Province: One Compulsory School to be Established in Every 'Bao' (Unit) Except for Guerrilla Areas</h3>
<p>(Ji'an Correspondence)程柏庐, the Director of Education of Jiangxi Province, has been exceptionally diligent in promoting compulsory education. The number of schools established is the highest among all provinces. The Ministry of Education commended him before the war. The province's performance in compulsory education during wartime has been particularly noteworthy. Currently, apart from the overall statistics for the implementation of compulsory education in the 28th year of the Republic (1939), which are still difficult to obtain, the Sixth Administrative District alone has added over 1,000 schools. It is evident that achieving universal education throughout the province is not a difficult goal. The following is a summary of the actual implementation of compulsory education over the past four years:</p>
<p>Original Plan</p>
<p>There are 1.5 million school-age children in the province. Excluding those already in school, 1.25 million are out of school. The province has 25,000 'bao'. Starting from the 24th year of the Republic (1935), 4,000 elementary schools will be added each year, totaling 20,000 schools in five years, accommodating 1 million students. The existing 5,900 public and private elementary schools will add an average of 1,000 short-term elementary classes each year within five years, accommodating 250,000 students. Compulsory education in the province can gradually become universal.</p>
<p>Implementation Status</p>

<h3>Authorities of the Two Concessions to Cooperate in Suppressing and Stabilizing Prices; The French Concession to Host the Event in Three Groups; Market Situation Has Shown Improvement in Recent Days</h3>
<p>After the French Concession Public Works Bureau organized the Price Stabilization Committee on the 19th of the month, in order to smoothly assist in the progress, it held a meeting on the afternoon of the 7th to study the unresolved issues discussed by the subcommittee and conduct further research. The 工商學院局 (School of Commerce and Industry Bureau) also sent representatives to attend and participate. French Consul 欧仁 (Ō仁) and the Public Works Bureau representatives expressed their welcome and hoped that all parties would provide assistance to stabilize prices within the shortest possible time and ensure that it would be achieved. The following are letters to various parties:</p>
<p>Public Works Bureau Sends Representatives to Attend</p>
<p>The 字林部 (Chinese-English newspaper "North China Daily News") reported that the Public Works Bureau recently appointed Hong Ke and Mei Luo ·San (梅洛·三) to investigate the price issue. They attended the subcommittee meeting of the French Concession to investigate the market situation yesterday morning (the 7th). This is an auspicious sign that the authorities of the French Concession and the Common Concession will cooperate to address the high prices of goods within a limited time. Pei Si Tuo (裴司脱) and other three representatives of the Public Works Bureau attended the meeting, accompanied by officials from the bureau.</p>
<p>Close Cooperation to Alleviate People's Difficulties</p>
<p>欧仁, the French Consul General and Chairman of the Price Stabilization Committee of the French Concession, delivered a brief welcoming speech, briefly describing the work that the committee has been doing and stating the necessity of close cooperation between the two concessions to alleviate the people's difficulties. It is heard that the representatives of the Public Works Bureau attended the meeting to facilitate the preparation of a detailed report to be submitted to the Public Works Bureau. The details of yesterday's meeting were not disclosed, but it is roughly to discuss the current prices of goods.</p>
<p>Three Subcommittees Established, Each Responsible for Specific Tasks</p>
<p>According to 欧仁, the French Consul, who told reporters yesterday afternoon, the Price Stabilization Committee of the French Concession has conducted various inquiries on the market situation, and all the discussion materials required have been provided by the police department. In order to effectively solve the price problem, three subcommittees have now been established, namely: (1) The committee for investigating rice and grain, consisting of 社員·奇实· and Lu Juyi; (2) The committee for investigating coal, consisting of 杜克·金芝轩 and Yao Zhongban; (3) The committee for investigating the general retail market, consisting of 艾格尔·史洛波契柯夫 and Wan Molin.</p>
<p>Currently Collecting All Information</p>
<p>These three subcommittees are assisted by employees of the Public Works Bureau and the French police. After their recommendations are accepted by the全体委员会 (full committee) and approved by the French Consul General, they are currently collecting all the information necessary to set the highest price limit. 欧仁 then pointed out the difficulty of the problems to be solved by the committee. It is said that the cooperation of all the authorities is welcome to facilitate the task of stabilizing the market as much as possible so that the citizens can benefit from it.</p>
<p>Market Prices Slightly Lower Due to the Dissemination of Information</p>
<p>At the same time, the committee is carefully monitoring market actions. Since the committee began its work, the situation has improved. In the past few days, rice prices have eased slightly, falling by about 1.5 yuan per load. The committee is now making every effort to set the highest price limit in the shortest possible time, but if it is to be effective, the implementation of this extremely challenging plan will take some time.</p>
<p>The Right to Inspect Accounting Books and Documents</p>
<p>According to the order issued by the French consulate against those who speculate and hoard necessities, the established committee has the right to inspect the accounting books and other evidentiary documents of merchants in order to set the highest price limit to alleviate the difficulties encountered by citizens due to the exorbitant prices. On the one hand, it allows the owners to obtain reasonable profits. Violators will be fined up to 1,000 yuan. In some cases, the committee may also confiscate the goods.</p>
<h3>To Prevent Speculation and Hoarding: Increase the Interest Rate on Remittances; Noon Market Interbank Loan Interest Rate Also Restored; But the National Currency Interest Rate Remains Unchanged; Chinese and Foreign Banks Simultaneously Charge Custody Fees</h3>
<p>Before the war, financial institutions were scattered all over the country. After the war, they concentrated in the cities, especially in Shanghai. The credit position of each bank, which used to be distributed throughout the country, is now concentrated in Shanghai. Compared with the period between 1932 and 1933, the concentration of silver in Shanghai is even greater now. In the past, the credit position had various enterprises across the country as investment targets. Now, it is concentrated in one place, with only Shanghai as the center of investment. There is no place for legitimate investment, so it tends to speculation.</p>
<p>Speculative Trend Intense</p>
<p>Now, 銀錢 (silver and money shops), in view of the recent surge in speculation and hoarding, are raising interest rates to restrict it. Since March 2, the Bank Joint Reserve Committee has announced that the interbank loan interest rate for national currency is 0.28 fen per thousand yuan per day, the remittance rate is 0.23 fen per thousand yuan per day, the discount rate for 90-day acceptance drafts is 0.28 fen per thousand yuan per day, the remittance rate is 0.23 fen per thousand yuan per day, and the interest rate for interbank remittances is 0.2 fen per thousand yuan. The overdue interest on interbank remittance loans made by various peers to the association has been changed to 0.25 fen per thousand yuan per day.</p>
<p>Increase Interest Rates</p>
<p>According to the above interest rates, compared with February 1, the national currency interest rate has not changed, and the remittance rates have increased by 0.05 fen. The association has set the interest rate for interbank remittance deposits in February at 3.5 yuan per thousand yuan (i.e., a monthly interest rate of 3.5%). The interest rate for loans from money shops has been increased from 10.05 yuan per thousand yuan per day to 12 yuan. Due to the large number of interbank bill transactions in the market, the noon market interbank loan interest rate has been restored since March 1.</p>
<p>Charging Fees</p>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Industry Association and the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Banking Association have also decided on measures to restrict speculation and charge custody and withdrawal fees. The measures are recorded as follows: It has been decided by the joint meeting of the two associations that all member banks should charge custody and withdrawal fees for various property documents held in custody or with a lien on behalf of customers in accordance with the following regulations: (1) Stocks and bonds: For each withdrawal of the above-mentioned valuable securities, the handling fee is 0.125% of the market price for securities with a value of less than 10,000 yuan. For those exceeding 100,000 yuan, the handling fee is increased by 0.0625% for the excess amount, regardless of the amount. The minimum handling fee is one yuan. (2) For entrusting the custody of land contracts and leases (excluding those used as loan mortgages), as well as boxes, packages, wills, insurance policies, and other documents, whether valued or sealed, a custody fee of 5 yuan per year or less than one year will be charged (paid in advance).</p>
<p>Conditions for Exemption</p>
<p>(Note): A. Customers who come to apply for inspection or temporary withdrawal of various securities in accordance with the following conditions will not be charged an additional handling fee: (1) Those who apply for inspection or temporary withdrawal no more than once every three months (cannot be accumulated); (2) Those who do not change the contents recorded on the custody receipt; (3) Those who return the original item to the bank within 24 hours of temporary withdrawal. Customers who violate the above conditions may be deemed by the bank to have withdrawn the stored item. B. The handling fees stipulated in this regulation do not apply to the following property documents: (1) Valuable securities used as collateral for interbank loans; (2) Deposit documents issued by the bank itself; (3) Items held in custody on behalf of the government; (4) Items held in custody on behalf of charitable organizations or religious groups; (5) Items held in custody by the bank in the capacity of trustee or executor.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Was International Women's Day: The Women's Community Celebrated Vigorously; Enduring Hardships and Shouldering the Responsibilities of the Times; Correcting Extravagant and Wasteful Lifestyles</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the International Women's Day. The women's community in this city, due to the current national crisis, did not hold extravagant celebration ceremonies, but only held gatherings and meals separately to commemorate the occasion. Women from all walks of life are generally aware of the responsibilities that women should bear in this great era. They are determined to liberate themselves with the spirit of enduring hardships and strive for the survival of the nation and the race. In view of the abnormal prices and the suffering of disaster victims, they will unanimously promote the frugality and disaster relief movement. They will make every effort to correct the extravagant and wasteful lifestyles of some women in order to strengthen and establish the status of women in society.</p>
<h3>Japanese Information Department Sends Personnel to Conduct Activities in This City</h3>
<p>It is reported that the Japanese Cabinet Information Department has specially sent four members, namely Kataoka Seiichi, Ishii Ryoichi, Nishisaka Fumio, and Imai, who arrived in Shanghai on the Shanghai Maru on the 8th and will leave Shanghai for Ningbo on the 11th, and then go to Qingdao, Tianjin, Beiping, and Mongolia. It is heard that their task is to collect a variety of information for reference by the Japanese Cabinet Information Department.</p>
<h3>Singapore Authorities Improve Treatment of Chinese Merchants; The Order Prohibiting the Import of Goods from Non-Sterling Bloc Has Been Revised; But Only Applicable to Chinese Merchants</h3>
<p>According to news from the National Products Community in this city, after the Singapore authorities issued the Financial Defense Ordinance prohibiting the import of goods from non-sterling areas, Singapore and other regions felt greatly hindered. Therefore, merchants in the area submitted petitions to the local government, urging improvements. After the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce re-submitted a request to the Singapore government to improve this prohibition, the local Financial Supervisor has agreed to revise the measures.</p>
<p>Chinese Traders Can Continue to Trade</p>
<p>After this ordinance is implemented in the future, the tens of millions of dollars of business between Singapore and various regions can continue to trade. When these newly revised measures are implemented in the future, they will still be subject to the local foreign exchange control. It is heard that the authorities have agreed to start registering the shops and shipping companies in the area. At the same time, in order to reduce the obstacles to trade in various regions here caused by the Financial Ordinance promulgated in 1939 and to maintain the principle of foreign exchange control, the local Foreign Exchange Control Department has formulated flexible measures. According to another report, merchants from various countries trading in Singapore include Chinese, Malays, and Arabs. However, these newly revised measures only apply to Chinese merchants.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Engaging in Business Must Register</p>
<p>In these measures, the transaction is limited to 5,000 yuan, but it is limited to Singapore and the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, Vietnam, and various ports in China. There are currently 156 Singapore Chinese merchants registered with the authorities. In the future, the number will reach more than 500. The new measures are divided into two parts: For Chinese merchants engaged in commerce, all commercial requests must be notified to the secretary of the local Chinese Chamber of Commerce and then forwarded to the Financial Supervisor. For shipping companies from other places coming to and from Singapore, all registered Chinese merchants must have their export trade registered in the department for presentation to the authorities. If there is any violation of the law, the authorities can cancel their registered name.</p>
<h3>Changes in Import Restrictions</h3>
<p>A certain national goods organization in this city received a letter yesterday from Mr. Li Xiaoyan, manager of the Singapore Chinese National Goods Company, reporting on recent changes in Singapore regarding the import of foreign goods (referring to goods from non-gold standard countries). The report was quite detailed, and excerpts are as follows: The original letter stated, "Since the Singapore government issued its second set of control regulations on the import of national goods, dividing them into restrictions and prohibitions, applying for import permits has become quite difficult. The application for prohibited goods was announced to be suspended at the end of last year. On the 19th of this month, it was further announced that thirty types of restricted goods will be</p>
<p>Temporarily Suspended from Import.</p>
<p>The application stated, "(1) Orders for the following restricted import goods (listing their numbers and descriptions as listed in the gazette notification) (referred to as AP forms, i.e., restricted goods application forms), such requests will never be accepted. (2) The reason for this measure is due to the large number of CP forms (i.e., prohibited goods application forms) placed on November 18, 1939, or requests for approval after that date for AP forms that have already been submitted and approved. The appropriate date for prior applications for textiles imported from Hong Kong is December 28, 1939. (3) It is known that some applications have been cancelled later, or the actual orders according to the AP form permit are not approved for various reasons. Please promptly report them to the Import Control Department, along with copies of the related AL or CL forms, for reference, which will be of great assistance to importers in the future. (4) If there are indeed difficulties for special importers, then there is a request for</p>
<p>Exemption from Restrictions.</p>
<p>Such suggestions will be considered, and the criteria for decisions will often depend on the applicant of the CL and AP forms stating the average import figures of special goods within four months in 1938. Also, whether the number of items imported by the applicant since December 1, 1939, does not exceed the average import number during the corresponding period in 1938. These suggestions will be discussed on or after March 1, 1940, and must be accompanied by the so-called numerical evidence. (5) It is pointed out that there are a large number of orders that have been requested or ordered for almost all the remaining goods on the restricted import goods list (referring to the forty-six types of goods other than the thirty types). It is intended to take the same approach of stopping the application of AP forms for these goods as well." However, according to the explanation of the Restriction Import Control Officer, the goods in the restricted import list can continue to be imported into Malaya in the future, but only after the current high volume of orders is absorbed and reduced proportionally to the amount normally required by Malaya will they be allowed again. Therefore, manufacturers in Shanghai should still strive for the excellence of their products in order to achieve sales and not be discouraged," (The following is omitted, and the current temporary suspension of import applications applies to)</p>
<p>List of Goods</p>
<p>Details are listed on the left: (1) Other manufactured grains, (2) Other meats, (3) Canned sardines, (4) Dried fruits and preserved fruits, (5) Onions, (6) Brandy, (7) Spirits (foreign-made), (8) Distilled liquor (including medicinal liquor) with a standard alcohol content not exceeding 26%, (9) Depressed porcelain ware (such as cooking and household utensils), (10) Tinplate, (11) Copper and copperware, (12) Flashlights and batteries, (13) Gray unbleached cotton cloth bolts, (14) Bleached cloth bolts, (15) Dyed cloth bolts, (16) Printed cloth bolts (including woven sarongs), (17) Cloth bolts with woven colored fabric, (18) Cotton sarongs, (19) Rayon cloth bolts, (20) Rayon sarongs, (21) Leather shoes and boots, (22) Cloth and rayon overcoats, (23) Rayon underwear, (24) Cloth underwear, (25) Other types of printing paper, (26) Other paper materials and paper products, (27) Bicycle accessories, (28) Rockets and other fireworks products, (29) Incense sticks and joss paper, (30) Other types of cosmetics.</p>

<h3>General Manager Candidate: Archibald Rose Receives Popular Support; Over One Hundred American Citizens Sign Recommendations</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press", the recommendation of American lawyer Archibald Rose as a candidate for General Manager of the Shanghai Municipal Council by American citizens in this city has been enthusiastic. Therefore, Rose's name will be submitted to the American Association this afternoon (the 8th). Only the signatures of ten American taxpayers are required for recommendation, but over one hundred people signed the proposal last night (the 7th). It is expected that this number will double today. It is understood that there are only two seats for American candidates. Now that there are three candidates, MacDonald, Cornell, and Rose, unless one of them withdraws, the American Association will hold a preliminary election next week to select two of them. However, judging from the current situation, it seems that none of the three, including MacDonald, intend to withdraw.</p>

<h3>Ethical Society Urges: Abstain from Smoking, Alcohol, Gambling, and Prostitution; Indulgence Invariably Drains Wealth and Harms the Body; We Must Strive to Serve Society and the Nation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Ethical Society has issued a proclamation to the citizens urging them to abstain from smoking, alcohol, gambling, and prostitution, to invigorate their spirits, and to serve society and the nation. The proclamation states, "Citizens of all walks of life, in this day of exorbitant prices and high cost of living, it is difficult to cope with extraordinary expenses, not to mention the poor citizens, even the middle and upper classes often feel financially strained. Therefore, to overcome this difficult situation, the only way is to practice thrift, reduce material enjoyment, and save on unnecessary consumption. 'Smoking, alcohol, gambling, and prostitution' are the most harmful among consumer goods. They are described separately below:</p>
<p>Smoking</p>
<p>contains nicotine, a toxic substance. Prolonged smoking can damage the brain's nervous system and affect physical health. This refers to cigarettes. As for opium, morphine, heroin, etc., their toxicity is even more severe. Occasional smoking can invigorate the spirit, but once addicted, it is not easy to quit. Indulging in it will render one useless in everything, eventually leading to emaciation, spiritual exhaustion, and resembling a ghost, despised by others.</p>
<p>Alcohol</p>
<p>is not as harmful as smoking, but prolonged drinking can also lead to nervous weakness. Instances of causing trouble due to alcohol are numerous, and instances of making mistakes due to alcohol are also often heard. Moreover, the price of alcohol is affected by commodity prices and continues to increase. The raw materials for expensive alcohol are mostly foreign goods, and the annual leakage amounts to tens of millions of dollars. In terms of wartime economy, it is still a significant loss to the country.</p>
<p>The harm of prostitution</p>
<p>is known to all. Looking at those who frequently visit brothels, it is not uncommon for them to lose their lives due to excessive loss of energy, and the waste of money is a minor matter. At this time of resisting aggression and building the nation, we should all strive to serve the country. How can we indulge in sensual pleasures?</p>
<p>Opening the newspaper every day,</p>
<p>one often sees countless suicide news stories. The reason for suicide mostly stems from gambling debts and economic pressure. Gambling is a matter that wastes time and money on a small scale and leads to bankruptcy on a large scale. Although it is sometimes done as a game, people often fall into this path and are like falling into a trap, indulging in it day and night, hoping for luck. As a result, they have no intention to work, and those who have jobs abandon them. After abandoning their jobs, they willingly engage in despicable acts, which is truly heartbreaking. From this, it can be seen that smoking, alcohol, gambling, and prostitution are indeed the great enemies of us today. It is hoped that those who are addicted to these habits will initially reduce their quantity and frequency, and then completely abstain from them. This will not only lead to the happiness of individual future prospects but also the dawn of the nation's future.</p>
<h3>Japanese Patrolmen Beat a Chinese Man to Death at the Intersection of Jinling Road in Zhabei</h3>
<p>Yesterday at around 1 PM, three Japanese navy patrolmen were at the intersection of Datong Road and Jinling Road in Zhabei. They encountered two Chinese men dressed in short clothes, resembling coolies. For unknown reasons, this angered the Japanese soldiers, who struck them with rifle butts and wooden sticks, kicked them with leather shoes, and threw the two men onto the road, hitting them for about half an hour. The two Chinese men died immediately. The Japanese soldiers were still not satisfied and struck them with wooden sticks several more times before leaving. There were many onlookers along the road at the time, but no one could do anything.</p>
<h3>Salvaging the Sunken Jingsheng Steamer: The Work Is Difficult; The Ship Is Heavy, The Water Is Deep, and Mud Has Seeped In</h3>
<p>Since last year, the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai has been making every effort to provide relief to the victims in the Ningbo area. Last year's fundraising for the Ningbo disaster was particularly active. Now, in response to the tragic capsizing of the Jingsheng steamer and the plight of those awaiting relief, it has issued another appeal for donations to provide relief to the distressed passengers and handle all the aftermath.</p>
<p>Starting the Salvage</p>
<p>After the Jingsheng steamer capsized, the sunken ship drifted to the bottom of the river at the entrance of the Sanjiangkou North Peace Association in Zhenhai due to the impact of rapid tides. Ten divers hired from Shanghai have already arrived in Ningbo by barge and have begun to measure and salvage the sunken ship. However, the water depth in that area reaches over twenty fathoms, and due to the intrusion of mud at the bottom of the river, the ship's compartments have three levels, and the ship's body is heavy, so there is no hope of lifting it out of the water for the time being.</p>
<p>Handling the Aftermath</p>
<p>Since the Ningbo-based Aftermath Committee began its work, it has been extremely busy. The committee has now moved all the recovered bodies to the Siming Guildhall on Xinwei Road to await identification. It has also set aside the time from 2 PM to 4 PM daily to handle matters related to claiming lost items. Donations from all walks of life in Shanghai and Ningbo to provide relief are also quite enthusiastic. Yesterday, it continued to receive donations of 10,000 yuan from Hefeng Cotton Mill and others to handle the aftermath.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council Library Receives Famous Italian Works: The History of the Italian Army Since the Roman Empire</h3>
<p>Mr. Nielone, the Italian Consul General in Shanghai, recently presented the complete yearbook compiled by the Army Department of the Italian government to the Shanghai Municipal Council Library on behalf of Colonel Polin Scheibina, the military attaché of the Italian Embassy in China. This book details the history of the Italian army from the Roman Empire era to the present day. The Shanghai Municipal Council has sent a letter to Mr. Nielone expressing its gratitude.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Budget for This Year: Health Department, Section A: Temporary Expenditures</h3>
<p>The draft temporary expenses for the Health Department totaled 122,800 yuan. After item-by-item review by the Health Committee, 184,600 yuan was deducted. The necessary uses included construction fees for the unfinished portions of the abattoir, fees for adding tap water faucets to the Hongkou vegetable market, and fees for paving gutters and sidewalks in the Jing'an Temple and Hongqiao cemeteries, etc., totaling 28,200 yuan.</p>
<p>The following items were resolved not to be spent this year: (1) Land for a proposed vegetable market in the West District, about 2 mu, 80,000 yuan; (2) Addition of cemetery land in the Hongqiao Cemetery, 85,000 yuan; (3) Addition of fences and walkways in the Hongqiao Cemetery, 7,400 yuan; (4) Construction of dormitories and coffin sheds in the Luo Bie Gen Crematorium, 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The largest increase among the various recurring expenses was the expenses of the Chinese Isolation Hospital, with an increase of 413,800 yuan. Subsequently, the director of the Health Department decided to temporarily suspend the Xinza Road branch of the Chinese Isolation Hospital.</p>
<p>The reason for the increase in recurring expenses this year is nothing more than the increase in temporary living allowances for staff and the rise in the prices of various daily necessities and utilities. In addition, there is no additional revenue projected for this year. As for the surplus from rice sales, the bureau will make every effort to ensure that the subsidy is used in the most effective way for public health.</p>
<p>The above budgets have been reviewed and approved by the Health Committee, and the draft budget for recurring expenditures originally listed 2,782,250 yuan, which is 893,600 yuan more than the previous year. The breakdown is as follows for comparison. After multiple efforts to reduce other expenditures, the total amount of the recurring expenses budget was changed to 2,423,260 yuan. The breakdown is as follows for comparison. Allocations and other reasons are also contributing factors. As for the subsidy, this subsidy is usually listed under the "Health Team" section of the budget, as customary. The amount to be allocated this year cannot be determined at present. The following items are of a trial nature and were passed at a meeting on February 16. Except for necessary adjustments by the heads of the Finance and Health Departments, they will be submitted to the Finance Committee for review.</p>
<h3>Intimidation Case at a Bean Curd Shop: Complicated Inside Story; Chairman of the Bean Curd Industry Association and Others Arrested; Also Involves the Clerk of Lawyer Landon; Police Lawyer Investigates and Files Charges</h3>
<p>The Qia Xing Qi bean curd shop at 414 Avenue Edward VII recently experienced intimidation and other issues. Two suspects were arrested and sentenced to four months of imprisonment by the Special Court. Afterward, the Xinzha Police Station suddenly received a letter from British lawyer Landon, stating that Hua Detective No. 232 of the police station, Yang Fusheng, was sheltering the above-mentioned criminals and requesting that he be transferred.</p>
<p>The letter was affixed with the names and chops of five bean curd shops. Hua Detective Ding Huaguo and Western Detective Li Te started the investigation. They first investigated the five named bean curd shops. According to the shops, the seals were indeed those of the shops, but the secretary of the Bean Curd Industry Association, Bao Qirui, instructed them to stamp the seals, and there was not a single word on the paper. Therefore, they did not foresee the accusations against Detective Yang beforehand. It is suspected that they were added later. After Detective Ding conducted a</p>
<p>Detailed Investigation,</p>
<p>it was determined that the letter was colluded and forged by the chairman of the Bean Curd Industry Association, Xu Taoqing (a Shanghainese residing at 13 Guangxi Road, operating three bean curd shops), and the secretary, Bao Qirui. Consequently, Xu and Bao were arrested and sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Special First Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted them for</p>
<p>forging documents</p>
<p>under Article 217 of the Criminal Law and for false accusations under Article 169. Xu and others confessed that a clerk named Lu of Landon Law Firm instructed them to stamp blank letterhead. At the time, he said that the court's sentence for the criminals in the Qia Xing Qi case was too lenient and that they were preparing to appeal. They had not seen the text in advance. After Judge Xiao Peishen reviewed the confession, he ordered that the hearing be rescheduled for one week later.</p>

<h3>Large-Scale Tuberculosis Prevention Campaign to Begin in Mid-Month</h3>
<p>Since Shanghai became an isolated island, the surge in population and the poor living conditions have led to an increasingly rampant invasion and spread of tuberculosis.

<h3>It Is Reported That Shanghai-Ningbo Ships Have Decided to Increase Freight Rates Again; It Has Been Submitted to the Authorities for Review; Ordered to Compile Statistics</h3>
<p>Foreign ships operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, due to the continuous increase in coal prices and rising costs, had previously increased freight rates to compensate for losses. According to a recent inquiry from a "New Voice" reporter to the shipping industry, various shipping companies have recently determined that, due to the skyrocketing price of coal, which is many times higher than in the past, and the fact that Shanghai-Ningbo ships have to wait outside Zhenhai for transshipment, resulting in significant delays, with the longest delays exceeding one month, not only increasing consumption but also reducing revenue due to delays, they have decided to increase freight rates again. The various shipping companies jointly discussed this matter last month and formulated the following measures: (1) General cargo will be increased by 100% of the original freight rate. (2) Small cargo will be increased by 50%. These measures have been submitted to the Ningbo authorities for review. However, it is understood that the authorities believe that these measures are not yet appropriate and that a comprehensive plan should be developed from all sides to achieve a balance between the interests of shipowners and cargo owners. The shipping companies have been notified to compile detailed statistics on the recent voyages of their ships, such as the longest and shortest number of days, and the amount of revenue and expenditure on fares and freight rates, and submit them for review. Then, the Ningbo Shipping Management Office will convene relevant agencies to discuss and decide with the various shipping companies. The companies are now rushing to compile statistics so that a solution can be decided soon.</p>
<h3>Coal Briquette Certificate Holders Should Respect the Time Limit for Delivery; Those Who Exceed the Time Limit Should Be Punished; Those Who Exceed the Price Limit Will Be Warned</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Briquette Industry Association held a joint meeting of factories at its Tianjin Road headquarters yesterday afternoon, attended by representatives from over ten factories, including Yi Taixing, Nanyang, and Guohua. Chairman Chen Cuifang discussed: (1) The Coal Briquette Certificate was previously announced by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in conjunction with this association, with a deadline of February 15 for delivery. According to reports from various member factories, many certificate holders have come to the factory to take delivery within the deadline, but there are also many who are taking a wait-and-see approach. How should this be handled? Please decide. It was resolved: (A) From now until the 11th, a notice will be published in the newspaper again, advising certificate holders to come to the factory to register and complete the delivery procedures. (B) After the deadline, in accordance with the methods agreed upon by the public organizations and chambers of commerce, the factories will copy and submit the names of the certificate holders to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for disposition. (2) The original agreement for exchanging coal briquettes for coal scraps at an 80% discount is now inconsistent among the factories. How should this be rectified? It was resolved: From now on, the exchange will be made at an 80% discount from the time the truck arrives at the factory. The meeting adjourned at around 6 PM. In addition, the Xiangtai Coal Company on Laobeimen Street in the French Concession sold coal briquettes at a price exceeding the limit. After the purchaser attached an invoice and reported it to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber of Commerce immediately sent a letter to the Coal Industry Association for warning. It is now reported that the Coal Industry Association has already sent a letter of warning, stating that the publicly set price limit must be observed in the future and must not be exceeded.</p>

<h3>Stolen Jewelry Case: Still No Clues</h3>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, between 6 PM and 9 PM on the 2nd of this month, when Madame Dunbaie, a guest at the El Dorado Apartments on Avenue Albert, was out watching a movie, jewelry worth 158,000 yuan was stolen from her apartment. Detectives from the French Concession Police were summoned, and the investigation began that night. Six days have passed, but the detectives handling the case still have no clues to investigate. The thieves entered the apartment without breaking any doors or windows, and there were no fingerprints found. Apart from the small safe in Madame Dunbaie's trunk containing the jewels being stolen, nothing else was lost in the apartment. The thieves acted quietly when committing the theft and did not arouse any suspicion from other residents of the apartment. It is believed that there were several thieves, and they must have known Madame Dunbaie's movements in detail; otherwise, they would probably not have entered the apartment at that time. On the 6th of this month, two suits of clothes were found in a nearby trash can and have been handed over to the police, but it is not yet known whether the two suits of clothes are related to the theft.</p>

A pistol and four bullets were seized. The coat he was wearing was the original stolen item belonging to Zhu Jincheng. He also called Hua Police No. 2728, who arrested Wang A'gen and seized the original stolen gold watch. Only "Little Three" escaped. The injured robber was sent to the hospital for treatment.

<h3>Finance: Forward Foreign Exchange - Trend Somewhat Looser</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in the official rates of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC). The unofficial market for British and American currencies remained stable. A slight loosening trend was observed amidst the quiet, but the outcome was the same as the closing rate of the day before yesterday. The morning began with the overseas exchange rates for American and British currencies continuing to report gains of 2.375, leading to a weakening of British and American currencies at the opening, with prices at 4.125 and 6.75 respectively. Subsequently, the market became calm, with little activity. It was not until after 9:30 AM that speculators slightly closed out their long positions in American currency for this month. At the same time, foreign banks also showed willingness to sell. As a result, the American currency briefly strengthened, with the loosest rate being an interbank transaction at 6.78125. Then, as foreign firms slightly remitted funds, the situation stabilized. By the noon close, the rates remained at 4.125 and 6.75. However, the April American currency rate slightly hardened. The afternoon situation remained quite stagnant. Although the British-American Tobacco Company and the Bank of Japan attempted to acquire currencies, foreign banks were willing to supply them, so there was no impact. By the evening close, the British and American currency rates were the same as the morning opening rates, resulting in a gain of 0.02125 for British currency and a loss for American currency compared to the previous day. The potential trend of futures was not much different from the spot rate, with only the April American currency rate appearing slightly firmer than the spot rate.</p>
<p>Some Long Positions Settled This Month</p>
<p>The morning began with London rates rising by 0.0625 for both near-term and long-term contracts. The New York silver price remained stable. London spot gold exchange rates for British currency against American currency and French currency remained unchanged, while against Shanghai, it contracted by 0.0625. The American currency rose by 2.375 against British currency, remained unchanged against Shanghai, and rose by 1.375 against French currency. The central bank's official rates for various currencies remained the same. The morning opening selling price for spot currency by banks was 4.25 for British gold and 6.75 for American currency, a flat rate for British currency and a loss of 0.03125 for American currency compared to the previous closing rate, due to the increase in exchange rates. At the same time, the opening rates for futures also showed a flat rate for British currency and a gain of 0.02125 for American currency. After the opening, the market was quiet, with little activity. When HSBC announced that the official rates would not change and the silver balance tax was announced to increase by 0.25, speculators slightly sold off their positions. At the same time, foreign banks also showed willingness to sell futures, so the market trend was slightly firmer amidst stability. It is estimated that speculators sold American currency for this month to HSBC at 6.75. At the same time, a certain bank acquired spot American currency from a foreign bank at 6.78125. At that time, American currency for this month at 6.7875 and American currency for the next month at 6.625 could be purchased. Then, foreign firms suddenly settled their positions by selling British gold for May at 4.015625 to Macgarry and other foreign banks and acquiring spot American currency from Huabi, Youli, a certain bank, and others at 6.75, which made the situation more stable. However, foreign banks trading futures remained willing to sell, so there was a further slight strengthening. At the noon close, British gold was at 4.125 and American currency was at 6.75, with no change compared to the morning opening rates. The only change in futures was that the April American currency rate was slightly higher by 0.03125 compared to the morning opening rate.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Market Was Quite Quiet</p>
<p>The afternoon market was initially quite quiet. Later, although the British-American Tobacco Company slightly remitted funds and the Bank of Japan also attempted to acquire currencies, HSBC was willing to maintain British gold at 4.125, and other foreign banks were also willing to supply at the same price, so there was no change. By the close, British gold was at 4.125, American currency was at 6.75, British gold for this month was at 4.109375, American currency for this month was at 6.71875, British gold for the next day was at 4.0625, and American currency was at 6.625.

<h3>Tianjin Banks Repeatedly Sold Off, Gold Market Returned to Slump</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market re-entered a slump. Although Hong Kong banks bought a total of 4-5,000 taels in the middle of the day, the Tianjin banks repeatedly sold off, and individual long position holders also sold off at limited prices because they were burdened by high interest rates and saw no profit. As a result, the market fell again. The morning opening was 15 yuan lower, at 4,780 yuan. Later, a certain gold shop made purchases on behalf of Hong Kong banks, and securities firms also bought in, so the market once rebounded to 4,790 yuan. A certain money exchange firm then fiercely sold off on behalf of Tianjin banks, and a certain bank also sought to sell. At the same time, the foreign exchange market slightly hardened, so the price was pushed down to 4,760 yuan. Later, as the foreign exchange rate stabilized and the selling pressure eased, Hong Kong banks took the opportunity to buy again, so by the noon close, the market had returned to 4,774 yuan. Afternoon trading was quiet, and the situation was slightly stable. The result was a gain of 2 yuan, with the closing price at 4,776 yuan, which was 10 yuan lower than the previous day. Total trading volume was about 1,700-1,800 taels. Jewelry gold remained stable, and customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Fell 19 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, the initial market situation for spot gold (per 10 taels) was weak. A certain money exchange firm and gold shop competed to push down the price, so the opening price was reduced by 15 yuan. The gold shop conducted interbank transactions for 50 taels at 4,780 yuan. Shortly after, Hong Kong banks, seeing the price was low, commissioned a certain gold shop to buy in. At the same time, securities firms also bought in on behalf of clients. In an instant, the price rose by 10 yuan. The securities firm bought in 30 taels from the money exchange firm at 4,770 yuan. Later, because Hong Kong banks stopped buying and a certain bank suddenly started selling forcefully, and the money exchange firm continued to sell off on behalf of Tianjin banks, the market fell sharply by 30 yuan. The bank sold 20 taels to the money exchange firm, retreating to 4,760 yuan. Subsequently, Hong Kong banks took the opportunity to buy again at a low price. At that time, foreign exchange rates stabilized, and gold shops and securities firms also followed suit and bought in, so the market rebounded by 16 yuan. A certain jewelry shop bought in 30 taels from a fellow shop at 4,776 yuan. Near the closing time, a certain bank sold off 40 taels to the securities firm at 4,774 yuan, setting the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the initial opening was slightly lower by 1 yuan. The gold shop sold 20 taels to the securities firm for 4,773 yuan. After this, a certain bank suddenly bought in, and the money exchange firm also made purchases, so the market gradually rose by 7 yuan. The securities firm sold 30 taels to a certain bank for 4,780 yuan. Afterwards, the money exchange firm came to sell off, retreating by 4 yuan. The jewelry shop sold 10 taels to the securities firm for 4,776 yuan, setting the evening closing price. As a result, the market fell by 19 yuan compared to the previous day, with a daily fluctuation of 30 yuan. The cash price for gold sold by the current gold shops was a few yuan higher than the spot gold price, while the buying price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current price for standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there was little activity.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Remained Stable</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael remained stable. Datonghang remained at 485 yuan, and Xinhanghang was the same as the above price. The buying price was reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>British and American Currencies Softened</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currencies saw a slight abundance of supply for British and American gold pounds, and the market was soft. The supply of British and American gold notes was relatively strong, and the market price was weak. In the morning, it once fell to 14.6 yuan. Later, demand increased, and the market price rose slightly. The evening rate was 14.63 yuan. Philippine notes followed the trend of softening, while Japanese gold notes remained stable.

The interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association was quoted at 0.15 for both the morning and afternoon markets, with no change.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Bonds and Foreign Shares - Trading Was Scarce - Kung Ho &amp; Co. Announced Dividend</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities market remained in a sluggish state. Both long and short positions settled and exchanged types of transactions, with few new transactions. Although major players appeared, the market price did not decline as a result, as there were always those who took the opportunity to cover their short positions. The long positions hoped that loans would be established and the market would be firm, while the short positions feared that rumors from Nanjing would come true and did not cover. The mutual accusations led to greater stability. Yesterday morning, Xinfu was mostly sold, followed by No. 38. The rest were scattered individual investors. On the buying side, Tongkang acquired Class B, Dafeng and Gongmao acquired Class A, Jiufeng slightly recovered, and Hongkang, Taikang, and Lianyi all had demand. Market prices were slightly weaker. In the afternoon, Jiufeng and Dafeng switched from buying to selling, No. 38 switched from selling to buying, Tongkang continued to acquire Class B, Lianyi continued to buy, and Dingkang also had an appetite to buy. Market prices slightly turned firm and stable. The result was mixed highs and lows, but still only a difference of 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. The total transaction volume was about 400,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>---|---|---|---|---</p>
<p>Unified Class A | 57.05 | 56.95 | 57.05 | Down 0.05</p>
<p>Unified Class B | 50.35 | 50.15 | 50.30 | Flat</p>
<p>Unified Class C | 48.40 | 48.25 | 48.35 | Flat</p>
<p>Unified Class D | 47.25 | - | 47.25 | Down 0.10</p>
<p>Unified Class E | 47.80 | 47.70 | 47.80 | Up 0.05</p>
<p>Stock trading: 40 shares of Zhoucha Bank were traded at a price of 20 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's stock market at the Public Brokers' Association saw scarce trading, but the stabilizing trend that began on Thursday has not wavered. Although the public was interested in stocks such as Gangye, Jardine Matheson, Shanghai Banking Corporation, and Yangzi Banking Corporation, there was no increase in prices. The price of raw rubber has hardly changed recently, so the rubber stock market was also bleak.</p>
<p>According to news from Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government intends to levy taxes on corporate profits. This may also be a reason why the market has not been stable temporarily. However, in practice, this measure does not affect various foreign companies in this city that operate in accordance with the Chinese Company Law (although many of these companies are registered in Hong Kong) or impose this burden on merchants.</p>
<p>Kung Ho &amp; Co., managed by Jardine Matheson, announced that it will hold the annual shareholders' meeting on March 17. The board of directors also decided to pay a final dividend of 24 yuan per share in national currency for 1939, in addition to the interim dividend of 10 yuan per share in national currency that was already paid on August 30 of last year, for a total of 34 yuan in national currency per share for the whole year.</p>
<p>London, 7th (Thursday) dispatch, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt in London have returned to stability, with no ups and downs for bonds of any grade.</p>
<p>London, 7th (Thursday) dispatch, the listed prices of stocks of British Far East companies in London were generally stable today. Only the unregistered shares of the Kaiping Mining Company rose by 3 pence to 18 shillings and 3 pence.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Longs and Shorts Wait and See, Yarn Market Hovering</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm and does not deviate from the hovering situation. Both long and short positions are holding a wait-and-see attitude. However, in reality, although there are no large transactions in the South China region, sporadic purchases continue uninterrupted, so the market situation is stable. However, some have a higher base and are less interested in trading. However, raw materials remain firm and cannot be relaxed. The closing price for 20-count Shuangma yarn for March was 913 yuan.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened this morning with a tighter atmosphere. The price for 20-count Shuangma yarn for March was 914 yuan. As soon as this price opened, buyers were not strong, and scalpers were seen selling. The market hovered and declined to 907 yuan. After hearing that the foreign exchange market was quiet and there were no major changes, it rebounded to 912 yuan. According to half-day transaction statistics, 1,625 bales were traded. The spot price for 20-count Shuangma yarn fell by 3 yuan. The factory price for 20-count Shuangma Globe yarn opened by Xinyu Factory was 820 yuan in cash for 1,200 bales. Today, 15 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each bank is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 565  Sichuan: 30</p>
<p>Inland: 40  Fellow Dealers: 990</p>
<p>Total: 1,625</p>
<p>Local Cotton Prices Are Rising Daily</p>
<p>Local cotton trading is still dominated by inter-dealer buying and selling, mostly fire-damaged bales and white bales. Factory demand has not improved, but the sentiment is exceptionally strong, which is due to the scarcity of goods. As a result, the selling price has been increasing daily. North Road Taicang cotton has reached 207 yuan, and is still delivered from the warehouse. Tongzhou cotton is even scarcer, and the asking price is very high. There is no supply from northern Jiangsu. The current spot cotton transactions are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton: 209.00 - Fellow Dealer Purchased 100 Bales</p>
<p>Small White Bales: 199.00 - Fellow Dealer Purchased 49 Bales</p>

<p>Sea-Fire Wood Frame: 202.75 - Also 170 Bales</p>
<p>Also: 201.00 - Also 100 Bales</p>
<p>According to other news, the foreign cotton market price, the New York cotton market, was stable this morning. The price strengthened first due to purchases by speculators and then due to purchases by the industry. As a result, the closing price was 4-5 pound sounds higher than the previous day. The Indian price rose by another 2 rupees, and the Egyptian cotton market rose by more than 10 pound sounds.</p>
<p>Shanghai Foreign Cotton Trading</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton trading has been quite active recently, but all trading is between dealers. In recent days, spot goods on the market have been almost completely purchased. As a result, dealers began ordering Indian cotton yesterday, with an estimated transaction volume of about 1,000 bales. The factories have remained quiet. The factory delivery prices, converted at an exchange rate of 6.75 yuan, are listed below:</p>

<h3>Grains: Large Quantities of Foreign Rice Arrived - Rice Hoarders Hard to Hold On</h3>
<p>The rice market, which has been plummeting for days, saw a slight rebound the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the sentiment suddenly changed. Those who were willing to sell and those who were not were each found, and the market prices were inconsistent. At the opening, the original wholesale merchants held their goods and observed the situation, unwilling to let go. For the purchasing side, there were still many inquiries for No. 1 Saigon rice, so the buying situation for No. 1 Saigon rice was stable, and there were no ups and downs until the closing. However, for other goods, such as fire-ground rice and small-ground rice, there was little appetite, and trading was scarce. As a result, floating hoarders' morale was weakened again, and prices fell again. At one point, fire-ground rice was only sold for 43.5 to 43 yuan, small-ground rice was sold for 40 yuan, and inferior quality was sold for only 39 yuan. Inferior quality Tokyo peaked at 39.5 to 39.3 yuan, which was about 0.5 to 1 yuan lower than the previous closing price. After this, the market hovered all the way until the closing, with no changes. As for mixed broken rice and other market goods, in order to meet the needs of stable sales, the amount sold on the market was limited. The shops and retail outlets were welcomed by the general public and needed to meet retail sales, so sales were particularly strong, and yesterday, they were able to stand out with a gain of 0.3 to 0.5 yuan, with prices ranging from 35.5 yuan. Glutinous rice continued to be weak, falling by about 0.5 yuan. There was no news of trading outside the market for thick and thin japonica rice and early and late rice.</p>
<p>Although the foreign rice price from overseas has been reduced, after the Shanghai market's consecutive days of sharp declines, the sentiment is soft. Although the price reduction can be implemented, foreign customers do not dare to continue to order. The batches that were previously ordered are arriving one after another. Yesterday, another ship arrived and was waiting to be unloaded, and one or two more ships will arrive soon. The large quantity and huge amount of silver are enough to shake the stability of the large accounts, and the floating accounts are even more frightened. Yesterday, some customers from the countryside and shops took the opportunity to buy in small quantities, while the back-to-back futures remained difficult to trade. Although the cargo holders tried their best to maintain the prices, the result was that each continued to cut prices by 0.4 to 0.5 or 0.6 to 0.7 yuan. 4,500 bags of foreign rice were offered, but only more than 300 tons of futures were counted. No. 2 Siamese rice was 50 yuan, and No. 2 Saigon rice was 50.08 to 50.05 yuan. Mixed broken rice was 42.25 yuan plus commission. The counter-offer for small-ground rice in the afternoon was 48.5 yuan, which was not agreed upon.</p>
<p>Yesterday, another large batch of foreign rice arrived, managed by Java Company. The Sawah Loento, carried rice from Yangon to Shanghai. Entered port around 8:00 am yesterday. Approximately 4,500 tons were loaded, for a total of 45,000+ sacks and unloaded at the Pudong Blue Funnel wharf. The Ombi lin, also managed by Java Company, is scheduled to arrive from Saigon this afternoon. It is scheduled to dock at the Kung Ho Cheung wharf. The foreign rice loaded on this vessel is of the enormous amount of over 71,000 sacks. It is said that this foreign rice is managed by the Jian Yuan Company.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Step Down</h3>
<p>Flour: The market trended downstream yesterday. During the period of flat selling in the street, demand was of course slightly stronger. Although there were some embellishments from the mainland and rural villages, the number was limited. The main market was depressed due to the export ban. Only the high cost of raw materials and the limited number of back-to-back goods made it difficult to continue falling. There were few transactions yesterday morning. The market only started to open slightly later, and only the old car brand saw trading, with prices easing from 14.35 yuan to 14.3 yuan. There were only sporadic small transactions.</p>
<p>Wheat: The wheat market showed a setback yesterday, because most of the foreign wheat that had been ordered by various factories will arrive in Shanghai this month. Therefore, floating accounts are waiting and watching, and domestic factories' appetite is also stagnant. It is reported that the Nanyang banks and the Japanese factories have slightly purchased some goods. The opening price for Changshu wheat was 23.3 yuan, and the price for Suzhou wheat was 23.8 yuan. 500 bales were traded, which was a few cents lower than the previous price.</p>
<p>Imports: Yesterday, there were 1,600 pieces of raw oil, 100 pieces of soybean oil, and 448 bales of soybeans, all transported from Yantai.</p>
<p>Exports: Today, there are 650 bales of soybeans to be shipped to Xianggang [Hong Kong], and 1,000 bales of rice to be shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Black Watermelon Seeds Gain More Momentum</h3>
<p>Black watermelon seeds have recently been actively purchased by the Nanyang banks, and the supply is scarce. As a result, the price has risen sharply. Jikui has reached 90 yuan, Gaoxukui seeds are also close to 80 yuan, and Dalian seeds are 60 yuan. Those who have inventory are unwilling to sell immediately, which is a rare new high price in recent years.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Xinghua Green Slabs Rise by Two Yuan</h3>
<p>According to Dutch telegrams, the sugar market C.I.F. K.G. rate is 9.55 Dutch Guilders which is one tenth of a Guilder less than before. The trend of the exchange rate is flat. The spot price of 24 crude white is unchanged. The wooden stack is 62.5 yuan. Newly arrived shipments in outside warehouses are 62.3 to 62.2 yuan, old shipments are 62 to 61.9 yuan. Transshipments are 49 yuan. Taigu's Car White is slightly tight, rising by 0.2-0.3 yuan. Western stack B Mark is 67 yuan, CW Mark is 66.5 yuan, CX Mark is 65 yuan, DY Mark is 64.2 yuan, and HX Mark is 63.7 yuan. Eastern stack goods are sold at discounted prices, and all other items are generally unremarkable. Chinese businesses and Hua banks opened 200 pieces of green slabs at 42.2 yuan (cash), which is nearly 2 yuan higher than before.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Sales of Indian and Philippine Silk Still Difficult to Develop</h3>
<p>The silk market rebounded in both the United States and Japan yesterday. New York prices rose by 0.125 for March and 0.095 for forward contracts. Yokohama spot prices rose by 40 yuan, and forward prices rose by 27 yuan. The local silk market, in light of the fatigue of previous silk prices, returned to Suzhou yesterday, and external sales intentions became strong. As a result, Dachang, Renji, and Lianna all had transactions. 75% of white factory sales were open for 60 tan at 5,050 yuan. 83% of electricity transactions previously made on the previous day were open for 10 tan at 5,100 yuan. Due to the long-silent silk market, it was quite lively. Sales of Indian and Philippine silk are still difficult to develop. The trend of the entire silk market is still unable to turn upwards. Four thousand pieces of tea will be transported to Tianjin on the 9th.</p>
<h3>Coal: Haifeng Coal is Firm, Exceeding Fireplace White Coal</h3>
<p>Haifeng White Coal trading has not been lonely recently, due to limited old inventory and no new arrivals. At this time between the old and the new, sellers' intentions are quite firm and unwilling to devalue, so the market is firm, exceeding Fireplace White Coal. The opening price for Haifeng large lumps is 180 yuan per ton, screened lumps are 170 yuan, and general coal is 160 yuan per ton. Customers are charged extra for delivery.</p>
<h3>Wool Single-Faced Broadcloth: Still Extremely Popular</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Friday, the woolen goods broadcloth market remained brisk and rising, with all goods generally in short supply. Single-faced broadcloth remains extremely popular, widely chosen for both Chinese and Western clothing, due to its sturdy, durable, and long-lasting qualities, resulting in strong sales. Unfortunately, British products are scarce and expensive. Manufacturers in Shanghai, due to high raw material costs, have mostly ceased production long ago. This has led to a significant shortage of goods in the market. The standard market price yesterday for British-made Grade A single-faced broadcloth was 33 yuan per yard wholesale, Grade B was 28 yuan, and Shanghai-made broadcloth typically sold for 15 or 16 yuan. Grade A Eastern goods sold for 19 yuan.</p>

<p>Old News Re-copied - Sixty-Seven Years Ago (218) (From our newspaper during the Tongzhi 12th year of the Qing Dynasty)</p>
<h3>Biography of Cui'e</h3>
<p>Ji Sheng, named Ru Yu, was a native of Shanxi province, and a descendant of a prominent family. From a young age, he studied the classics and histories and had a free-spirited nature. Duke Donghai was the magistrate of Jingjiang and hired him. To the east of the town was Chong Sheng Temple, where incense was burned in great abundance. Distinguished women would come to worship like clouds. Ji Sheng, taking advantage of his leisure during a spring outing, strolled to observe. There was a young maiden with her hair in a bun, whose beauty was unsurpassed, graceful like a fairy. Sheng was so entranced and infatuated that he almost forgot to return. It happened that Sheng had a friend, Mr. Zhou, who lived near the maiden. Sheng then frequently visited him, intending to gain access to the girl. Zhou knew his hidden intention and jokingly said, "The red wall is so close, it makes one eagerly anticipate, but surely there is someone who can help." Sheng, surprised and suspicious, said, "You truly understand me, but without having met her or exchanged a letter, how can it be easy?" Zhou said, "The maiden's family has been engaged in needlework for a long time, and many come to buy, implying a search for a worthy man. I know this well. If I accompany you, we can pretend to buy her needlework." Sheng agreed. The next day, they went together and met an old woman with white hair, who was the maiden's mother. The maiden's name was Cui'e, she was eighteen years old, understood poetry, and had a firm and lofty ambition, unwilling to marry anyone but a man like Liang Hong. Sheng took the opportunity to flirt with her, and both the old woman and the maiden were agreeable. However, Sheng's father was strict and the family's status high, making it difficult to allow a match with the maiden's family. Nevertheless, Sheng was secretly pleased that there was a way, and gradually increased his visits. One day, the old woman and her relatives went to the countryside to celebrate a birthday. Sheng secretly and confidently went to Cui'e's residence. At that time, Cui'e was tired from embroidery and pacing under the flowers. Raising her eyes and seeing Sheng, she was surprised by his sudden arrival. Sheng stepped forward, bowed, and said, "I am deeply grateful for your previous letter, which intensifies my longing. If my humble sincerity could be a servant in your chamber, I would die without regret!" Cui'e lowered her head shyly, half-resisting and half-yielding. Before long, Sheng's family moved to Longshan and strongly invited him to visit. Sheng hesitated, unsure of what to do. He consulted Cui'e, who said, "Do not let your private feelings make me bear the burden of guilt." A few days later, Sheng went to the maiden's house again and heard the old woman crying sadly. Entering, he saw that Cui'e had hanged herself.</p>

<h3>The Soviet News Industry</h3>
<p>— Xin Xu</p>
<p>"News is not only a collective propagandist and agitator but also a collective organizer." This is the characteristic of Soviet news. All news nationwide is managed under the supervision of party and government organs and trade unions. There is no private media outlet. This is completely different from the news industry in other countries. In the Soviet Union, there is also an "Industrial Correspondence Agency," which is directly linked to various news outlets. In addition to greatly helping the cause of national construction, it also has profound significance in understanding the real life of the people throughout the country. Therefore, the Soviet Union considers the news industry to be an important national institution.</p>
<p>In terms of the geographical distribution of news publications, there are four types: All-Union news, Republic news, provincial and local news, and administrative district news. In terms of the nature of society, there are general political news, industrial news, agricultural news, trade union news, Communist Party news, Young Communist League news, Young Pioneer news, women's news, and factory news, etc.</p>
<p>In terms of form, there are daily, bi-monthly, semi-weekly, weekly, ten-day, semi-monthly, monthly, quarterly, and annual publications, etc. The number of pages is generally four pages. The major Soviet news publications are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Pravda (Truth), the news of the Soviet Union, is published daily with a circulation of over four million copies. It is the organ of the Federal Communist Party, founded on May 5, 1912, and is the oldest and only newspaper in the Soviet Union. Its chief editor is Molotov. The founding date of Pravda has now been designated as "Publication Day" in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>(2) Izvestia (News), the organ of the Soviet government, is published daily with a circulation of 2.5 million copies. It was founded on February 18, 1917. Its chief editor is Bukharin, an authority in the news industry.</p>
<p>(3) Industrialization, with a total circulation of 800,000 copies daily, is the guiding news for the industrialization movement aimed at the Five-Year Plan and is the organ of the People's Committee for Heavy Industry.</p>
<p>(4) Economic Life, the joint organ of the Gosplan, the headquarters of planned economy, and the People's Committee of Finance, is published daily with a circulation of 200,000 copies.</p>
<p>(5) Peasant News, news for guiding the development of agricultural economy and collective farms, is directly under the Central Committee of the Party and is published every three days with a circulation of over three million copies.</p>
<p>(6) Red Star, the organ of the Revolutionary Military Committee, is published daily with a circulation of over 400,000 copies and is the publication of the highest national defense organ of the Federation.</p>
<p>(7) Komsomolskaya Pravda (Young Communist League Truth), the organ of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, has a total daily circulation of over one million copies. However, the size of any news in Soviet Russia is very small. For example, Pravda, which has a daily circulation of four million copies, is only about the size of an ordinary newspaper. The reason is that there is no commercial competition in the Soviet Union, and commercial advertising is unnecessary. The space of a newspaper is enough to publish various important domestic and foreign news.</p>

<h3>Children's Cries</h3>
<p>— Jin Fan</p>
<p>We cannot deny that "a child's cry is an expression of unhappiness, lack of joy, and discomfort; it is the opposite of laughter." However, this is too narrow a definition. Humans are the most intelligent of all beings, so they have more planning and pretense than other animals. Children, due to hereditary factors from their parents, understand pretense, hypocrisy, and even deception and coercion from a very young age. Although they do not know these terms, they are indeed very good at using these skills. Their only means is "crying."</p>
<p>Crying does indeed make many parents feel overwhelmed. Watching their beloved child shed tears and cry incessantly troubles them, with pity and anger intermingling in their hearts. Thus, patient parents will comply with their children in every way, while impatient parents will hit their children. However, neither of these is a good way to deal with a child's crying.</p>
<p>Let's first talk about the disadvantages of "compliance"! For example, if your child wants candy and you don't agree, he cries loudly and continuously. At this time, you are annoyed by his crying and, on the other hand, pity him and comply with him. Then your child achieves victory and understands that this victory comes from "crying." He gets a revelation that crying will make everything come true, and he will often use crying to coerce you in the future.</p>
<p>As for "hitting," we have long recognized in education that "corporal punishment" is not a good way to educate children. It often makes children ignore the reason for the corporal punishment and instead fosters a distorted hatred in their hearts. Over time, this hatred takes root in his heart. We often see a child hating his father for this reason. Ordinary men are generally less gentle and considerate towards children than women. If "hitting" is used to cure a child's crying, it may have some effect, but it is not a real effect. It makes your child leave you, it makes your child fear you, so that there is an invisible wall between parents and children. We say that children are happy angels in the family and comforters of parents. When children lose their lively and innocent demeanor, what fun is there to talk about in this family?</p>
<p>So, how should we deal with children's crying? Mr. Chen Qin said, "Have sympathy for children" and "Be a companion to children." These two principles of child education, derived from experience, are the only way to deal with children's crying. As parents, do not simply "command" children according to your own wishes, because "children are not small-scale adults." Their psychology and physiology are completely different from adults. Adults should understand this point, observe children from their perspective, seek the reason for their crying each time, understand their desires and needs, and sympathize with them. Sympathy will make children trust you and be close to you. In this way, you can use the position of a companion to persuade and guide them according to their age and level. Use more metaphors, and children like to imitate. You can set a good example. This is the only rational way to deal with children's crying and can achieve very good results.</p>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>The Place Where Blood Flowed</h3>
<p>— Ma Zhujun</p>
<p>One day, I was waiting for the tram on Avenue Joffre.</p>
<p>I was surrounded by the sounds of people, cars, tram bells, and hawkers shouting, all the sounds of the city.</p>
<p>I saw countless crowds, like a long sea of people. Women wore beautiful fur coats, and men combed their hair neatly. I also saw many pot-bellied merchants and wealthy gentlemen, with cigars in their mouths, the neon lights shining on their bald heads, on the women in their arms, and on their triumphant smiling faces. I also saw those many vendors, carrying the burdens of life, looking at passers-by with pleading eyes, and uttering their tragic cries.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a cry of anguish caught my attention. In front of the tavern door, a young man in a suit was forcefully knocking down a rickshaw puller. I knew that the cry came from the person lying on the ground. He cried, got up from the ground, and tried to grab the young man's coat, but a powerful fist landed on his nose in quick succession. Blood spurted from the man's nose, staining his hand and coloring his collar red. He cried and screamed in fear, trying to hold the young man. But it was no use. The young man hit his head hard while using his hand to push open the glass doors and windows of the tavern.</p>
<p>The rickshaw puller was kicked by the beautiful leather shoes and knocked down again. The young man walked into the tavern proudly. The rickshaw puller followed, wanting to go in, but the servants inside blocked the door, giving him terrible looks. The rickshaw puller cried and shouted outside. Many people stood around. People told him to report it to the police. He wiped his swollen nose, wiped away the continuous stream of red blood, and staggered along the way. The police came, and many people breathed a sigh of relief. The police went into the tavern. The rickshaw puller helplessly wiped the blood outside. People told him to look up so the bleeding would stop. The police came out and looked helplessly at the rickshaw puller. Some unfair words rang out in the crowd. The police went back inside. People began to become dissatisfied. The glass doors and windows opened again. A fat servant showed a round face, covered with a false smile. His hand was holding a one-dollar new bill in front of the rickshaw puller, but many dissatisfied voices drove the round face back inside.</p>
<p>The police came out, still alone, said a few words to the rickshaw puller, and walked away alone. People started to discuss, some shouting injustice, some spitting harshly, some blushing, but some people moved their feet and walked away. The thin rickshaw puller leaned against the tree trunk, making slight moans, using his hand to adjust his swollen nose, using his hand to caress the wounds on his body, and using his sleeves to wipe away the continuous stream of red blood.</p>
<p>I forgot about the trams passing by one after another. I listened to the groans of life's struggles. My tears welled up in my eyes. Another rickshaw puller glanced at me and asked if I needed a ride. I trembled in terror and looked at him blankly before leaving the place where the neon lights shone on a place where blood had flowed.</p>
<p>A groan under the high pressure of life echoed in my ears. I saw countless unfortunate people before my eyes. In order to make life a little better, they would be beaten, kicked, and even bleed. Many rickshaw pullers offered me business along the way. I shook my head. I was not one of those proud young men. In order to make my own life better, could I also beat others, even to the point of causing them to bleed?</p>
<p>The sounds of the city, I could no longer listen to these struggling groans. (With a reward)</p>

<h3>No Spring</h3>
<p>— Wang Tao</p>
<p>The calendar tells me it is already spring. But I haven't heard any news of spring at all, nor have I felt the warmth of spring. I still feel like I live in the cold ice cellar of severe winter...</p>
<p>Gusts of cold wind blow into the small room, and outside the window flutters a misty spring snow. A cool emotion presses tightly on my heart, and I gradually feel suffocated by life.</p>
<p>I begin to immerse myself in painful thoughts. Then I remember a story, a story about a giant.</p>
<p>...Because the giant was selfish, he did not allow any children to play in his garden, so his garden was always occupied by severe winter. Although several seasons have changed outside, his garden is still filled with flying snowflakes, howling north winds, and bare tree branches... Here, there is only severe winter, no spring.</p>
<p>I also thought of this "island" where we now live...</p>
<p>The cost of living climbs endlessly, and hoarding and manipulation have become a temporary trend. Starving corpses of thousands of people on the brink of death lie at the doors of rice shops, even though the doors are piled high with the rice they seek day and night but cannot obtain!</p>
<p>Is there any spring on this "island"? Let thousands of people on the verge of death warm their cold hearts, let thousands of people on the verge of suffocation breathe some fresh air.</p>
<p>However, there is no spring on the "island". This is a frozen wasteland, a terrible wasteland.</p>
<p>But we eagerly look forward to news of spring! However, there is no spring on the "island"...</p>
<h3>Talking Points</h3>
<p>— Jin Ni</p>
<p>In the Gigo Forest in the Antibe region on the northern shore of Lake Victoria in central Africa, the breasts of men are generally more developed than those of women.</p>
<p>The plants growing on the Lugegera Volcano in Albert National Park in the Belgian Congo are too numerous to count, including plant species from the hot, temperate, and cold zones. It can be called the world's most complete botanical garden.</p>
<p>The place with the most bridges in the world is Venice, Italy, with more than four hundred bridges in the entire area.</p>
<p>According to the recent research results of the great American astronomer Professor Clark, there are two ways the Earth will be destroyed: one is that it will be scorched and melted by the sun's light and heat; the other is that the Earth will be impacted and shattered by a group of mysterious comets in space. However, this event is likely to occur millions of years later.</p>
<h3>The Art of Listening (1)</h3>
<p>At railway crossings, there is always a sign that says, "Stop, look carefully, listen attentively." These few words, though brief, are very important because they can prevent accidents and save lives, preventing people from suffering unwarranted disasters. From this, we can think about how important these two human instincts - seeing and hearing - are to the individual. If used properly, they can make their lives excellent and upward; if used improperly, they can lead to many disasters, even death. A few weeks ago, we talked about how people should "see." Today, we will discuss the instinct of "hearing." Please pay attention. One day, some people brought a deaf and mute person to see Jesus. They knew that Jesus was a famous doctor, so they came specifically to ask Jesus to heal the person. Jesus called the person away from the crowd, put his fingers in his ears, spit on his tongue, sighed deeply to heaven, and then said, "Open." Sure enough, the person's ears were opened, and his tongue was able to speak freely. But the person has taken on a major responsibility ever since! Jesus understands this, so he sighs deeply to heaven before healing his illness. We ordinary people are the same. We enable people to speak and hear, and at the same time, we give him two major responsibilities. His future is dark or bright, depending on whether he knows how to use these two instincts, "hearing" and "seeing." Originally, "hearing" is an art, and everyone should cultivate it carefully. We have a pair of ears, and everyone except deaf people can hear things. This is instinctive hearing. Jesus meant that it is not enough for people to just be able to hear. They have to know how to "hear." He said, "Whoever has ears, let him hear." He meant to teach people to listen to things in the way of Christ. Normally, all kinds of sounds, such as crying, shouting, noise, talking, music, etc., can be heard clearly by everyone without effort. Even the doctrines preached today, you can all hear them, but this topic is derived from the words of Jesus. What did Jesus mean when he said this? Maybe you haven't heard it. When we listen, we don't listen to the superficial sounds. We must be able to understand the unspoken meaning. This is the most important thing.

<h3>Li Chunlai and Chun Gui Yuan</h3>
<p>— Xi Sen</p>
<p>Previously, Mr. Xu Muyun's Records of Pear Garden Anecdotes described Yang Xiaolou's admiration for Li Chunlai, which shows that Chunlai can be regarded as the chief among martial actors in the South without shame. But there is one more thing about Chunlai that is worth mentioning, that is, at that time, he and the Shanghai courtesan Zhu Guizhen founded Chun Gui Yuan, which was magnificent. Few people know that it was the first to establish the grand architectural style of later theaters. Now, I will describe it:</p>
<p>First, there was Zhu Guizhen, a proofreader from Wumen, who ran an incense nest in Gongyang Lane on Sanma Road. She was wild and arrogant and did not get along well with her guests. One day, she wore a Western-style suit and toured Zhang's Wei Chun Garden. Her waist was so slender, she was graceful like a willow in the wind. A Jing Official, Huang, saw her and was infatuated with her. That night, he summoned her to serve wine, and a romantic relationship was established. In less than a month, he ordered her mother to bring her home with ten dou of bright pearls and one hundred taels of silver and placed her in the ranks of golden hairpins. Zhu was intelligent and had a rough understanding of literature since childhood. She often envied young and handsome men like Huang Da Ba when she read novels. She felt that Jing Official Huang was too weak and self-pitying that he was not her mate. So, she used the Pear Garden singing halls as a place to relieve her boredom. At that time, Li Chunlai was performing in a garden, known for his martial arts plays. Guizhen went there every day and lingered there. After a long time, they became close and openly acted like a couple. Although people gossiped about the shame of adultery, some critics even used Jing Official as a warning. However, Chunlai knew that Guizhen had accumulated a lot of wealth, so he had no scruples. One day, Chunlai was on stage, Guizhen arrived late and could not get a seat with the audience. She returned home in great anger and discussed with Chunlai to open a garden alone. Li had long harbored this idea, so he stopped performing at a garden and rented a new site, facing the garden across the street. The architecture and decoration were extremely luxurious, and the decorations were beautiful and unique, the best of all theaters at the time. It was named Chun Gui, after the names of the two. Since then, they went back and forth together, like a couple. Soon, Chunlai was arrested for something, Guizhen used money to bribe officials everywhere, and she did not change her attitude because Chunlai was arrested. Some say that Chunlai's fame was largely due to Guizhen's efforts, and the establishment of Chun Gui Yuan was just the rest of it. I don't know if that's true?</p>
<h3>From Xishan to Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Traveling Reporter</p>
<p>In the Chinese film industry of 1940, a brilliant newcomer was discovered. She is Ziwei, who went from Xishan to Shanghai. Eighteen years ago, Ningbo's "Xishan" Village left a new sprout in the old and beautiful wilderness. Ziwei has a miracle, a black mole about the size of a small dove egg on her left arm.</p>
<p>Her past, a long string of life fragments created by naughty and active blood and tears, has dominated school life, family life, and sports, dancing, and now theatrical life.</p>
<p>Three months ago, she was hired as a basic actor under the efforts of Yihua's recruitment and discovery of new talents. On the day she signed the contract, she completed her screen debut in the blockbuster "The Assassination of the King of Qin" overnight.</p>
<p>Her original name was Wang Lizhen. She used to study at a church girls' school, but she also jumped onto Huoshan and Datong, where she spent ten months as a dancer. However, she was too tired of that life without seeing the sun.</p>
<p>Ziwei is five feet two inches tall and weighs 105 pounds, which is the standard condition for Hollywood stars. Her physique and appearance are also healthy and beautiful. After "The Assassination of the King of Qin," Yihua assigned her the more arduous role of the eldest princess in "Guanyin," which shows how much they valued her is an iron fact.</p>
<p>She, Ziwei, "Now I just want to be quiet for a while and use my limited life to cultivate endless life." She told reporters that she would change and make her character and will serious.</p>
<p>From Xishan to Shanghai, in a chance encounter, Ziwei told herself a long string of light and beautiful stories like wisps of smoke, her smile like spring in March, and her soft and harmonious tune like the south wind made people aspire to her bright future like strong black coffee.</p>
<h3>The Film Star's Health and Beauty in Taylor Holmes's Mouth</h3>
<p>— Yeshuo</p>
<p>John Weissmuller is an athlete who is six feet four inches tall and weighs 190 pounds. He is best at swimming and has won the world swimming championship.</p>
<p>He once said to people, "Hollywood female stars are getting healthier and more beautiful every day. The main reason is exercise. After practicing for a long time, their complexion becomes better, their eyes are bright, and their bodies become healthier and more beautiful."</p>
<p>He also gave many examples, saying, "Joan Crawford is diligent in exercise and has great perseverance. She has a good understanding of dancing and swimming. Jeannette MacDonald is good at tennis and badminton. Myrna Loy is not only a swimmer but also plays badminton well. Loretta Young and Bette Davis are equestrian experts..."</p>
<p>Finally, Weissmuller said, "I am not a beauty doctor, but I know the value of exercise. It can make Hollywood female stars healthier and more beautiful."</p>

<h3>The Purpose of Watching Movies</h3>
<p>— Yuan Shan</p>
<p>In a previous issue, Mr. Xinliang's article "The Purpose of Watching Movies" described the reasons many people watch movies. Now, I, the author, will write about another purpose below.</p>
<p>Probably the majority of moviegoers are children aged eight to sixteen. They love martial arts movies. Their purpose is to watch the flying over roofs and walls, riding the clouds and mist, and the dancing with swords and spears, and other martial arts skills depicted in the films.</p>
<p>Speaking of the purpose of watching movies, in addition to what Xinliang said, "Watching movies should not only be for leisure, entertainment; we should absorb various new learning and new knowledge from those good movie scripts," we should also cultivate our morality and personality, and improve our lives and habits. Now, I will briefly write about one or two examples of past domestic films that meet the above points:</p>
<p>The film "The Gate of Flesh and Spirit" by the former Minxin Film Company can indeed move many people. Its gist is about a family of four—a loving mother, a clever older brother, an innocent younger brother, and a father who is addicted to alcohol and gambling. The whole family is in an extremely miserable state because of a father who does not know how to improve himself. Later, after the older brother's long-term patience, gentle and touching behavior, and earnest persuasion, he awakened a father without a soul, who abandoned evil and returned to righteousness, repented and started anew, thus gaining his new life, and thereafter lived a harmonious and happy new life.</p>
<p>Lianhua's "Tian Lun" (Filial Piety) serves the people with the spirit of "Respect the elderly as you would your own, and cherish the young as you would your own," with the aim of achieving spiritual happiness as the main theme.</p>
<p>The recently released first installment of "Wen Su Chen" by Hezong depicts two women who were devoted to serving Wen Su Chen, but while they were interested, he remained indifferent. Wen Su Chen steadfastly refused them because he already had a wife. Our country has always emphasized the chastity of women, and I say, why shouldn't men also be able to obtain peace of mind and body?</p>
<p>I believe that the importance of spiritual nourishment far outweighs that of physical nourishment. I wonder if you all agree?</p>
<h3>Chess Garden</h3>
<p>— Compiled by Lian Xuezheng, Edited by Lu Chengzhun</p>
<p>Opening Game Method, Game Sixty-one</p>
<p>Black Moves First</p>
<p>Moves will be revealed in the next issue.</p>
<p>Moves:</p>
<p>Cannon 2 to 5, Cannon 8 to 5, Horse 2 advances to 3, Horse 8 advances to 7, Chariot 1 advances 1,</p>
<p>Chariot 9 to 8, Chariot 1 to 6, Horse 1 advances 1, Pawn 9 advances 1, Chariot 8 advances 4,</p>
<p>Horse 8 advances 9, Pawn 1 advances 1, Pawn 9 advances 1, Chariot 8 to 1, Chariot 6 advances 6,</p>
<p>Cannon 2 advances 4, Advisor 4 advances 5 changes to Cannon 2 to 1, Chariot 9 to 8, Chariot 1 to 2,</p>
<p>Cannon 8 advances 2, Pawn 7 advances 1, Cannon 8 to 7, Chariot 1 to 1, Chariot 8 advances 5,</p>
<p>Horse 1 advances 1</p>
<p>According to this game, both sides' responses are extremely stable and flawless. However, Black's seventeenth move, Advisor 4 advances 5, is the key move. If the left advisor responds, it will definitely lose the initiative. See the next issue for the variations.</p>
<h3>Jin Suqin Stars in "Wenji Returns to Han," Overseas Chinese Prepare to Open New Company in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Haixing</p>
<p>Recently, several overseas Chinese who operate film businesses in the Philippines plan to open a film production company in Shanghai. They have been actively preparing for three or four months. The person in charge is a certain Mr., a film industry giant who has been retired since the war.</p>
<p>The company's plan is quite ambitious, but the person in charge claims that it is not yet time to announce it, so we can only reveal this much information for now. It is heard that the company's first film is tentatively set as "Wenji Returns to Han," and Jin Suqin has been invited to play the role of Wenji. The company is scheduled to be established in late April, so it does not conflict with Jin Suqin's trip to Hong Kong for performances.</p>
<p>Most of the personnel of this new company, such as directors, actors, and other technical personnel, are invited back from the rear (wartime locations). Therefore, once this company is established, it will surely refresh our senses.</p>
