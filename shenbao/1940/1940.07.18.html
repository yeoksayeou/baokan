<p>華盛頓　美國國務卿赫爾昨日在情報會議中、公開表示美國反對英國對日諒解之政策、申稱美國不同意英國封鎖緬甸通路之決定、因美國在全世界主張自由貿易之原則、故不同意滇緬之封鎖、認爲英國此種對日讓步、不但危害美國商務、同時有碍整個世界貿易、美國政府已將此種立塲、通知倫敦矣、（十七日海通社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　美國國務卿赫爾、昨日設法加强英國抵抗日本向英提出封鎖滇緬公路之要求、謂美國反對任何「難以保證」之英日協定、赫爾立塲在答覆新聞記者詢問英日談判之正式文吿中撮述之、赫雨表示英國尙未作最後決定、渠望阻止英國勉從日方之要求、美國政府反對封鎖國際通商常經之任何公路、由日本政府授意而封鎖緬甸公路、係無理由干涉國際商務、頃間華盛頓日報著評述英國對於緬甸公路之舉動、謂英國之舉動、乃對日本壓力、毫不掩飾之屈服、緣英國封鎖緬甸公路將削弱中國地位、並將使中國向日本屈服、此舉將使在遠東擁有利益之各國均受打擊、（十七日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　國務院昨宣布反對世界貿易途徑如緬甸路與越南鐵路等之封鎖、國務卿赫爾發表文吿如下、國務卿於新聞記者詢以對於英政有因日方請求、將暫禁某種貨物由緬甸路運入中國事之意見時聲稱、美政府對於世界各處通商要道之開放有合法利益、故認緬甸路如果採行之禁運、及越南鐵路近已採行之禁運、將成立阻碍世界貿易之不正當地位、（十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　國務卿赫爾昨日稱、美國反對英國所提結束中日戰事之方法、赫爾曾吿新聞界、英國之封閉滇緬路、美將認之爲世界商業途徑上不當有之陣碍、而最近滇越路之封閉、亦爲美國所反對、蓋美國有合法之權利、保持各處通商路綫之開放也、彼又作警句曰、吾人勿忘英國之禁止軍火山緬運華、乃因日本要求之故、此語殊有意味、溯自中日開戰以來、英美對於亞洲問題之政策、始終並行不悖、今觀赫爾之言論、彼此已開始分道揚鑣矣、美國之態度、英政府諒必知之、但外交界以爲表面上雖星裂痕、或尙不至於到逹嚴重之地步、（十七日國際社電）</p>
<p>支加哥　此間官方頃信、國務卿赫爾昨日所爲美國反對封鎖滇緬公路之聲明、已爲美國遠東政策進入積極之現象、羅斯福總統昨日於與報界談話時、對赫爾之聲明、未予評論、赫爾之聲明是否係與英國之政策衝突、羅總統拒絕發言、然消息靈通之政界及官方人士稱、羅總統自必具有一種允許赫爾爲美國遠東外交領導之意思、若輩並稱羅總統之拒絕評論赫爾聲明、並足表示美政府之意見、係認緬甸公路事件完全爲外交問題、尙未致若歐洲情勢之成爲一廣大之國策問題、而必須總統重申其意旨者、政府官吏並指陳、美國艦隊縱令若干人士主張調赴大西洋、但於太平洋實有重大之意義、政府官吏並力言、美國顯已決意對遠東局勢之發展、採取積極之立塲、而對於日本內閣之變史允爲注意、國務卿赫爾顯然相信美國對於遠東仍將保持其有力之立塲、而於任何日本迫令英國採取妨碍世界貿易之行動、自須予以考慮、（十七日合衆電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　觀於赫爾之言論、美國對於封閉緬甸公路事之多大關切、顯然可見、惟若謂美國現願有所舉動、以制止日本强迫英國參加封鎖中國之野心、則美國尙無此表示、美艦隊固留駐於夏威夷、惟政治觀察家以爲美國籍國防計畫名義、禁止廢鐵或煤油輸日等行動之可能、今尙遙遙無期、一般人現皆注視時局、旣感興趣、且抱憂慮、華盛頓郵報表示此間人士對於緬甸路事之意見、謂無論環境如何、英國所宣布封閉此路之準備、實爲變相的對日投降、今英國旣已示弱、日本將亟以小小讓步之零星收獲爲滿足乎、殊可疑也、英國企圖稍保全其遠東利益、結果通開放完全消威其利益之門戶耳、日本口頭允於今後三個月內設法結束戰事、此事並未引起此間樂觀、因衆覺英國旣自退却、而美國復不亟於有所行動、日本於此、其議和條件將較以前所暗示者更爲嚴酷也、（十七日合衆電）</p>
<p>東京　日外務省發言人須磨彌吉郞、頃於評論美國務卿赫爾反對英日封鎖緬甸公路協定之聲明、力言緬甸路問題、與美國無涉、須磨云、「此乃英日兩國之事、刻正在談判中、與美國毫無關係、」（十七日合衆社電）</p>
<p>英下院議長干涉議院提問話</p>
<p>倫敦　今日下院開會時、有人對英日關於緬甸公路地位之妥治事、提出問話、外次白特勒答稱、英政府最近曾接日本政府對於供給品經過運華事、所提出之若干要求、英政府對此項要求曾加考慮、並對於與日政府商妥一種指定時期事、巳獲實際上之進步、締結協定之消息、大的隨時可以發表云、白氏又表示詳盡之陳述、將於以後發表、渠希望各議員勿迫其對於所提出之特殊各點作答、自由黨議員羅白資繼起問話、謂鑒於昨日美國務卿赫爾所發之公開宣首、是否美政府對於所商妥之辦法、已表示贊成或反對、白氏答稱、渠意美國之宣言應留待美人加以解釋、自由黨議員曼德亦起立向白氏發問曰、彼其認此種行爲係對侵略者妥協乎、（衆呼「可恥」）、此實屬可恥、彼以爲此事較在慕尼黑及其他地方所爲者更爲成功乎、至此議長出而干預、請曼德氏勿忘外次白特勒早已表示、各議員勿再提出問話、曼氏不聽、仍繼續發言、但白氏置諸不答、（十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　今日英下院於外次白特勒報吿英日緬甸公路協定卽將簽訂後、全院大譁、勞工黨議院孟特爾、於外次發言後、卽在呼此項協定、大爲可恥、孟氏要解釋此項協定是否比較以英國綏靖政策下之慕尼黑會議爲優、雖議長宣稱、孟氏此項質問越出題外、但孟氏不顧議長在呼「秩序」、繼續質問、謂美國務鄕赫爾已發表聲明此項聲明、顯爲抗議性質、英國政府、是否竟拒絕美國貨品經由緬甸公路運入中國乎、外次答稱、渠認此項聲明、實爲不負責任之舉、工黨議員羅勃脫當卽認外次之答覆爲不滿意、並稱休息之際仍將討論此一問題、外次謂英國業已接受日本之要求、（十七日合衆社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　今日上院開會時、薜西爾勳爵曾提出問話、謂政府對於英日之談判可吾發表言論、外相哈立法克斯勳爵於答覆之時、曾作簡短之陳述、措辭與外次白特勒在下院發表者相同、並謂現因日政府辭職之原因、渠對於一種協定之締結、朱續接官方情報、故目前不能作詳盡之陳述、渠希望能於明日爲之云、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　中國大使郭泰祺今日吿路透訪員、華人皆知日本刻在華深陷泥淖中、不能自拔、徒事恫嚇、乃英國竟擬調解中日戰爭、殊難索解、此舉影響、徒銷除日本最大障礙而使日本更增其對於遠東英人利益之侵略而已、中國無論如何、不改變其地位、非俟日軍全數退出中國後、決不與之媾和、（十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　昨夜路透外交訪員探悉、中國大使郭泰祺兩日前至外部交涉緬旬路暫停某種貨物運輸事、聞郭大使陳述中政府對於此時謀開始一般和平談判、所可有的後果之煩慮、並說明中政府認重要物品通過此路之限制、仍與英國為國聯會員國之擔任相抵觸、中政府固知英國此時所遇之困難、然希望英國明白表示此種限制貨運之決定、並不擬妨礙英國對華之將來政策、據倫敦人士意見、英政府所期望之任何總解決、僅以在中國可視爲公允平等的和平爲標準、（十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　路透外交訪員從負資方面探悉、英政府將滇緬路問題之發展隨時通知駐蘇大使克利沛、並準備答復蘇聯所可提出之問話、同時英政府亦將英日談判情形通知駐英中國大使郭泰祺、英政府尙未接到中政府抗議、但此抗議文或已送交重慶英大使館而在轉達中、（十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>渝報繼續抨擊英國遠東政策</p>
<p>重慶　中國報紙今日繼續攻擊英國之「軟弱」遠東政策、並斥責「可惡的英國政治家、」企圖以遠東之慕尼黑會議、犧牲中國以自保其遠東之屬地、大公報稱、英國允許日人之要求而封鎖緬甸公路、並不能變更日人攻擊亞洲英國屬地之決心、現英國犧牲中國以保持其遠東權益之企圖、已因日本米內內閣之辭職、而趨於粉碎、日本參加歐戰攻擊英國之舉、卽將實現、狡滑之英國所種之惡因、亦將自食其果、中央日報稱、不論英國所主張之封鎖緬甸公路期限爲三月或三日、英國一旦向日本投降、卽喪失其全部之聲威、大英帝國應知目前已面臨一卽將發現之整個的打擊矣、共產黨機關報新華日報宣稱、英國今日種植惡凶、明日便將自食惡果、日本現已着手南進、而以香港·緬甸·印度及新加坡爲初步之目標、英國已往之行動、恐將追悔莫及、新民報更大聲疾呼云、「鼓勵日本南進者英國而已、」（十七日合衆社電）</p>
<p>重慶　此間華方人士仍集中注意於英日之談判、今晨各報均以顯著地位刋登蔣委員長及外部之宜言、但對於倫敦新加坡及東京所傳此事之消息則未見登載、（十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>重慶　北加羅抄那都克大學政治學助敎、前中國政府某顧問之子林巴基爾博士、頃對緬甸路之封鎖、深爲扼腕、謂此項封鎖、已將碩果僅存之美貨運華通路阻塞矣、（十七日合衆社電）</p>
<p>日方宣稱封鎖將自今日開始</p>
<p>東京　日外務省發言人頃宣佈緬甸公路協定之締結云、談判之結果、英政府將自七月十八日起、以三個月爲限、禁止軍火彈藥·汽油·卡車及鐵路材料運經緬甸、（十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>東京　據稱關於緬甸公路之使用問題、已正式臻於妥協、今日傍晚英大使克萊琪曾與有田外相晤談、歷一小時之久、妥協條件立時尙不可知、（十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>東京　官方頃宣佈英大使克萊琪與日外相有田所談判之封鎖緬甸公路問題、頃已達到最後解決、惟協定之詳細內容、今晚外　尙未　備、（十七日合衆社電）</p>
<p>路　社向外務省發言人須磨探悉、關於緬甸公路之談判、實際業已完成、日政府唯待倫對方面對於英大使克萊琪細微詳則之覆文、發言人請渠希望談判在現內閣之下結束、現內閣仍留職以待新閣之就職、其期大的爲星期四日、如屆日談判不能完成、則此事勢將中懸矣、（十七日踷透社電）</p>
<p>東京　外務省發言人今日招待新聞記者時、有詢以日本對馬來代理總督瓊斯之演說有何反響者、發言人答稱、就吾人所知、今並無此種和平談話、發言人承認第三國連英國在內、抱有中日戰爭儘速終止之希望、惟如馬來總督所表示之調解、則今尙未予以討論、　　者問日內閣之更易、是否將影響英日緬甸公路問題之談判、發言人答曰否、此項談判實際業已完成、英大使克萊琪今唯候倫敦方面關於若干技　點之訓令、渠希望有田外相與克萊琪及時作最後談話、俾由現將下野之內閣與英國解決此事、至於現內閣將於何時出新內閣代之、無人能予逆料、繼乃談及新內閣之政策、發言人謂渠料新內　之外交內國政策、均將依新政治機　之基礎進行之、（十七日路透</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c2">日閣更迭與所謂新政體制 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>日本米內內閣，於本月十六日突以軍部方面發動倒閣而吿傾圯，上距其成立於一月中旬，不過恰滿六個月。中日戰事甫滿三年，日本內閣已更迭到數四，就中近衛內閣生命雖較長，其間却經過兩次以上的局部改組；自平沼內，閣以降各屆，其平均柄政期間並未能超過半載以上。日本正在對華作戰期間，而國內政情動盪不安若此，誠爲在戰時的國家所罕見。</p>
<p>要檢討米內內閣之所以倒坍，請先追溯其組成的經過；當今春阿部內閣崩圯之後，近衛旣拒絕出馬，元老重臣又不願政權落入軍部掌握，一向以持重著稱的米內乃應運出而組成多少帶有保守色彩的前閣；以是其自身實帶有過渡性質，且自始即爲軍部所不喜，雖軍部在內閣中的比重已相對的增加，却始終對之缺乏善意的支援。半載以來，無論軍事外交和內政，米內都不能比阿部時代有更多的成家在歐戰中獲得了初步勝利、遂更引起日本急進分子的絕大衝動、加强軸心聯繫和改變「不介入」立塲一類呼聲都高唱入雲。米內政府雖曾竭力適應此一趨勢、厲行南進、對外採取攻勢，終不能饜足軍部及一般急進者流的願望。而另一方面，日本新黨運動的急轉直下，對於倚重既成政黨的米內內閣又形成嚴重威脅。以是而米內內閣的崩潰乃爲目前無可避免的命運。</p>
<p>但是此屆米內內閣之倒，却不單純是已往閣潮的重演，因爲此度軍部倒閣的理由是現閣對於「新政體制運動」缺乏合作，而繼任閣揆呼聲最高的近衛又正是所謂「新政體制運動」的倡導者。如果已往內閣的更迭都是爲了政策和人事上的理由，則此屆閣潮顯然更有政制問題穿揷其間，這是値得特別注意的一點。所謂「新政體制」問題即是一年半以前近衛因而下台的所謂「國民再編成運動」的變相，這在本質上是一種法西斯運動，而新黨運動則爲其主要具體形態。自近衛辭去樞密院長職務而後，此一運動乃益形膨脹；其中心意義及其內容，據近衛在本月七日對日本記者團的談話，大致可歸納爲下列四項：</p>
<p>一、「新政體制」的目標不僅爲促進「事變」解決及對付國際新形勢，更須放棄速成主義，樹立恒久的政治體制。</p>
<p>二，改革統帥立法行政三者與人民間分離的關係，形成「政治一元化」，而以人民組織之政治力支配內閣及議會，但並不主張變更憲法。</p>
<p>三、避免與政治現局混爲一談，近衛本人亦並不攷慮掌握政權問題，且對視新黨運動爲倒閣運動者表不滿。</p>
<p>四、實現的順序和時機均尙無具體決定。</p>
<p>從這些妥領可以看出近衛個人野心之大；他不只製造了使日本獨覇遠東的「新秩序」理論，更進而日本政制上的根本改革，準備把一向分離着的軍事政治和立法統一起來，放到人民組織的支配之下。但其進行步驟則是溫和的漸進的，並沒有援用强力的準備。這在軍權超過一切，且社會間還存有濃厚封建性的日本，自然是個非常困難的課題。惟其如此，所以近衛並不期以速成，且妥避免與政局現况相混淆。這樣可見此度軍部之突起倒閣於近衛認爲「新政體制」尙未成熟的期間，並力主以近衛膺組閣之任，這無髯謂與近衛本來的意志相違反的。日軍部心目中的「新政治機構」，與近衛抱負中的「新政治體制」其間具何同異，目前固驟難斷定；但有如近衛所標榜的「把軍政人民聯爲一體且以國民組織之政治力爲其心臟及原動力的體制」，必不能盡與日軍部所企望的軍事法西斯盡相符合。是以此際日軍部縱以擁護「新政治體制」爲理由而推翻米內內閣，即使第二次近衛內閣繼而成立，也未必能减消日本統治者層的內部磨擦，形成「政治一元化」。何况目前所謂一黨運動還只得到在沒落中的一些黨派贊助，在擁有議會大多數的民政黨本部，其最近揭布的政綱雖亦强調「完成高度國防」「確立國家總力體制」等原則，對新黨運動則並無積極表示。至於財界產業界以及兩年以前積極支持新黨運動的人物都保持着一貫的冷靜。可見日本政局的客觀形勢，對於近衛所抱負的目標還隔有遙遠的距離。</p>
<p>日本的侵略慾望已因國際間的刺激而劇增，但日本的實力並不能適應着需要而加大，其唯一出路只有極力加緊國內統制以從事於對外的投機與冒險。米內內閣的傾覆已暗示着日本保守陣容的沒落，無論此度內閣繼任者是誰，在此際必無法擺脫軍部的强力控制，其對外政策必將轉趨極端，而日本整個的國運，亦必不免陷於更瘋在的賭注。</p>

<p>目前，臘戌至中國邊境的一百五十英里，日间是禁止載重汽車通行的，私人汽車則全路通行無阻。橫亙湄公江及怒江上的橋樑，而爲銅鐵所造的現代橋樑。實際上交通除開河流間的狭谷以外，並不是限於一條路上。該路的主道是在騰越以南一百英里，但另一條至人莫的路，卻經過騰越城。同樣在緬甸境內，車輛也可由南坎繆司（譯音）及滾弄渡以外鐵路綫上抵達中國邊境。更有一條路經過開通（譯音），較其他路爲長，而在其更北，也有許多車輛，來自密支那的鐵路終點。</p>
<p>中國人不滿意於滇緬公路的運輸，又在開始建造一條鐵路。自昆明至楚雄一段，可望於本年七月造成。據最近消息，蔣委員長已命令自楚雄至緬甸邊境一段在本年內完成。中國工程處估計在中國境內鐵路建造的費用，包括二百個隧道在內，須四百萬鎊。此路如果造成，則每天可載貨三百噸，基數量不下於滇越路的運輸。</p>
<p>在新公路開始建造成後的六個月，英國輪船史坦霍爾號載了六千噸的蘇聯軍火自奧德柴港開往仰光轉中國。一九三八年的十月，軍火由輪船上卸下來運往臘戌。緬甸民族主義者的「密切脱」黨立即向緬督柯克蘭爵士提示抗議，謂此舉有將緬甸捲入中日戰爭的危險，後來更有四條輪船載來軍火轉往中國時，遂將該項軍火用小輪沿河運至人莫，而不由國有鐵路運輸。</p>
<p>五船軍火由仰光運華的消息，使日本聞之起了恐慌。在第一批軍火抵達前，一九三八年六月的日本紀事報即講起通過緬甸運貨來華與計劃自密之那計劃造一鐵路通雲南的消息。在一九三八年的夏天，緬甸報載，日本仰光領事即發表談話謂：如果新公路作爲運輸軍火之用，日本將加以轟炸。他又警告謂，如炸彈悮擲緬境，日本不負賠償責任。雖則日本領事後來調走，雖則緬甸民族主義者　端同情中國抗戰，卻對於新公路，非常仇視。</p>
<p>雖無人敢說日本不能炸毁滇緬公路，但至少這是非常困難的事。日本的轟炸機雖至昆明，但緬甸公路及滇越鐵路並没有受過重大損害。軍事上欲從西南進達緬甸公路也是不可想像的事。自廣州或北海抵達滇緬公路，須歴一千英裏，該地盡　　之區，法國鐵路公司所屬工人，每年因　病致死者，占其總數百分之四十，除此而外，該地又爲山嶺重疊之區，大部分地帶既無公路，又無可航行的水道。日本如果要進行這一著，必須首先控制了湖南貴州，及廣西。</p>
<p>公路是目前中國與國外最重要而又有利益的交通事業。就實際上講這一條公路比之西北公路更爲有用。雖其現在的價值只不過是便於軍事上緊急之用，但其商業上的利益是無窮的。或許新公路及新鐵路的建造，使英國有了一條與中國內地直接通道，減少軍輸費用，而可與日貨竸爭，立於不敗地位。　他方面，中國除開可輪入重要軍需外，中國由之輸出的出口貨，也可以換得所需要的國外匯兑，以爲中國購買軍火之用。（完）</p>

<p>英國此舉似含交換作用　華方軍火預有大量存儲　香港抵滬英人述一般情勢</p>
<p>新近由香港抵滬之英籍商人某氏、昨對記者稱、縱令緬甸公路被封鎖三月、對於軍火運入重慶一事、並無多大之影響、因該公路每年在七八九三個月、本為「封鎖」之時期、此時沿公路之橋樑、多為猛烈之熱帶雨所蕩去、公路多處不能行駛卡車、渠在緬甸、曾數作旅行、故知之頗詳、</p>
<p>三月封鎖絕無影響該英人又稱、重慶政府對此、早有綢繆之計、故每在雨季之前、預儲充足之軍火、使軍事不致延滯、故此時封鎖緬甸路三月、實無何種重要性、渠繼稱消息靈通之英國人方面、深信緬甸路卽遭封鎖，其時期至多不過　月、但此項讓步、將緩和日本在遠東之敵對性、並有一種交換作用、足以阻止日本之貨物經大連運往德國、此等貨物、現正經由西伯利亞運往德國、其中若干、原係由美國運至日本者、而日本佔領區中所產之物品、亦有不少運往德國、</p>
<p>香港危機已不顧在該英人復稱、香港當局與消息靈通之私人方面、不信日本此時將作更將一步之要求、而對香港實施封鎖、以武力進襲香港之威脅、亦已淡去、渠稱日本若果於此時對英國宣戰、實無意義、第一、美國勢必立卽對日本實施全部禁運、而日本當不克經此打擊、第二、日本巨量之商船、將不復能維持其海上之安全、日本之信用、將立卽動搖、而再不能將其廉價之貨物向世界市塲推銷、該英商人指出日本若果向英國宣戰、卽使美國不卽與之發生衝突、而其加入軸心國家之結果、勢必失去世界貿易之市塲、職是之故、香港當局認為目下之危機、不久卽將雲散烟消、香港英籍婦孺之撤退、非出於自願、乃迫於命令、每人均以爲此舉實非必要、據稱香港當局對於撤退婦孺一事、甚至向倫敦軍部電請收回成命、</p>
<p>街市繁榮一如往昔至於香港城市之外觀、絕未改變馬路交通、依然擁擠、電影院·咖啡店等、仍有人滿之患、英國婦孺四千人之撤退、絕未使香港改觀、商業交易、一如往昔、一般談話之資料、雖爲撤退婦孺一事、但大多數人對之、並不驚異、而祗感憎惡、雖然，香港固保持鎭靜、但對於戒備性質之防禦準備、則絕不稍懈、凡年在十八與五十五間之英人、及若干其他國籍之人、均已報名爲志願軍、每星期受訓一次、並謂英國皇家海軍後備隊、亦已完全動員、</p>

<p>漁船遭風情勢危急</p>
<p>汕頭漁民八人、內有十二歲童子一人、十四日駕帆船入海、適遇颶風、桅檣傾倒、船底露洞、海水徐徐灌入、漁民無法控制、隨風飄浮、直至暮色四合、船身遭巨浪衝擊、益趨下沉、</p>
<p>綠光閃鑠黑海求援</p>
<p>是夜十一時許、該英輪破怒浪前駛、因守戰時條例、輪上暗無點火、僅甲板上有極微之綠光閃鑠、在距帆船數呎處駛過、漁民見之、急高聲呼救、輪艙旅客、爲之驚醒、</p>
<p>怒濤奔騰施救無從</p>
<p>輪長麥克雷知有人遇險、亟令停輪指揮援救工作、時四顧烏黑、僅弦月穿雲、一縷朦光、照及海上、麥克雷力圖使輪泊近半淹之帆船、船員則準備救生圈案、然海濤奔騰、帆船四度浮過輪旁、不及施救、且暗中未見漁民、唯聞海水汹湧聲中、雜有漁民之慘呼聲耳、</p>
<p>二副下艇親自搜救</p>
<p>輪長乃決定放下小艇一艘、數秒鐘內、艇已卸下吊架、復放電炬搜索、仍無所得、終放艇入海、由二副巴因斯率船員登艇冒險出發、時密雲掩月、光芒稀微、循遇險漁民之呼號聲、由小艇船員應和、進行搜索、歷二小時之久、英輪甲板上旅客屛息觀之、惟因一片墨黑、小艇已失影踪、故無所覩、</p>
<p>及時趕到　漁民脫險</p>
<p>旋見二副電炬閃閃、叢出獲救信號、蓋小艇終已及時趕到、救出漁民、而移時帆船卽吿沉沒也、待小艇駛近、風浪仍烈、幾吿傾覆、曳艇上輪、亦殊費事、三小時後、各事俱畢、英輪始繼續駛來上海、</p>
<p>衣衫酒食如慶更生時漁民精疲力竭、由該輪事務長史篤克饗以酒食、贈以衣衫漁民謂彼等自晨間五時許、卽飄流無依、有兩船駛過、皆未注意彼等遇險云、翌晨、漁民精神恢復、旅客憐之、紛紛捐助、得四百元、將以此款從滬遣送彼等返汕頭、</p>

<p>上海心理衛生促進會現在和世界紅十字會合作，創辦了一所神經系病治療院，爲實踐服務社會的精神，站在研究學術的立塲，用嶄新合理的療法，除了治療瘋病外，還改善看護的狀況，和注意出院後病人的心理衛生。</p>
<p>神經系治療院的院址是在愚園路二七一號，是處在幽靜的環境中。在後園還有一片綠油油的草地，預備給輕度精神病人，作運動塲所。院子的週圍，都值有常綠的樹木，梧桐樹芭蕉樹和紅的藍的各種顏色的花草，陪襯得治療院的氣圍，那樣的安寧。病房和餐室等，都是齊綠的顏色，凡是神經過敏或是精神狂躁的病人，由和諧幽雅的色彩，獲得鎮靜和緩和的效果。並且彷佛並不處身在醫院中，而像在家庭裏一樣的舒適和安逸。</p>
<p>神經系病治療院是一所三層樓的洋房，樓下院前是走廊上，安放着躺椅，給病人憇息之用；一間是會客室，一間餐室，一間化驗室，一間調劑配藥室；另一間是上海心理衛生促進會創辦的兒童心理指導所。</p>
<p>治療院裏每間房間的窗子都裝有鐵絲，防止病人發生不幸的慘局。在二等病房有看護日夜輪值，在頭等房間，門上裝有　洞樣的小門，這樣可以使護士時時刻刻看視病人的動態，又不妨碍病人的安寧。一切的設備如橡皮衣　帳等，都是最新式的，以防止嚴重的武癡病人狂躁的發作。</p>
<p>這以改善瘋病病人待遇爲目的的醫院，是在本年六月九日開幕，不過在五月間，實際上已收容病人；目前全院的病人有六十幾個，外籍的病人，佔三分之一。</p>
<p>院內主任醫師是上海聖約翰大學醫學院精神病學教授，兼上海心理衛生促進會專門人才委員會主席，韓芬女醫師（Ｄr.F.G.Halern）；韓芬醫師是上海著名的精神病專家。院裏的醫務主任是李邦政醫師。</p>
<p>在治療方法，除了藥劑的療法，還有心理療法，這一項包括催眠術，精神分析，和作業等方法。施行的結果，覺得它的效率確是很高的。治療院的歴史雖然很短，可是已有三個病人恢復了精神上的康健，愉快的出院了。</p>
<p>上海心裏促進會的負責人士，正在幹着這有意義有價值的社會工作；使得人類能夠造成良好的適當的心理狀態，教養和訓練克服境遇上的困難，以度正軌的精神生活。同時，指示迷失在黑暗的變態精神世界的旅客，重獲得了指南針，依照着煌耀的光輝，抵達到光明的境地去。</p>

<p>已達七審</p>

<h3 id="c92">耶蘇與人類的關係 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>「耶蘇看見許多人，就憐憫他們，因爲他們困苦流離，如同羊没有牧人一般」。這是基督教新約聖經馬太編音第九章三十六節的記載。我們從這幾句話裏，知道耶蘇對於世人的憐憫，是因爲世人「困苦」，「流離」，「如同羊没有牧人」，這的確是古今人類的三種毛病病，試分論之：</p>
<p>（一）「困苦」這兩上字原文的正確解釋是：「毫無目標的流浪，以致疲乏困累」。一個人如果將他的一生，像閑逛馬路似的，逛了熱闹的大路，再逛僻靜的小路，毫無目的，虛度一生，漠是極可悲哀的一件事。當時耶蘇看出大多數人們犯着這樣的毛病，朝秦暮楚，並無一定的目的，弄得精疲力盡，甚至生出厭世的心理，毫無生趣，真是非常的可憐</p>
<p>（二）「流離」這兩個字的原文意義是：東南西北的散播。這也是人類的一種極大毛病，人與人之間，不能互相聯絡，不能彼此表同情，不能彼此合作，各走一方，同床異梦。有人說「人類因爲生活的不同，思想的各異，殊難聯合爲一」。但基督教的聖經告訴我們，人類本是同根生，（徒十七２６）應當互相連繋，親同手足，果能如此，則干戈化為玉帛了。</p>
<p>（三）「如同羊没有牧人還是耶蘇憐憫當時的人，没有一個相當的領袖，都是瞎子領瞎子。在耶蘇的時代是如此，現在又何獨不然？各國雖都有其領袖，例如德國的希特勒，英國的邱吉爾，美國的羅斯福，意大利的墨索利尼，這些人對於他們本國，雖都各有實獻，但有誰配做全世界的領袖呢？從前法國的拿破侖，總可說是「一世之雄」了，但他一想到耶蘇的偉大，猶自歎不如。耶蘇的確是人類的真領袖，惟有他能拯救我們脱離困苦流離。</p>

<h3 id="c93">兩代之間 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>父母與子女，兩代之間的距離，充其量相差也祇不過二十幾年。在以前，時代的進展有如老牛拉着破車，二十幾年算不了一會事；可是在今日，科學與思想的突飛猛進，已經使這個二十幾年，成爲一道不可飛越的鴻溝，把父母與子女隔絕起來，成爲新與舊兩個對立的世紀的人。</p>
<p>於是兩代之間，發生了嚴重的衝突。父母說子女不孝順，不懂規矩；子女怪父母不了解，思想落伍。家庭之中，發生了無形的劇烈鬥爭。懦弱的子女在父母經濟威權的壓力下忍氣呑聲地生活着；倔强的兒女挺身起來反抗了，在不得已的時候，終於演出家庭破裂的悲劇。</p>
<p>這種新與舊的衝突，這種家庭破裂的悲劇，是不是避免得了呢？父與子，母與女間的衝突與鬥爭，是不是有終止的一天呢？</p>
<p>新舊思想的衝突，是社會演進過程中的必然現象。時代總是向前進的，有出息的青年，當然要跟着時代的潮流走。如果做父母的人，能夠跟着時代的思想前進，能夠了解子女的心理，那麼這種逆水行船的悲劇，就可以減少或消滅了。</p>
<h3 id="c94">我祝福弟弟 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— 吴望川</p>
<p>我有一個弟弟，一個值得向任何人驕傲的弟弟。我自己相信，假如我没了這弟弟，我將永久沉淪。我不能確定什麼是該做的，什麼是不該做。弟弟時常監視我，指示我，甚之責則我。我也從没對他的指正和責罰有過什麼反抗或不服，因爲他所說的常常是對的，而且不像是一個孩子所說的。我没有理由可以不聽他的話。以致父親常說我没出息，我自己也覺得没出息。</p>
<p>弟弟今年十三歲，他有一顆求真理光明的心，他幾次問我說：「你爲什麼不到西南去？」我總是回說：「身體太弱，去了准得病死。」於是他向我做一個鬼臉。</p>
<p>有一次四姨母從故鄉到上海，母親要我陪了姨母去看電影。我便高興地穿上衣服。正要下樓，不防弟弟從學校回來，問我到那裏去。母親回說看電影，並叫他也一起去。弟弟向我看了一眼，自顧自地將書包放在書案上，兩眼望着對牆，用嚴正的聲音向我說：「哥哥，你忘記了我們的公約了嗎？」</p>
<p>不錯，我確是記起我和他的九條公約中有這樣一條：「自訂約日起至抗戰勝利止，不得看電影和戲劇，有極大意義者除外。」於是我放下帽子，靠在椅子上，低了頭，在深深地懺悔。母親還在隔室促我快去我没有回答。</p>
<p>弟弟走到我身邊，輕柔地說：「哥哥，對不起，我先没有知道你是陪姨母去的，你不記得公約上說有意義的戲除外嗎？」我流淚了，我緊擁着他，我告訴他當真在先我並没有一些意思去看有意義的電影。這使我更自慚，更悔恨。弟弟卻靠了我的耳朶說：「你不去就是了。」我真覺得這太便宜了我，太將我放縱了。</p>
<p>昨天是弟弟的生日，姑姑送他一枝派克水筆，弟弟拿着非常歡喜，他向母親要了一塊絨布，仔細地拭了又拭。我冷眼在旁觀，心裏想今天該是我說：「這支筆該是外國吧！」這話立刻見了效，他滿臉地笑容都給收起，呆望着筆，我知道這傷害了他的心，我不該存報復的心來傷害他，我覺得自己太渺小，我後悔我不該說。</p>
<p>弟弟將筆交給了母親說：「你代我藏着，等我大了用。」</p>
<p>總之我弟弟就這樣地可敬，可愛。他無形中給我不少的勇氣和安慰。顯視着未來光明的前途。許多親友都說弟弟不像是個孩子，我聽了祇時刻替他暗中祝福。</p>
<h3 id="c95">不怕挫折 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— 歐麗</p>
<p>一個人的所以成爲偉人，往往不是毫無理由的。</p>
<p>據說，愛爾蘭人最不怕挫折，不怕失效，而愛爾蘭的總理凡勒拉就是一個最好的例子。</p>
<p>一九二三年的一天，凡勒拉在安尼斯城作政治演講，講到一半的時候，突然被捕下獄，監禁一年。</p>
<p>一年後出獄的時候，他立刻一直又跑到安尼斯城去繼續他未曾說完的演講。他說：「我當時被干涉而中止演講的時候，正說到……」</p>

<h3 id="c96">教會的奮興 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>有許多人說，若要復興一個城，非取消財窟和妓院不可；但上帝祇叫屬他的人，自卑，禱告，尋求他的面，轉離恶行，他就赦免他們的罪，和醫治他們的地。</p>
<p>俗復興中國，有三件重要的事：</p>
<p>（一）禱告　聖經說：「你若敲門就給你開門，你若祈求就蒙應許，你們得不着，是因爲不求的原故」。有一次美國西南神學院施加波博士到一個地方領奮興會當有一個婦人對他說：「博士這次的奮興會必定有很大的奮興」。施博士就問她：「你怎樣知道這次會有很大的奮進呢」？她說：「我的家庭需要奮興；我的丈夫是個酒徒，我的兒子信心軟弱了，我們的教會和本地，都需要奮興；我相信這次奮興會必有好效果，因爲和本地的人在開這奮興會之前，已經爲這會多多的祈禱了」。後來這會有一百九十八個人歸向基督，和奉獻爲主作工，施博士每次提起這奮興會的成功，都稱贊這個婦人的禱告。</p>
<p>（二）奉獻的生活有一次在汽車上遇見一位青年，我問他：「你是不是基督徒」？他說：「我不是基督徒，但我是　會教友」。又有一次在火車上遇見另外一位青年，我也問他：「你是不是基督徒」？他說：「不是，我是監理會教友」這表明有許多教友不是真正的基督徒，若要教會需要奮興，必須有真正的基督徒才行，一年前我曾遇見一個秭妹，她是個護士，曾在罪中過活，不久她信了耶蘇，在眾人面前承認耶蘇。去年夏天，她定志走遍全世界做得人的漁夫，從前她没有力量，現在有力量，因爲她度着奉獻的生活。</p>
<p>（三）熟心　主耶蘇看見耶路撒冷就哭了，因爲那城的人不信他。今日上海有千成萬的人没有盼望，在罪恶裏生活，你們有什麼感覺呢？我們生在世界是不是爲衣食呢？如果爲這衣食而忘記拯救人靈魂，那就不對了。</p>

<p>第三章　對立的情報</p>
<p>「是的，他是李老爺的兒子，也是王小姐的表哥。前天十七那天吃中飯時，他從蘇洲來，過了一夜，昨天一清早就回去。李老爺曾親自送他上的火車。」</p>
<p>霍桑停了目光，點點頭。「好，你說下去那時王小姐跟伊的表哥在這裏談話，怎麼樣？」</p>
<p>老毛道：「那個姓趙的忽然來了。王小姐從窓口裏瞧見了他，連忙從這會客室裏出去不讓趙伯雄進來。接着伊將正門關住，又將這裏的窓帘扯滿，分明不讓姓趙的看見什麼。姓趙的吃了這個没趣，在門口站了一站，才沉着臉兒走開。」</p>
<p>我暗暗自忖道：「唉！三個還不夠，又加上了一個！這女子生前迷人的魔力真可怕啊！」</p>
<p>室中靜寂了不過一兩秒鐘的光景，老毛又自動開口了。</p>
<p>「先生，你們不要誤會這個姓趙的無論怎樣，總不會打死王小姐的。打死伊的，定是余甘棠－－－－－」</p>
<p>霍桑又第二次跳起來，這一次他的行動比先前更快。他奔到門口，施展着閃電似的手段，一手將門拉開。門外直僵僵地站着一個人，就是那女僕金梅。</p>
<p>霍桑大聲說：「金梅，做什麼？」</p>
<p>金梅的臉色灰白，兩片嘴脣有些兒顫動，伊先前的鎮靜態度，此刻已完全消逝。</p>
<p>伊訥訥地說：「我－－－我來報告－－－」</p>
<p>「報告什麼？」</p>
<p>「我知道凶手一定是趙伯雄，決不是余少爺。」</p>
<p>「你怎麼知道。」</p>
<p>「因爲王小姐失掉了這許多首飾，一定是———是——有人看想伊的錢。這定是謀財害命。余少爺家裏有錢，怎麼會幹這樣的事——？」</p>
<p>倪金壽早也跟到門口，咆哮地向伊申訴。「誰要你發表意見？你竟敢來偷聽！還不滾上去！」　　　　（四八）</p>

<h3 id="c101">從打對臺說起 <a href="#c101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>打對臺，在戲劇界裏似乎是不很多見的事，但在最近，因了電影攝製者競攝所謂民間故事，打對臺，便成了今日孤島影壇的特殊現象。</p>
<p>已往，鄉村上演春臺戲，爲了日期邀班子與吸引親衆種種原因，偶而也演出打對臺的妙劇來，主演的鄕村，固以一村的交際手腕來舖陳豪華，戲班子也無不爲了爭取觀衆而大起狠勁，於是便宜了由城鎭下鄕來聽戲的觀衆，飽受着眼福耳福與口福。記得筆者在幼年時候，鄰村甲乙二鄕，因爲打對臺釀成械鬥，結果官廳出示禁止，以後二鄕演春臺戲，得在二鄉中心地點合僱戲班子開演，那時最有名的江湖班子，自朝至暮一臺戲，取費不過五六十塊錢，但這在當時普通的鄕村上，是不敢顧問的，自此之後，因爲二鄕合儸，對於這種有名的班子，也漸漸邀請起來，當時文武鬚生小聾聲的戰宛城，小北京的盜宗卷，白鬍髭老生黄兒的掃松下書，花旦海棠紅的陰陽河，至今還是臉炙人口，以爲打對臺的意外收穫。</p>
<p>於此，筆者又記起了譚鑫培與汪笑儂的合作珠簾寨，譚與在都是當時故都數一數二的名伶，劇藝造詣，各有獨到處，可是誰也不願低首下心，民國四年，他倆不知因何緣由，竟會合作起來，在當時東安市塲，合演珠簾寨，譚起李克用，在飾程敬思，二人工力悉敵，各逞所長，美具難幷，觀衆大有「此曲祇應天上有」之感，這雖不是打對臺，而譚與在的戲路不同，可是一旦合作，挹其所長，掩己之短，珠聯璧合，又何嘗不是對於劇壇一種新貢獻呢？</p>
<p>因此，有人以爲今日孤島電影界的打對臺，可以制止粗製濫造，這自然也有一部分理由，可是攝製者假如能如以上所述化除各不相讓的成見，進而謀共同合作，那也許不難爲今日孤島影壇放一異彩！</p>

<h3 id="e1">U.S. Secretary of State Hull States: U.S. Opposes Blocking the Burma Road; Believes British Acceptance of Japanese Demands Impairs World Trade, Striking at All Nations with Interests in the Far East <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Washington – U.S. Secretary of State Hull publicly stated in an intelligence meeting yesterday that the United States opposes Britain's policy of understanding with Japan. He declared that the U.S. does not agree with Britain's decision to block the Burma Road, because the U.S. advocates the principle of free trade worldwide, and therefore does not agree with the blockade of the Burma Road. He believes that this British concession to Japan not only harms American commerce, but also hinders world trade as a whole. The U.S. government has notified London of this position. (Haitong Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington – U.S. Secretary of State Hull yesterday sought to strengthen British resistance to Japan's demand to block the Burma Road, saying the U.S. opposes any Anglo-Japanese agreement that is "difficult to guarantee." Hull's position was summarized in a formal statement answering reporters' inquiries about Anglo-Japanese negotiations. Hull indicated that Britain has not made a final decision, and he hopes to prevent Britain from reluctantly complying with Japanese demands. The U.S. government opposes the closure of any commonly used international trade routes. The closure of the Burma Road at the behest of the Japanese government is an unreasonable interference in international commerce. Recently, the Washington Daily News commented on Britain's actions regarding the Burma Road, saying that Britain's actions are an undisguised surrender to Japanese pressure. The closure of the Burma Road will weaken China's position and force China to submit to Japan, which will strike at all nations with interests in the Far East. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington – The State Department announced yesterday its opposition to the closure of world trade routes such as the Burma Road and the Vietnam Railway. Secretary of State Hull issued the following statement: When reporters asked the Secretary of State for his opinion on the British government's intention to temporarily ban certain goods from entering China via the Burma Road at the request of Japan, he stated that the U.S. government has a legitimate interest in the opening of trade routes around the world. Therefore, the U.S. believes that the embargoes that are being considered for the Burma Road and that have recently been implemented on the Vietnam Railway will create an unjustifiable impediment to world trade. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington – Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that the United States opposes the method proposed by Britain to end the Sino-Japanese War. Hull told the press that the U.S. will consider Britain's closure of the Burma Road an improper obstruction of world trade routes, and that the recent closure of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is also opposed by the United States, because the United States has a legitimate right to maintain the opening of trade routes everywhere. He also made a significant remark, saying, "Let us not forget that Britain's prohibition of the transportation of military and fire materials from Burma to China is due to Japanese demands." Since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, the policies of Britain and the United States on Asian issues have always been parallel, but judging from Hull's remarks, they have begun to diverge. The British government must be aware of the attitude of the United States, but diplomatic circles believe that although there are superficial cracks, they may not reach a serious stage. (International News Service, 17th)</p>
<p>Chicago – Official sources here believe that Secretary of State Hull's statement yesterday that the U.S. opposes the closure of the Burma Road marks the entry of the U.S. Far East policy into a phase of action. President Roosevelt, when speaking to the press yesterday, did not comment on Hull's statement. President Roosevelt declined to say whether Hull's statement conflicts with British policy. However, well-informed political and official sources say that President Roosevelt must have intended to allow Hull to lead U.S. Far East diplomacy. They also said that President Roosevelt's refusal to comment on Hull's statement sufficiently indicates the U.S. government's view that the Burma Road incident is entirely a diplomatic issue and has not risen to the level of a broad national policy issue like the situation in Europe, requiring the President to reiterate his intent. Government officials also pointed out that even though some people advocate transferring the U.S. fleet to the Atlantic, it still has great significance in the Pacific. Government officials also strongly stated that the U.S. has clearly decided to adopt an active stance on the development of the situation in the Far East and is paying attention to the history of the changes in the Japanese cabinet. Secretary of State Hull apparently believes that the U.S. will maintain its strong position in the Far East and must consider any actions by Japan that force Britain to take actions that hinder world trade. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington – From Hull's remarks, the magnitude of the U.S.'s concern about the closure of the Burma Road is evident. However, there is no indication that the U.S. is currently willing to take action to stop Japan's ambition to force Britain to participate in the blockade of China. Although the U.S. fleet is stationed in Hawaii, political observers believe that the possibility of the U.S. taking action in the name of national defense plans, such as banning the export of scrap iron or kerosene to Japan, is still remote. People are now watching the situation with interest and anxiety. The Washington Post expressed the opinions of people here on the Burma Road issue, saying that regardless of the circumstances, Britain's announced preparation to close this road is in fact a disguised surrender to Japan. Now that Britain has shown weakness, it is doubtful whether Japan will be satisfied with small concessions. Britain's attempt to preserve its interests in the Far East will only open the door to the complete loss of its interests. Japan's verbal promise to try to end the war within the next three months has not aroused optimism here, because everyone feels that since Britain has retreated and the United States is not eager to take action, Japan's peace terms will be more severe than previously implied. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma Yakichiro, in commenting on U.S. Secretary of State Hull's statement opposing the Anglo-Japanese agreement to block the Burma Road, strongly stated that the Burma Road issue is not related to the United States. Suma said, "This is a matter between Britain and Japan, and it is currently under negotiation and has nothing to do with the United States." (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Speaker of the British House of Commons Interferes with Parliamentary Questions</p>
<p>London – During today's meeting of the House of Commons, a question was raised about the settlement of the status of the Burma Road between Britain and Japan. Undersecretary of State Butler replied that the British government had recently received certain requests from the Japanese government regarding the passage of supplies through China, and that the British government had considered these requests and had made substantial progress in agreeing with the Japanese government on a specified period. News of the conclusion of an agreement can be announced at any time, Butler said. Butler also stated that a detailed statement would be issued later, and he hoped that members would not press him to answer the specific points raised. Liberal Party member Robert then asked whether the U.S. government had expressed approval or opposition to the agreed-upon approach, given the public declaration issued yesterday by U.S. Secretary of State Hull. Butler replied that he believed the U.S. declaration should be left to the Americans to interpret. Liberal Party member Mendel also rose to ask Butler if he recognized that this behavior was a compromise to the aggressor (the crowd shouted "Shameful!"), and if he thought this matter was more successful than what had been done in Munich and other places. At this point, the Speaker intervened, asking Mr. Mendel not to forget that Undersecretary of State Butler had already stated that members should not ask any further questions. Mr. Mandel did not listen and continued to speak, but Butler did not answer him. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>London – Today, after Undersecretary of State Butler reported to the British House of Commons that the Anglo-Japanese Burma Road agreement was about to be signed, the entire House was in uproar. Labour Party member Montel, immediately after the Undersecretary's speech, called the agreement shameful. Montel wanted to explain whether this agreement was superior to the Munich Conference under Britain's policy of appeasement. Although the Speaker declared that Montel's question was off-topic, Montel continued to ask, disregarding the Speaker's calls for "Order," whether the British government would reject American goods passing through the Burma Road, given that U.S. Secretary of State Hull had issued a statement that was clearly in the nature of a protest. The Undersecretary replied that he considered this statement irresponsible. Labour Party member Robert immediately considered the Undersecretary's reply unsatisfactory and said that he would still discuss this issue during the recess. The Undersecretary said that Britain had accepted Japan's demands. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>London – At today's meeting of the House of Lords, Lord Cecil raised a question asking whether the government could make a statement on the Anglo-Japanese negotiations. When answering, Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax made a brief statement in terms similar to those made by Undersecretary of State Butler in the House of Commons, and said that because of the resignation of the Japanese government, he had been in continuous official contact regarding the conclusion of an agreement, so he could not make a detailed statement at this time. He hoped to do so tomorrow. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>London – Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi told a Reuters reporter today that the Chinese people all know that Japan is deeply mired in China and cannot extricate itself, and is only engaging in intimidation. It is difficult to understand why Britain is trying to mediate the Sino-Japanese War. This move only eliminates Japan's greatest obstacle and increases its aggression against British interests in the Far East. China will not change its position under any circumstances and will not reconcile with Japan until all Japanese troops have withdrawn from China. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>London – Last night, a Reuters diplomatic correspondent learned that Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi had contacted the Foreign Office two days ago to discuss the suspension of the transport of certain goods on the Burma Road. It was reported that Ambassador Guo expressed the Chinese government's concern about the possible consequences of seeking to start general peace talks at this time, and explained that the Chinese government believed that restrictions on the passage of important goods through this road were still incompatible with Britain's responsibilities as a member of the League of Nations. The Chinese government is aware of the difficulties Britain is currently facing, but hopes that Britain will make it clear that this decision to restrict freight transport is not intended to hinder Britain's future policy towards China. According to London sources, any overall solution hoped for by the British government should only be based on a peace that can be regarded as fair and equitable in China. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>London – A Reuters diplomatic correspondent learned from informed sources that the British government is keeping Ambassador Clipper in the Soviet Union informed of the developments on the Burma Road issue and is prepared to answer any questions that the Soviet Union may raise. At the same time, the British government is also informing Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi to Britain of the progress of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations. The British government has not yet received a protest from the Chinese government, but this protest may have been sent to the British Embassy in Chongqing and is being forwarded. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Chongqing Newspapers Continue to Attack British Far East Policy</p>
<p>Chongqing – Chinese newspapers today continued to attack Britain's "weak" Far East policy and denounced "despicable British politicians" for attempting to sacrifice China in a Far East Munich in order to protect their Far East colonies. The Ta Kung Pao stated that Britain's permission for Japan to demand the closure of the Burma Road will not change Japan's determination to attack British colonies in Asia. Britain's attempt to sacrifice China in order to maintain its interests in the Far East has been shattered by the resignation of the Japanese Yonai Cabinet. Japan's participation in the European war to attack Britain is about to be realized, and the evil seeds planted by the cunning British will also bear fruit. The Central Daily News stated that regardless of whether the Burma Road closure advocated by Britain is for a period of three months or three days, Britain will lose all its prestige once it surrenders to Japan. The British Empire should know that it is now facing an imminent and comprehensive blow. The Communist Party's organ newspaper, Xinhua Daily, declared that Britain is planting evil today and will reap the evil consequences tomorrow. Japan has now begun its southward advance, with Hong Kong, Burma, India, and Singapore as its initial targets. Britain's past actions may be regretted too late. The Xinmin Pao even more vociferously cried out, "It is Britain who encouraged Japan to advance south!" (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Chinese sources here are still focused on the Anglo-Japanese negotiations. This morning, all newspapers published in prominent positions statements from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but news from London, Singapore, and Tokyo regarding this matter was not published. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Dr. Lin Bakir, Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of North Carolina, and son of a former advisor to the Chinese government, deeply lamented the closure of the Burma Road, saying that this closure has blocked the only remaining route for American goods to be transported to China. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Japanese Side Declares Closure Will Begin Today</p>
<p>Tokyo – A Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman announced the conclusion of the Burma Road agreement, saying that as a result of the negotiations, the British government will, for a period of three months beginning July 18, prohibit the transportation of munitions, ammunition, gasoline, trucks, and railway materials through Burma. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – It is reported that a compromise has been formally reached on the issue of the use of the Burma Road. This evening, British Ambassador Craigie met with Foreign Minister Arita for an hour. The terms of the compromise are not yet known. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Officials announced that the negotiations between British Ambassador Craigie and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita on the issue of closing the Burma Road have reached a final resolution, but the details of the agreement are not yet ready for announcement tonight. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Reuters learned from Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma that the negotiations regarding the Burma Road have actually been completed. The Japanese government is only awaiting a reply from London regarding the fine details from British Ambassador Craigie. The spokesman asked that he hoped that the negotiations would be concluded under the current cabinet, which remains in office pending the inauguration of the new cabinet, which is expected to be on Thursday. If the negotiations cannot be completed by that day, then the matter will be suspended. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – When a reporter asked the Foreign Ministry spokesman today what Japan's reaction was to the speech by Jones, the Deputy Governor of Malaya, the spokesman replied that, to the best of his knowledge, there were no such peace talks at present. The spokesman acknowledged that third countries, including Britain, hoped for a swift end to the Sino-Japanese War, but that the mediation expressed by the Governor of Malaya had not yet been discussed. A reporter asked whether the change of the Japanese cabinet would affect the Anglo-Japanese negotiations on the Burma Road issue. The spokesman replied no, that the negotiations had actually been completed and that British Ambassador Craigie was only awaiting instructions from London on some technical points. He hoped that Foreign Minister Arita and Craigie would hold a final conversation in time so that the matter could be resolved by the current cabinet, which is about to step down, with Britain. As for when the current cabinet will be replaced by a new cabinet, no one can predict. The spokesman then spoke of the policies of the new cabinet, saying that he expected the new cabinet's foreign and domestic policies to proceed on the basis of a new political system.

<h3 id="e2">The Change of Japanese Cabinet and the So-Called New Political Structure <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Yonai Cabinet suddenly collapsed on the 16th of this month due to a cabinet overthrow launched by the military, just six months after its establishment in mid-January. The Sino-Japanese War has just passed its third anniversary, and the Japanese cabinet has been changed four times. Among them, the Konoe Cabinet had a longer life, but it underwent more than two partial reorganizations. Since the Hiranuma Cabinet, the average tenure of each cabinet has not exceeded half a year. Japan is at war with China, and its domestic political situation is so turbulent, which is rare for a country at war.</p>
<p>To review the reasons for the collapse of the Yonai Cabinet, let's first trace its formation. After the Abe Cabinet collapsed this spring, Konoe refused to take office, and the elder statesmen were unwilling to let the military seize power. Yonai, who has always been known for his prudence, emerged to form a cabinet with somewhat conservative colors. Therefore, it had a transitional nature itself, and was disliked by the military from the beginning. Although the proportion of the military in the cabinet had relatively increased, it always lacked its well-intentioned support. In the past six months, whether in military, diplomacy, or internal affairs, Yonai has not been able to achieve more than the Abe era. Preliminary victories in the European war further aroused the great impulse of Japanese radicals, and calls for strengthening the Axis ties and changing the "non-intervention" position rose high. Although the Yonai government tried its best to adapt to this trend, vigorously pursued the southward advance, and adopted an offensive stance towards foreign countries, it ultimately failed to satisfy the wishes of the military and the general radicals. On the other hand, the rapid decline of the Japanese New Party Movement posed a serious threat to the Yonai Cabinet, which relied on the established political parties. Therefore, the collapse of the Yonai Cabinet was an inevitable fate at present.</p>
<p>However, the fall of this Yonai Cabinet is not simply a repetition of past cabinet tides, because this time the military's reason for overthrowing the cabinet is that the current cabinet lacks cooperation with the "New Political Structure Movement," and Konoe, who is the most vocal candidate for the succeeding Prime Minister, is the advocate of the so-called "New Political Structure Movement." If the past changes of cabinets were all for reasons of policy and personnel, then this cabinet tide obviously has more political system issues interspersed in it, which is a point worth paying special attention to. The so-called "New Political Structure" issue is a variant of the so-called "National Reorganization Movement" that Konoe stepped down for a year and a half ago. This is essentially a fascist movement, and the New Party Movement is its main concrete form. Since Konoe resigned from the position of President of the Privy Council, this movement has become more and more inflated. According to Konoe's talk to the Japanese press corps on the 7th of this month, its central meaning and content can be roughly summarized into the following four items:</p>
<p>1. The goal of the "New Political Structure" is not only to promote the solution of the "incident" and deal with the new international situation, but also to abandon the doctrine of rapid success and establish a permanent political system.</p>
<p>2. Reform the separated relationship between the three powers of command, legislation, and administration and the people, form a "political unification," and use the political power of the people's organizations to control the cabinet and the parliament, but do not advocate changing the constitution.</p>
<p>3. To avoid being confused with the current political situation, Konoe himself is not considering the issue of seizing power, and expresses dissatisfaction with those who regard the New Party Movement as a cabinet overthrow movement.</p>
<p>4. The order and timing of implementation have not yet been specifically determined.</p>
<p>From these outlines, we can see the magnitude of Konoe's personal ambition. He not only created the "New Order" theory that makes Japan dominate the Far East, but also fundamentally reformed the Japanese political system, preparing to unite the military, political, and legislative powers that have always been separated and place them under the control of people's organizations. However, its progress steps are moderate and gradual, and there is no preparation for the use of strong force. This is naturally a very difficult task in Japan, where military power exceeds everything and there is still a strong feudal nature in society. Only because of this, Konoe does not expect to achieve success quickly and avoids confusing it with the current political situation. Thus, it can be seen that the military's sudden uprising to overthrow the cabinet during the period when Konoe believed that the "New Political Structure" was not yet mature and vigorously advocated Konoe's assumption of the post of Prime Minister is contrary to Konoe's original intention. It is difficult to determine at present what similarities and differences the "New Political Organization" in the minds of the Japanese military has with the "New Political Structure" in Konoe's aspirations. However, the "system that unites the military, government, and people into one and takes the political power of the national organization as its heart and driving force," as Konoe touted, must not fully comply with the military fascism desired by the Japanese military. Therefore, even if the Japanese military overthrows the Yonai Cabinet at this time on the grounds of supporting the "New Political Structure," even if the second Konoe Cabinet is subsequently established, it may not be able to reduce the internal friction of the Japanese rulers and form a "political unification." Moreover, the so-called one-party movement has only received the support of some parties that are in decline. In the headquarters of the Minseito, which has a majority in the parliament, although its recently announced platform also emphasizes principles such as "completing national defense to a high degree" and "establishing a national total strength system," it does not actively express its position on the New Party Movement. As for the financial and industrial circles and the figures who actively supported the New Party Movement two years ago, they have maintained their consistent calmness. It can be seen that the objective situation of the Japanese political situation is still far away from the goal that Konoe aspires to.</p>
<p>Japan's desire for aggression has increased dramatically due to international stimulation, but Japan's strength cannot adapt to the need to increase. Its only way out is to step up domestic control in order to engage in external speculation and adventure. The collapse of the Yonai Cabinet has hinted at the decline of the Japanese conservative camp. No matter who succeeds this cabinet, at this time, it will not be able to get rid of the strong control of the military, and its foreign policy will inevitably turn to extremes. The entire national fortune of Japan will inevitably fall into a more crazy bet.</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Japanese Foreign Ministry announced that Britain has agreed to block the Burma Road to prevent the transportation of arms, ammunition, gasoline, automobiles, and railway materials to China. The blockade will last for three months, starting on July 18. Today, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and British Ambassador Craigie reached a final resolution. The solution also includes prohibiting the import of arms and other goods from Hong Kong to China. Japanese consular officials in Hong Kong and Rangoon will maintain close contact with the British authorities in those places to effectively implement the blockade. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) Japan has absolutely no right to demand that neutral countries stop exporting or passing through any goods transported to the enemy country through normal commercial trade routes. If any neutral country accepts this request, that country can be considered to have lost its neutral status. If the neutral country prohibits the export or passage of certain goods to one of the belligerents, while allowing the free transportation of the same or similar goods destined for the other belligerent, its non-neutrality is even more obvious. According to these unquestionable principles of international law, the British government's decision to stop the transportation of certain goods from the Burma Road to China has no legal basis and is indefensible. The trade relationship between China and Burma is based on the various treaties concluded between China and Britain at the end of the 19th century. These treaties contain clear provisions for the maintenance and development of the Sino-Burmese trade route. Neither party to the treaty has the right to close this trade route, whether in peacetime or wartime. According to the resolutions passed by the League of Nations on the Sino-Japanese conflict, all member states should avoid taking any actions that would weaken China's resistance and increase its difficulties in the current dispute, and consider the extent to which each member state individually assists China. According to the Japanese plan, the purpose of the Burma Road embargo is undoubtedly to weaken China's resistance and prevent other countries from assisting China. By implementing Japan's war plan in this way, the British government has completely disregarded its obligations as an important member of the League of Nations. Therefore, the British government's decision to accept Japan's request to stop transportation on the Burma Road is a violation of the principles of international law, the various Sino-British treaties, and the resolutions of the League of Nations. If anyone thinks that China will be forced to seek peace or even accept any conditions proposed by Japan after the obstruction of China's maritime trade routes, then they are making a greater mistake than this. Our long-term war of resistance against aggression is being carried out amidst various major obstacles and difficulties. Its arduous struggle can be said to be unique. However, our country has not felt discouraged at any time. Three years of arduous experience has at least made me understand that the firmer our will, the longer we support, the easier our goals will be achieved, and the more confident we will be of final victory. No matter what difficulties we encounter, we must move forward bravely. No matter who betrays me, our belief in victory will not be shaken in the slightest. (Telegraph, 16th)</p>

<p>Hong Kong. Tokyo dispatch. Konoe Fumimaro has been ordered to organize a new cabinet. He entered the Imperial Palace at 7:55 PM on the 17th and was given the mandate to form a cabinet by the Emperor. Konoe immediately accepted but requested a bit more time to organize the new cabinet. He left the palace at 8:50 PM and visited former War Minister Hata Shunroku and former Navy Minister Yoshida Zengo to discuss the candidates to succeed the War Minister and Navy Minister. Konoe Fumimaro is 49 years old this year. He became Prime Minister of Japan in June 1937, and the Sino-Japanese War broke out during his tenure. (Telegraph of the 17th)</p>

<p>Hong Kong. Tokyo dispatch. Observers with credentials here believe that the new cabinet will be formed tonight or at the latest by tomorrow morning. Konoe Fumimaro will be the successor as Prime Minister. The new cabinet will be a small cabinet with fewer members, with each member concurrently holding various secondary positions. The Yomiuri Shimbun and Nichi Nichi Shimbun newspapers both predict that the most popular candidate to succeed the War Minister is Lieutenant General Tojo Hideki, the Director-General of the Air Force. Admiral Oikawa Koshiro, Commander of the Yokosuka Naval District, will succeed the Navy Minister. Former cabinet councilor and President of the South Manchuria Railway, Matsuoka Yosuke, will succeed the Foreign Minister. Tsushima Juichi, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, or former Finance Minister Aoki Kazuo will succeed the Finance Minister. The Prime Minister will concurrently hold the position of Interior Minister. (Telegraph of the 17th)</p>

<p>Tokyo. Political figures here believed this morning that Konoe Fumimaro, the leader of Japan's only political party and former Prime Minister, would be appointed Prime Minister this afternoon to succeed General Yonai, who is currently resigning. After War Minister Hata Shunroku submitted his resignation and refused to recommend a successor, forcing the entire Yonai cabinet to resign, the Army Ministry is now firmly demanding that Konoe form a cabinet, calling it the only way to strengthen domestic institutions and accelerate the resolution of the China Incident.

<p>Tokyo. The sudden resignation of the Yonai cabinet caused great surprise here. According to Japanese sources, War Minister Hata Shunroku stated that the reason for his resignation was that the Yonai cabinet had adopted a too passive attitude towards the new political line. Hata Shunroku believes that in order to overcome difficulties, Japan must first implement domestic reforms. If Japan wants to complete the construction of the "New Order in East Asia," then the cabinet has the following obligations: (1) Unanimously support the national unity party as a prerequisite for achieving a totalitarian government; (2) National control of the economic system; (3) Issue official documents stating that in order to implement the political and economic reorganization of the Far East, the Sino-Japanese conflict must be ended.

<p>Washington. Last night, Washington officials refused to immediately comment on the Japanese cabinet's resignation before receiving a formal report from the US embassy in Japan. However, political circles believe that Japanese army and navy leaders are excited by the cabinet's resignation. Political figures believe that Japanese army and navy authorities can thus pursue a southern advance policy with greater freedom of action. They believe that the present is an unprecedented opportunity for Japan to expand its influence in the Far East. Well-informed sources believe that if Konoe Fumimaro, leader of the Japanese unity party movement, is appointed the new Prime Minister, he will use his agility and far-sightedness to lead Japan's expansionist tendencies. However, observers here indicate that Japan is bound to take some sensational action. They say the US continues to pay particular attention to any actions toward the Dutch East Indies and British Malaya, as the US obtains rubber and tin from these two places. They believe that Japan's recent proposal to blockade Vietnam and the trade route between Burma and Chongqing is a powerful threat to the Dutch East Indies and British Malaya. They believe that Japan's intensification of the war against China indicates that the Japanese army is eager to end the China Incident in preparation for a southern advance.

<p>Washington. The US Department of Commerce recently announced that US-China trade in the first five months of 1940 has improved significantly compared to the same five-month period in 1939, while exports to Japan continue to decline. The total amount of US-China trade in the first five months of 1940 was nearly US$35,000,000, exceeding the same five-month period in 1939 by about US$15,000,000. US exports to China during the same period exceeded last year by 86%, totaling US$39,000,000. US exports to Japan continue to decline. The total export amount in April this year was US$15,271,000, and in May it was US$13,721,000, which is even worse compared to May last year, as the export amount in May last year was US$21,400,000. US exports to Japan in the first five months of 1939 were US$96,300,000, while US exports to Japan in the same period this year decreased to US$91,524,000. Exports of cotton, copper, aluminum, airplanes, and machinery to Japan all decreased in May. The amount of Japanese goods shipped to the US was US$8,760,000 in April and US$9,283,000 in May. The total amount of Japanese goods shipped to the US in the first five months of this year was US$57,573,000, which is more than US$7,000,000 more than the same period in 1939. This increase is the result of increased raw silk prices. (United Press telegraph of the 17th)</p>

<p>Chicago. Yesterday was the second day of the Democratic National Convention held here. Secretary of Labor Perkins spoke, and everyone expected Roosevelt to be nominated for a third term as president. However, President Roosevelt remained silent on his own plans. Yesterday's convention had few attendees, and the delegates showed little interest in the proceedings. It will not be until the election begins tomorrow that their spirits will be invigorated. Yesterday's meeting began with a prayer for peace in the United States and the world. Then, Mrs. McAlester, director of the women's department of the Democratic National Committee, gave an isolationist speech, stating that as women, they are opposed to war. The people of the New World should not have the racial, class, and religious hatreds that have turned the Old World into a slaughterhouse. The United States will never compromise with dictators, nor will it yield to threats. The general speeches were mostly similar. As for the suggestion that every effort should be made to assist the people fighting for freedom, it was rarely mentioned, as the Democratic Party had to appease a minority of isolationists who were even stronger than those of the Republican Party. When Senator Barkley accepted the position of permanent chairman of the convention, he asked the convention to fight for President Roosevelt's outstanding achievements in national defense and foreign policy, saying that anyone who attacks our territorial independence, interests, or anything we are responsible for defending, whether it comes from within or from without, we must resolutely resist it. (Reuters telegraph of the 17th)</p>
<p>Chicago. Senator Barkley announced to the Democratic National Convention that President Roosevelt had relinquished his right to seek a third term. Barkley stated that he (the President) wanted to make it clear that delegates were free to elect anyone as a presidential candidate, thus Roosevelt opened the door for his election as president.

<p>Chicago. President Roosevelt's number one advisor predicted today that Roosevelt would be re-elected in the first vote at tomorrow's Democratic election. The advisor said that Farley would get 65 or 70 votes, and Garner would also get that number. Republican candidate Willkie will also get some votes. It is rumored that the Democratic subcommittee advocates non-intervention and does not agree with President Roosevelt's proposal to give all possible assistance to European democracies. It is rumored that President Roosevelt will use this platform as the preface to his entire program, but opposition has arisen from the subcommittee. It is expected that Roosevelt will dissolve all the representatives who have sworn allegiance to him in his third term. After the representatives are dissolved, Roosevelt will allow the convention to freely choose its candidates, but it will not prevent his re-election.

<p>Chicago. Former High Commissioner to the Philippines McNutt's chances of running for Democratic Vice President immediately increased after the Trust Committee gave six seats to the six Philippine representatives at today's meeting. Another vice presidential candidate is Senator Barkley from Kentucky, whose chances of being elected have been well-known since his speech last night. He advocated continued support for Roosevelt and his policies, reiterating the promise to strengthen the defense of the Americas and to fully assist the Allies. At the same time, the convention eagerly anticipates the convention to be held on Thursday, as the formal nomination of the President and Vice President will begin at that time. It is expected that Roosevelt will be elected on his first ballot because he has 90 percent of the delegates. New York Governor Lehman, who will draft the Democratic platform's foreign policy clauses, spoke with President Roosevelt on the phone yesterday, informing him of the isolationist sentiment and urging him to give Britain all possible material assistance within the law to resist dictators.

<p>London: Regarding the recent permission granted by the Swedish government for German troops and military supplies to transit through Sweden to Norway, Under-Secretary Butler stated in the House of Commons that the British government has informed the Swedish authorities that this matter is of grave concern, and that this action contradicts its neutral policy. Norwegian officials here also stated that their government believes the Swedish authorities' sudden decision violates the Hague International Accords, and has therefore protested to the Swedish government. It is noted that after the outbreak of the Norwegian war in April of this year, Sweden had once banned the transit of military supplies to Norway. Now, it suddenly allows German troops and military supplies to pass through. Such a cunning and duplicitous measure cannot but be protested. Perhaps the Swedish authorities argue that the Nordic war has ended, but such a theory is untenable. In fact, the Norwegian war of independence has not ended, as evidenced by King Haakon VII's refusal to abdicate. In essence, Sweden's allowing German troops and military supplies to pass through is tantamount to aiding the evildoer, only serving to assist Germany in expanding its occupied territory.

However, the Swedish government believes that the Norwegian war has ended and that it is unnecessary to continue implementing various restrictions against belligerent nations.

This matter reached its climax on June 27th, when several speakers publicly insulted Spain and its leader Franco in front of the Chilean President in the largest square in the Chilean capital. The Spanish government's protest was met with insincere excuses from the Chilean government.

<p>Rome: Although there has been no official announcement regarding the rumors that Ciano will be reciprocating a visit to Berlin, informed sources confirmed today that he will arrive in Berlin on Friday (the 19th). (Hai Jun, 17th)</p>
<p>Rome: Reliable Italian sources indicated today that the decision to pursue peace or continue the war with Britain will be made in Berlin this week. Britain's own attitude is a key factor in determining this. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will travel to Berlin today for important consultations with Hitler, after which Germany and Italy will ask Britain, "Surrender completely or face destruction?"

<p>London: A Reuters correspondent in Southern Ireland reported that more war discussions are heard in Dublin in a single day than in London in a week. Every possibility is discussed. The calm attitude of the British people is unprecedented here. The majority of the Irish people pray for British victory and are determined to resist. Their primary concern is that the entire nation of Germany has voluntarily joined the local defense forces to protect the coast and patrol for paratroopers. In a village near Limerick, rumors spread that the Germans had landed in the north. The villagers chopped down trees to block the roads and planned to destroy major bridges. However, the rumors were dispelled by someone. The Irish Republican Army has been silent recently. Most of its leaders have been detained. Military sources believe that the IRA has the potential to cause trouble, but there are few party members. Defense preparations are proceeding rapidly, but there is no sign of cooperation with Northern Ireland or Britain. Although Southern Ireland does not want to join the war at this time, it is generally recognized that Southern Ireland shares the same fate as Britain. However, according to Southern Irish sources, a unified Ireland maintaining neutrality would be more beneficial to Britain than a disunited Ireland joining the war and becoming a victim of aggression.

<p>Rome: Italian officials announced that Italian forces have achieved their first major victory in Africa since the beginning of the war. The famous Dolo Salient, shaped like a crescent, extending from Kenya to Abyssinia and Italian Somaliland, has now been cut off by Italian forces. In this operation, Italian forces have occupied four strategically important locations, connecting the main military centers in southern Abyssinia and southern Italian Somaliland into a straight line. It is estimated that this route will save 300 kilometers of travel, which is very important for Italian military transport. Military circles here generally believe that this shortening of the transportation line will enable Italian forces to take a more active offensive against the area around Kenya, including Moyale, where a large number of British troops are stationed, as well as many natives and soldiers from the former Abyssinian royal army. According to Italian dispatches, the Italian forces cutting off the Dolo Salient included regular troops, Blue Shirts, and native troops, assisted by a camel corps, a number of motorized units, and a number of tanks. In the hottest days of this summer, it was reported that refrigerated trucks were used to transport soldiers to combat the heat. The cutting off of the Dolo Salient can also protect an important highway built by General Graziani, commander of the Italian East African forces, during the Abyssinian war. This highway passes through Dolo to Mogadishu and Nageli. In Nageli, there are branch roads to Addis Ababa and Kima. Since Italy's entry into the war, British forces have reportedly repeatedly attacked Dolo in an attempt to cut off this highway, which is the main artery connecting Abyssinia and Italian Somaliland.

<p>Rome: Regarding the Italian air force bombing of Haifa, an important British naval and air base and the terminus of oil pipelines in Palestine: Italian aircraft had to fly for five hours to reach Haifa and avoid the British reconnaissance station on Cyprus. In addition, there were obstacles of visibility and semi-tropical temperatures. When Italian aircraft arrived at Haifa, British anti-aircraft guns along the coast and mountains immediately opened dense fire, but Italian aircraft still attacked oil depots and airfields. All targets were hit and caught fire. When British fighters took off to intercept, Italian aircraft had already completed their mission. The success of the Italian air force was remarkable, as Haifa Port is hundreds of kilometers away from the nearest Italian air force base. On the return journey, the aircraft personnel could still see the flames of the oil pools in the distance. (Haitong dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e38">The Past and Present of the China-Burma International Transportation Route <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Currently, the 150 miles from Lashio to the Chinese border prohibit heavy trucks from passing during the day, but private cars can travel freely along the entire route. The bridges spanning the Mekong and Salween Rivers are modern bridges made of copper and iron. In fact, transportation is not limited to one road, except for the narrow valleys between rivers. The main road is 100 miles south of Tengyue, but another road to Bhamo passes through Tengyue city. Similarly, within Burma, vehicles can reach the Chinese border via the rail lines outside Namhkam, Muse (transliteration), and Kunlong ferry. There is also a road via Kaitong (transliteration), which is longer than the other roads, and further north, many vehicles come from Myitkyina, the terminus of the railway.</p>
<p>The Chinese are dissatisfied with the transportation on the Burma Road and have begun building a railway. The section from Kunming to Chuxiong is expected to be completed in July of this year. According to recent news, Chairman Chiang has ordered the completion of the section from Chuxiong to the Burmese border this year. The Chinese engineering office estimates that the cost of building the railway within China, including 200 tunnels, will be £4 million. If this road is completed, it can carry 300 tons of cargo per day, a volume no less than that of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway.</p>
<p>Six months after construction began on the new highway, the British ship Stanholme carried 6,000 tons of Soviet munitions from Odessa to Rangoon for transshipment to China. In October 1938, the munitions were unloaded from the ship and transported to Lashio. The Burmese nationalist "Dobama Asiayone" party immediately protested to Burmese Governor Sir Cochrane, stating that this action risked drawing Burma into the Sino-Japanese war. Later, when four more ships arrived with munitions for transshipment to China, the munitions were transported by small boats along the river to Bhamo instead of being transported by the state railway.</p>
<p>The news of five ships of munitions being transported from Rangoon to China alarmed Japan. Before the first shipment of munitions arrived, the Japan Chronicle reported in June 1938 on the news of transporting goods to China through Burma and the plan to secretly build a railway from Myitkyina to Yunnan. In the summer of 1938, Burmese newspapers reported that the Japanese consul in Rangoon had stated that if the new highway was used for transporting munitions, Japan would bomb it. He also warned that Japan would not be responsible for compensation if bombs were mistakenly dropped on Burmese territory. Although the Japanese consul was later transferred, and although Burmese nationalists sympathized with China's resistance, they were very hostile to the new highway.</p>
<p>Although no one dares to say that Japan cannot destroy the Burma Road, it is at least very difficult. Although Japanese bombers have reached Kunming, the Burma Road and the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway have not suffered significant damage. It is also unimaginable militarily to advance from the southwest to reach the Burma Road. It is 1,000 miles from Guangzhou or Beihai to reach the Burma Road, a region full of miasma, where 40% of the workers of the French railway company die each year from miasma-related diseases. In addition, the area is mountainous, and most of the area has no roads or navigable waterways. If Japan were to carry out this move, it would first have to control Hunan, Guizhou, and Guangxi.</p>
<p>The highway is currently the most important and beneficial transportation undertaking between China and foreign countries. In practice, this highway is more useful than the Northwest Highway. Although its current value is only for emergency military use, its commercial benefits are infinite. Perhaps the construction of the new highway and new railway will provide Britain with a direct passage to the Chinese interior, reducing transportation costs and allowing it to compete with Japanese goods and stand on an invincible position. On the other hand, in addition to importing important military supplies, China can also export goods to earn the foreign exchange needed to purchase munitions for China. (End)</p>

<p>A telegram from Ningbo yesterday stated that at 8:00 AM "Ning'an," and at 4:00 PM "situation tense," "evacuate the population." It was also reported that after Japanese troops began military operations in Hangzhou Bay, they landed on barren islands such as Qiliji, attempting to land at Zhenhai. However, they were fiercely repelled by the garrisoned troops and have not succeeded. A large Chinese army is gathered along the coast and river, taking emergency measures and declaring a state of special alert. Defenses are exceptionally solid. People in Ningbo and other places are calm. It is understood that Qiliji is a barren island with a customs lighthouse located seven miles from the entrance to Zhenhai Port, and has no military significance.</p>
<p>Japanese Warship Hit in Zhenhai Naval Battle</p>
<p>A reporter from the Datong News Agency obtained reliable information from the shipping industry that a fierce naval battle occurred again yesterday morning at Zhenhai Port. Six Japanese planes also took off from the Longshan area and dropped bombs on the Zhenhai fortress area of Zhaobao Mountain and Jinji Mountain. However, all bombs landed in open areas and caused no major damage. According to a reporter from the Dazhong News Agency who learned from a ship's crew member who arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo the night before last, at 5:30 AM on the 16th, when the ship was about to enter Zhenhai Port, they saw about ten Japanese warships and more than thirty motorboats lined up in the Longshan to Zhenhai area. At that time, a Japanese warship, seeing a ship approaching, immediately signaled for it to stop. After a while, a Japanese motorboat carrying seven Japanese soldiers approached the ship. Four soldiers boarded the ship to inspect it and notified the shipowner, saying, "War is about to break out, leave quickly." Fortunately, the ship had already unloaded its cargo, so it turned around and sailed to Shanghai. Immediately afterward, a huge rumbling sound was heard, like a string of pearls. Four Japanese planes circled over Zhenhai, dropping bombs. Suddenly, a deafeningly loud cannon shot was heard, fired from the Zhenhai battery. Following that was a huge explosion. A Japanese warship was seen to have been hit by the Chinese, and its hull was tilting as if about to sink. The warship next to it approached to rescue it and assist it in sailing away. At this time, the ship had gradually sailed away, and the density of Japanese warship gunfire also decreased sharply.</p>
<p>Rumors of Results in Italian Consulate Negotiation</p>
<p>Since the Japanese military announced the blockade of the coastal ports of Zhejiang and Fujian, the impact on British and Italian shipping merchants has been even greater. Shipping merchants from various countries in this port gathered separately to discuss and request their respective consuls-general in Shanghai to negotiate for the resumption of navigation. Therefore, the British Consulate presented a strong protest, but as of yesterday, there were still no results. However, according to authoritative sources in the shipping industry, after the Italian Consulate negotiated with the Japanese side, they claimed that the blockade was temporary in nature. Once the military operations in Zhenhai cease, there is hope for the resumption of navigation. According to The Times, regarding the sudden decision by the Japanese side to blockade the Zhejiang and Fujian coasts, the British authorities filed a strong protest on Sunday, and are now watching the development of the situation. Naval authorities at the British Embassy have not issued any critical messages, reportedly because it is too early. The British authorities have not instructed British ships not to sail to the blockaded ports, but it is generally expected that ships will not go.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Gather in Zhoushan Waters</p>
<p>Furthermore, a telegram received yesterday from relatives in Ningbo stated that the waters off Andong in Yuyao were also reportedly bombarded by Japanese warships. The Shaoxing Seven Counties Association stated that they had not received reliable reports of the bombardment of Yuyao by Japanese warships. As for Shaoxing, it is said to be peaceful, and no disturbing news has been heard. In addition, Japanese warships have suddenly gathered near Weitou Port in Dinghai on the Zhoushan Islands, seemingly intending to use Dinghai as a base for harassing the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang. According to telegrams received by the shipping industry, there are currently a total of five large and small Japanese warships and one aircraft carrier anchored in the waters around Zhoushan Island. The Kushimao Unit of the Japanese naval landing forces stationed in Dinghai city is also frequently deployed, and on the 11th, they took a ship to spy on Chuanshan in Zhenhai. Recently, reinforcements have continued to arrive, planning to depart from Dinghai and invade eastern Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Emergency Measures for Defenses Along All Rivers</p>
<p>The Japanese troops entrenched in Fuyang and Xiaoshan are trying to make trouble again. Japanese troops in Fuyang are attempting to secretly cross the Fuchun River, and Japanese troops in Xiaoshan are attempting to advance south along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Chinese troops in various locations are standing by, ready to strike hard. It is reported that the × Army Group × Commander-in-Chief has ordered his subordinates to be on strict alert and to strengthen the blockade of the Yong River, Jiao River, and Ou River. The Jiang Defense Commander on the south bank of the Qiantang River has adopted emergency measures.</p>
<p>Ningbo Reports on Previous Battle Situation</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Ningbo to the Shanghai Ningbo Community, the circumstances of the Japanese aircraft and warships harassing Zhenhai on the 16th are as follows: Twenty-three Japanese warships fired more than 200 shells at Zhenhai, and six Japanese planes dropped 71 bombs on the Zhenhai fortress area, all of which landed in the open fields. We suffered no losses. Japanese warships in Hangzhou Bay also shelled Andong, a coastal town in Yuyao, the day before yesterday, but the extent of the damage has not yet been reported. As of last night, the Japanese warships outside Zhenhai Port were still lingering and have not left, and transport ships have arrived, their intentions are difficult to predict. According to foreign ship crew members who arrived in Shanghai, when the ship arrived at Ligang, they discovered eight Japanese warships anchored outside the port, and later three more arrived, totaling eleven. In addition, there were more than ten transport ships, all fully loaded with Japanese soldiers, as well as small motorboats. Judging by the Japanese's attitude, they seem to have landing intentions. Inside Ningbo Port, there is a German merchant ship, the "Kaysersten," owned by Jebsen &amp; Co., which is being repaired in Ningbo and therefore cannot leave. It is currently blockaded in Ningbo.</p>
<p>Ewo Liners Sail to Fujian as Usual</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Fujian liners, including the four Ewo Line ships of British Merchants, "Sinfuk," "Sinhwa," "Sinwoo," "Sina," etc., except that "Sinwoo" and "Sina" have safely arrived in Quanzhou, the "Sinfuk" and "Sinhwa" are staying in Shanghai. According to a reporter from the Ping Ming News Agency who inquired with the company, the matter of the company's ships suspending services has been discussed and agreed upon by the relevant authorities with the Japanese side. The ships are sailing as usual. "Sinfuk" is scheduled to leave Shanghai at 8:00 AM today to sail to Xinghua Bay in Fujian, and customs clearance was completed yesterday. It will sail to Fujian this morning. The "Sinhwa," which is currently in Shanghai, will also sail to Xinghua, Fujian, within the next week.</p>
<p>Food Transported to Shanghai Will Not Be Intercepted</p>
<p>Shanghai Times says that, as of yesterday (the 16th), the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces has been blockaded by the Japanese Navy since midnight on Monday, and Shanghai will not be greatly affected. The supply of fresh fruits, vegetables, and poultry will also not be cut off. According to those who supply food to the two concessions, Shanghai has been shipping in fresh fruits and vegetables from the mouth of the Yangtze River, and poultry has been coming from the Nanjing area for months. If the Japanese decide to include fish in the blockade, then Shanghai will likely experience a fish shortage.</p>
<p>Ticket Refunds Begin Yesterday for Suspended Ships</p>
<p>Refunds for tickets sold for the four ships that were suspended from sailing from Shanghai to Ningbo the day before yesterday began yesterday. The loaded cargo remains in the ships. However, the "Changde," a ship managed by the Jufeng Customs Brokerage and leased from the Italian merchant Roche Company, has suffered heavy losses since the suspension of service, so it plans to unload the cargo and return the ship to the shipowner. However, there is a shortage of warehouses, so it is currently seeking to rent one.</p>

<p>In the past two days, a rumor has been circulating in Shanghai that British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr left Shanghai for Chongqing the day before yesterday. According to inquiries made by reporters to the British Embassy, a spokesperson for the embassy firmly denied this, saying, "The Ambassador is currently working in Shanghai as usual. The rumor of his trip to Chongqing is absolutely inaccurate, as the Ambassador currently has no plans to leave Shanghai. As for the Ambassador's wife, she has left Shanghai for Beidaihe to escape the summer heat."</p>
<h3 id="e41">No Discussion Yesterday Between Both Parties Regarding Japanese Military Police Incident; Japan Demands Sincere Measures From US; Joint Statement May Be Released Today <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The North China Daily News says that there is no prospect of an imminent resolution to the accidental incident between the US Marines and Japanese Military Police on July 7. According to well-informed sources yesterday (the 16th), Major General Miura, commander of the Japanese Military Police, and Colonel Baker, commander of the 4th US Marine Regiment, met yesterday but there was no new development. At yesterday's meeting, Major General Miura pointed out that sixteen plainclothes Japanese Military Police officers were mistreated by US soldiers in this case, and insisted that the responsible US authorities should take sincere measures to resolve the case. It is reported that as of yesterday, the Japanese side had not received a satisfactory response, so the problem remains unresolved. Observers say that the developments in the next few days are of particular significance. The China Press says that Colonel Baker and Major General Miura have not yet issued a joint statement on this matter, but it will likely be released tomorrow (the 18th). The two did not continue discussions this morning.</p>
<p>Filipino Americans Take a Stern Attitude</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy said last night at a reception for journalists that the declaration by US residents in Manila requesting Colonel Baker to issue greater authority in the case of the arrest of Japanese Military Police on the third week anniversary of July 7 is considered by the Japanese authorities in Shanghai to be unhelpful in resolving the case, but rather makes the situation even more serious. The spokesperson believes that the mistreatment of the sixteen Japanese Military Police officers should be carefully handled. When asked by reporters whether the meeting of Japanese people in Hongkou was "helpful" in resolving the case, the spokesperson replied that the meeting of Japanese people in Hongkou and the meeting of Americans in Manila are different. The Americans in Manila telegraphed US Secretary of State Hull and Colonel Baker, but the meeting of Japanese people in Hongkou expressed the emotions of Japanese residents in Shanghai, and Shanghai is more familiar with the situation in this case than Manila. The Japanese military spokesperson continued that the meeting between Colonel Baker and Commander Miura is still in progress, but stated that no statement has been issued.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Closure of Yunnan-Burma Road Does Not Affect Chinese Military <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>British Move Seems to Contain Exchange Effect; Chinese Military Has Large Stockpile of Munitions; British People Arriving in Shanghai From Hong Kong Describe the General Situation</p>
<p>A certain British merchant who recently arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong told reporters yesterday that even if the Burma Road is closed for three months, it will not have much impact on the transport of munitions to Chongqing. This is because the road is "closed" for three months every year in July, August, and September. At this time, many of the bridges along the road are washed away by intense tropical rains, and many sections of the road cannot be used by trucks. He has traveled to Burma several times, so he knows it quite well.</p>
<p>No Impact From Three-Month Closure</p>
<p>The British person also said that the Chongqing government has planned for this for a long time, so it stores enough munitions before each rainy season so that military operations will not be delayed. Therefore, closing the Burma Road for three months at this time is not of much importance. He continued that well-informed British sources believe that even if the Burma Road is closed, the period will be no more than a month. However, this concession will ease Japan's hostility in the Far East and provide an exchange effect, enough to prevent Japanese goods from being transported to Germany via Dalian. These goods are currently being transported to Germany via Siberia, some of which were originally shipped from the United States to Japan, and many products produced in Japanese-occupied areas are also being transported to Germany.</p>
<p>Crisis in Hong Kong No Longer Considered</p>
<p>The British person also said that the Hong Kong authorities and well-informed private sources do not believe that Japan will make further demands at this time or impose a blockade on Hong Kong, and the threat of a military attack on Hong Kong has also faded. He said that it would be meaningless for Japan to declare war on Britain at this time. First, the United States would immediately impose a full embargo on Japan, and Japan would not be able to withstand this blow. Second, Japan's massive merchant fleet would no longer be able to maintain its maritime security. Japan's credit would immediately falter, and it would no longer be able to sell its cheap goods on the world market. The British merchant pointed out that if Japan declared war on Britain, even if the United States did not immediately enter into conflict with it, its entry into the Axis powers would inevitably lead to the loss of the world trade market. Therefore, the Hong Kong authorities believe that the current crisis will soon dissipate. The evacuation of British women and children from Hong Kong was not voluntary, but was ordered, and everyone thought that this move was unnecessary. It is said that the Hong Kong authorities even telegraphed the London War Office to request the revocation of the order for the evacuation of women and children.</p>
<p>Street Market Prosperous As Before</p>
<p>As for the appearance of Hong Kong city, it has not changed at all. Road traffic is still crowded. Movie theaters, cafes, etc., are still overcrowded. The evacuation of 4,000 British women and children has not changed Hong Kong at all. Business transactions are as usual. Although the evacuation of women and children is a common topic of conversation, most people are not surprised by it, but rather resent it. Although Hong Kong remains calm, it does not slacken its defensive preparations of a precautionary nature. British people between the ages of eighteen and fifty-five, and some other nationalities, have registered as volunteers and receive training once a week. It is said that the British Royal Naval Reserve has also been fully mobilized.</p>

Therefore, rice prices at various stalls are expected to continue to decline.</p>

<p>High tides will occur in the Huangpu River starting on the 19th. According to the Huangpu River Conservancy Bureau, the height is predicted to be around eleven feet. Currently, there is a hurricane in the Pacific Ocean, and if it coincides with the high tides, Shanghai will face a fairly serious flood. Therefore, riverside godowns and warehouses have attracted attention, and flood defense works have been strengthened.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Observatory, the Pacific hurricane reached 16 degrees north latitude and 138 degrees east longitude at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, and then entered a stagnant state. At 6:00 AM yesterday, it was still lingering in the same place. The center of the storm is large, within 120 nautical miles. The strength of the wind is unknown. Its development is currently being monitored.</p>

<p>The chairman of the Indian Church, Jai Singh Bhai, arrived in Shanghai yesterday aboard the President Adams mail ship from the United States. He told reporters that if Britain is not subdued by Germany, India will remain loyal to the British Empire. Indians hate British imperialism, but they abhor Hitlerism even more. Although we have not given up the struggle for independence, we do not want to be conquered by Germany, Soviet Russia, or Japan. Mr. Jai said that this view represents the most powerful view among Indian leaders. In other words, India's immediate priority is defense, and independence is not yet the time. He said that if Britain collapses, India will be unimaginable. Therefore, for India's sake, it is hoped that Britain will win, and after the war ends, the British will eventually give India dominion status, and then complete independence. If India wants to be independent, it must first be unified. Christianity is a factor in helping India to unite. Ten years ago, there were eight million Christians in India, double the number of twenty years ago, and it is still increasing. Christianity not only represents a new spirit in India, but also an economic and social revolution.</p>

<p>The Municipal Council issued a report that after the war, secondary landlords have raised rents, according to the cost of living index, to a high increase of 205%. The authorities have paid close attention to it. All parties deeply hope that the excessive profits of secondary landlords can be strictly restricted in the future. The authorities should also avoid excessively high valuations of certain houses for tax purposes, so that the rent problem can be gradually adjusted and restore a reasonable normality.</p>

<p>The North China Daily News says that a British ship arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday (the 16th). Passengers described the heroic rescue of eight Shantou fishermen from a sinking ship by the ship's crew members before dawn on the 15th, and their admiration was overflowing. The story is as follows:</p>
<p>Fishing Boat in Critical Situation Due to Storm</p>
<p>Eight Shantou fishermen, including a twelve-year-old child, sailed out to sea on a sailboat on the 14th. They encountered a hurricane, the masts collapsed, and there was a hole in the bottom of the boat. The fishermen could not control the boat and drifted with the wind. Until dusk, the boat was hit by huge waves and sank further.</p>
<p>Green Light Flickers, Seeking Help in the Black Sea</p>
<p>At about 11:00 PM that night, the British ship was sailing through the angry waves. Due to wartime regulations, no lights were on the ship, and only a very faint green light flickered on the deck. It passed a few feet away from the sailboat. The fishermen saw it and shouted for help. The passengers in the hold were awakened by the shouts.</p>
<p>Raging Waves Made Rescue Impossible</p>
<p>Captain MacCleay, knowing that someone was in danger, quickly ordered the ship to stop and directed the rescue work. At this time, everything was dark, and only a crescent moon pierced through the clouds, with a glimmer of light illuminating the sea. MacCleay tried to bring the ship close to the half-submerged sailboat, and the crew prepared lifebuoys. However, the waves were raging, and the sailboat floated past the ship four times, and it was impossible to rescue them. The fishermen were not seen in the darkness, and only the mournful cries of the fishermen were heard amid the sound of the surging sea.</p>
<p>Second Mate Leads Small Boat for Personal Search and Rescue</p>
<p>The captain decided to launch a small boat. Within seconds, the boat was lowered from the davits and a searchlight was turned on, but still nothing was found. Finally, the boat was put into the sea, and the second mate Bains led the crew to embark on a dangerous mission. At that time, dense clouds covered the moon, the light was faint, and the small boat crew responded to the cries of the fishermen and conducted a search. After two hours, the passengers on the deck of the British ship watched with bated breath, but because it was completely dark, the small boat had disappeared, so nothing could be seen.</p>
<p>Arriving in Time, Fishermen Escaped Danger</p>
<p>Then, the second mate's searchlight flashed, sending out a signal of rescue. The small boat had finally arrived in time to rescue the fishermen, and the sailboat sank shortly after. When the small boat approached, the wind and waves were still fierce, and it almost capsized. Towing the boat onto the ship was also very difficult. After three hours, everything was completed, and the British ship continued to sail to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Clothes, Wine, and Food Like Celebrating a New Life</p>
<p>The fishermen were exhausted, and the ship's purser, Stokes, treated them with wine and food and gave them clothes. The fishermen said that they had been drifting aimlessly since 5:00 AM, and two ships had passed by, but they had not noticed that they were in danger. The next morning, the fishermen recovered their spirits, and the passengers took pity on them and donated 400 yuan, which will be used to send them back to Shantou from Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Japanese Merchants Plan to Merge Docks; Shanghai Municipal Council Protests; This Action Impedes the Use of Public Docks; However, the Japanese Have Already Built a Wall at the Intersection of Edinburgh Road <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The China Press says that a spokesperson for the Municipal Council told reporters this morning (the 17th) that the Municipal Council has protested to the Japanese authorities in Shanghai regarding the Japanese plan to merge the Japanese docks along Yangshupu Road. This action will prevent the public from freely entering and exiting the public docks between the docks of the Japan, Osaka, and Dairen Steamship Companies. When asked if the Japanese military authorities had blocked Edinburgh Road from the Edinburgh Public Dock to Yangshupu Road, the spokesperson replied in the affirmative. The Japanese authorities have built a wall at the intersection of Edinburgh Road, preventing the public from using the Edinburgh Public Dock. The Japanese authorities took this step without the permission of the Public Council. As for the Japanese newspaper report that Japanese shipping companies have negotiated with the Municipal Council to purchase the Public Docks, it is inaccurate because the Japanese side has never consulted the Bureau. According to a Japanese newspaper report earlier this week, Japanese merchants had negotiated with the Municipal Council to purchase the Public Docks along Yangshupu Road in order to carry out a plan to merge the most important Japanese commercial docks in Shanghai.</p>

<p>The North China Daily News says that on Monday night, the Shanghai Municipal Police Department of the Public Concession detained a Japanese Military Police officer and three Chinese people on Medhurst Road because of threats to tenants in a house on that road who refused to increase rent. The arrested Japanese Military Police officer was handed over to the military police headquarters by the Police Department. The three Chinese people were tried in the Special No. 1 Court yesterday and adjourned for 15 days. The incident was due to a secondary landlord of a house on Medhurst Road in the US military housing area deciding to increase the rent. The three subtenants refused to pay the rent. On July 8th, the secondary landlord actually instigated a sergeant of the Japanese Military Police team to go with four Chinese people to warn the three subtenants, saying that if they did not pay the rent, they would encounter trouble, and then left. The matter was still unresolved. On Monday night, the military police officer returned to the house with the three Chinese people to threaten the three subtenants. The Sinza Police Station received a report and sent officers to arrest the Japanese Military Police officer and the Chinese people. The Japanese Military Police officer was handed over to the Japanese authorities, and the three arrested Chinese people were prosecuted in the Special No. 1 Court.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the parcel post section of the post office posted a notice stating, "For notification purposes, it has been found that recently, there have been packages wrapped in hemp cloth submitted to this section for mailing. This hemp cloth is exceptionally rough, making it difficult to affix small labels and causing the handwriting to be blurry and difficult to recognize. To avoid these difficulties, it is requested that all senders henceforth sew a large piece of white cloth onto each of these packages, clearly stating the recipient's name and address for easy verification. This is to inform you." According to a person in charge of the section yesterday, any such packages submitted for mailing in the future will be refused.</p>
<p>Suspension of Mail to Certain Locations</p>
<p>A newspaper reporter learned from the Parcel Business Division of the Postal Administration yesterday that due to transportation difficulties, parcel post services have been suspended to the following locations: Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Guizhou, Zhenhai, Yin County, the southern part of Zhejiang Province, along the Zhe-Gan Railway, the southern part of Anhui Province, Jiangxi Province, Yongjia (Wenzhou), Rui'an, Gutoutou, Pingyang, Nanchang, and all areas south of it, Yichang, Changsha, Wanxian, Luzhou, Xufu, and all other locations. The postal administration has notified that it will temporarily suspend the acceptance of all large and small parcels, as well as individual parcels, to these locations. Mail services will resume as usual once shipping is restored to facilitate the flow of goods.</p>
<p>Occupied Areas</p>
<p>The areas where parcel post services are still operating as usual include: all locations along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, etc.; all ports along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, such as Hangzhou, Jiaxing, etc.; all areas north of the Yangtze River via Zhenjiang; along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway; Nantong, Qingdao, Dalian, Xiamen, Yantai, Tianjin, Beijing, Shandong, and other locations.

<p>— Water Foam</p>
<p>The committee members and staff of the Shanghai Psychological Hygiene Promotion Association are:</p>
<p>President: Dr. H.C. Westbrook (Professor, University of Shanghai)</p>
<p>Vice President: Huang Jiayin (Editor, West Wind)</p>
<p>Secretary: Dr. A.W. Sheriff (Professor, St. John's University)</p>
<p>Medical Advisor: Dr. F.G. Halpern (Professor of Neurology, St. John's University Medical School)</p>
<p>Dr. C.A. Cater (Doctor, Renji Hospital)</p>
<p>Committee Members: Ding Guangxun (Student Secretary, YMCA)</p>
<p>Li Zhu (Children's Welfare Section, Public Works Department)</p>
<p>Zeng Jingchen (Doctor, Hongqiao Sanatorium)</p>
<p>The Shanghai Psychological Hygiene Promotion Association is now cooperating with the World Red Cross to establish a neuropsychiatric hospital. To practice the spirit of serving society and from an academic research perspective, the hospital will use new and reasonable therapies not only to treat mental illness but also to improve the conditions of care and to pay attention to the mental health of patients after discharge.</p>
<p>The address of the Neuropsychiatric Hospital is 271 Yuyuan Road, located in a quiet environment. In the backyard, there is a green lawn, prepared as a sports ground for patients with mild mental illness. The courtyard is surrounded by evergreen trees, including parasol trees, banana trees, and flowers of various colors, red and blue, which add to the tranquil atmosphere of the hospital. The wards and dining rooms are all painted green. Patients who are nervous or manic can experience a calming and soothing effect from the harmonious and elegant colors. Furthermore, it feels comfortable and peaceful, as if one were at home rather than in a hospital.</p>
<p>The Neuropsychiatric Hospital is a three-story Western-style building. In front of the building on the ground floor is a corridor with reclining chairs for patients to rest. There is also a reception room, a dining room, a laboratory, a dispensing room, and the Children's Psychological Guidance Center established by the Shanghai Psychological Hygiene Promotion Association.</p>
<p>The windows in each room of the hospital are fitted with wire mesh to prevent unfortunate incidents involving patients. In the second-class wards, nurses are on duty day and night. In the first-class rooms, there are peepholes in the doors so that nurses can observe the patients' movements at all times without disturbing their peace. All equipment, such as rubber suits and tents, are the latest models, to prevent severe, delusional patients from becoming violent.</p>
<p>This hospital, which aims to improve the treatment of mentally ill patients, opened on June 9 of this year. However, it had already begun admitting patients in May. Currently, there are more than sixty patients in the entire hospital, with foreign patients accounting for one-third.</p>
<p>The director of the hospital is Dr. F.G. Halpern, Professor of Psychiatry at St. John's University Medical School in Shanghai, and also Chairman of the Specialist Talent Committee of the Shanghai Psychological Hygiene Promotion Association. Dr. Halpern is a well-known psychiatrist in Shanghai. The medical director of the hospital is Dr. Li Bangzheng.</p>
<p>In terms of treatment methods, in addition to medication, there is also psychotherapy, which includes methods such as hypnosis, psychoanalysis, and occupational therapy. The results of the implementation have been found to be very effective. Although the history of the hospital is short, three patients have already recovered their mental health and have been discharged happily.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Lawsuit Involving Good Friends Over a Thousand-Yuan Loan for Three Years; Seven Trials (or Twelve) Have Not Resolved It; The Court Advises Reconciliation to Avoid Spiritual and Material Losses <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Hu Yunfei, a shareholder of the Datong Machinery Factory on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, and Shen Hefang, a native of Ningbo, were originally good friends. In 1938, Hu borrowed 1,000 yuan from Shen, but failed to repay it on time. Fearing that Shen would sue him according to the law, Hu preemptively filed a lawsuit against Shen in the First Special District Court, claiming that Shen owed him a loan of 1,200 yuan. During the litigation, Shen presented the IOU and letters issued by Hu, proving that Hu had indeed borrowed money from him, and that Hu's accusation was</p>
<p>completely fabricated.</p>
<p>However, Hu claimed that the evidence presented by Shen was suspected of being forged. At the same time, he also filed a criminal lawsuit against Shen for forgery. Both the civil and criminal lawsuits were heard in three trials, and Shen won completely. The cases have been finalized. During the execution process, Shen believed that Hu not only failed to repay the loan but also repeatedly engaged in litigation, even maliciously filing civil and criminal lawsuits with false accusations. Feeling that it was difficult to calm his anger, he filed a lawsuit against Hu for false accusation. Although the first instance declared him not guilty, Shen still appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. Unexpectedly, Hu suddenly hired lawyer Yang Sicheng and filed a lawsuit against Shen Hefang in the criminal court of the First Special Court, accusing him of</p>
<p>forgery.</p>
<p>The facts he presented alleged that Shen had replaced the evidence presented in the case, causing the plaintiff to lose the case. Judge Liu Yukui opened a court hearing yesterday to try the case. The defendant, Shen Hefang, hired lawyers Shan Yuhua and Zhou Zhengli to appear in court. They found the plaintiff's accusation to be strange because the evidence was stored in the court's files. How could the defendant have the ability to secretly replace it? As for the plaintiff's character, the court should be well aware of it because the plaintiff was previously sentenced by the court in the Shanghai Paper Mill forgery case to</p>
<p>one year in prison</p>
<p>and is currently still on probation. However, Hu Yunfei accused lawyer Shan in court of using various shady tactics. Lawyer Shan immediately requested that the court record this statement in the minutes and said that the plaintiff himself had engaged in major shady activities during the civil lawsuit, and that his lawyer had evidence to prove it. Judge Liu immediately ordered them to stop arguing and declared that since both parties were originally good friends, they have been in litigation for three years over a small amount of over 1,000 yuan. The case has gone through</p>
<p>seven trials</p>
<p>and still cannot be resolved. In the future, even if there are twenty trials, it will be difficult to resolve. The mental suffering is not to mention, and the financial losses far exceed the original amount in dispute. Therefore, the court hopes that both parties can calm down and thoroughly reconcile from the root, so that the litigation can be stopped, the friendship can be restored, and the mental and material damage can be minimized. Shen Hefang expressed his willingness to accept the court's goodwill, but said that he did not want to be involved in litigation in the first place, and that it was the plaintiff who was fond of litigation. After the court reviewed the evidence, it announced that the case would be adjourned and that the plaintiff and defendant would be asked to try to reconcile outside the court.</p>

<p>At 7:30 AM yesterday (the 17th), four robbers broke into the home of economist Wang Zhiren (from Shandong) at No. 5 Hengmao Lane, Mintini Road. Three of them were armed with handguns. According to the victim, the thugs threatened him with weapons and robbed him of 28 gold bars hidden in his pillow, as well as a gold bracelet and four gold rings worn by his wife, worth a total of about 150,000 yuan. At the time, only the victim, his wife, and their two children were present. The thugs spoke with a northern accent. After entering the house, they went straight to the bed where the gold bars were hidden and robbed them without searching anywhere else. After obtaining the stolen goods, they fled without firing a shot. The victim reported the incident to the police an hour later.</p>

<p>Thugs Escaped in a Car According to the North China Daily News, at 9:00 PM last night (the 16th), Chinese constable No. 2263 was on duty at Yaoshui Lane on Xiaoshadu Road when four armed thugs suddenly arrived and robbed the constable of his handgun and police whistle. One of the thugs first tied up the Chinese constable's right hand, and another thug then snatched the handgun from his holster. They waited there for a while and then drove away in a car. At the time, the constable saw the license plate number of the car the thugs were in, but it is believed that the number was forged by the thugs to conceal their identity.</p>

<p>More than 700 workers in the Mechanical Department of the French Tram Company, due to demands for improved treatment, sent many representatives to visit the company's manager at 3:00 PM yesterday, stating the difficulties of their lives and requesting the company to increase wages to maintain their livelihoods. They did not get what they wanted at the time and left disgruntled. They sent representatives again at 5:30 PM for a second request, which was also not accepted.</p>
<p>As a result, the workers in the department were indignant and gathered at the company until 8:30 PM without dispersing. The company authorities, fearing an accident, reported to the Lujiawan General Police Station and dispatched two armored vehicles and all the detectives to the company to suppress the situation and persuade them with kind words.</p>
<p>They then dispersed. However, the ticket sellers and drivers in the Traffic Department were not affected. If the company does not have a concrete plan this morning, it is difficult to predict whether the Traffic Department's workers will be drawn into the vortex and whether there will be problems with the operation of the vehicles.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Guangdong Children's Education Institute Launches Sponsorship of Orphaned Children Movement; Sponsorship of One Child Costs 14 Yuan Per Month <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>(Shaoguan News) The Guangdong Children's Education Institute plans to launch a movement to sponsor orphaned children. People from home and abroad can decide the amount of sponsorship according to their financial ability, but the sponsorship of one child should be male in principle, the sponsorship of two children should be one male and one female in principle, the sponsorship of four children should be two males and two females in principle, and so on. The sponsorship of one orphaned child should be responsible for providing 14 yuan of national currency per month for their living expenses, and so on for more. The burden of living expenses will start from the date of sponsorship until the end of the war, when the children are sent back to their original relatives or can be self-sufficient. The institute has formulated a sponsorship form. After deciding on the number of sponsorships, two copies of the first type of form should be filled out according to the regulations, one copy for self-retention and one copy sent to the institute to select the sponsored children. Then, two copies of the second type of form should be filled out according to the regulations, one copy for retention by the institute and one copy sent to the sponsor as proof. It is generally stipulated that the sponsorship fee for half a year (the minimum limit is half a year) should be sent to the institute first, so that the sponsored orphaned children can have a close relationship with the sponsor and communicate frequently, and can be treated as children. If the sponsored orphaned child unfortunately dies or is taken back by their original parents, another sponsorship can be arranged. Also, after the children are sent back to their original parents, with the consent of the child's parents, the sponsor can directly establish a relationship with them. If, due to changes in economic circumstances, they cannot afford the living expenses of the orphaned children, other enthusiastic people must be found to sponsor them in their place, so as to avoid the sponsored children from experiencing a panic in their lives. If the sponsorship rights are transferred to others, the institute should be notified immediately. The institute plans to reward people from home and abroad who sponsor orphaned children. Those who sponsor 10 to 20 orphaned children will be given a banner by the president as a souvenir. Those who sponsor more than 20 children will be invited to have Chairman Li of the Provincial Government inscribe a horizontal plaque or banner as a souvenir. The names of all overseas Chinese sponsors and the number of sponsorships will be published in provincial newspapers and various publications of the institute.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Finance, Gold Market: Not Lacking New Buyers; Market Situation Turned Firm Again Yesterday <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold and black market conditions showed a steady trend, with selling pressure reduced and not lacking new buyers. Prices consistently hovered above $5,200. The morning opened at $5,230, which was already $30 better than the previous day. Then, securities firms and money changers jointly drove the price up to $5,280. At that time, it was heard that foreign exchange was also softening, but because securities and gold firms turned to selling, the price eventually fell to $5,200. After the low, money changers and gold firms rekindled their buying intentions, and the price stood firm at $5,260. The afternoon closed at $5,250, which was $50 higher than the previous day. In the afternoon, there was no market on Wednesday, and half-day trading was lackluster, estimated to be around 2,000 taels. Jewelry gold also saw changes. Customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Money Changers Made Many Purchases</p>
<p>Since the early morning, each bar (ten taels) initially followed the rise in foreign exchange, and the price rose accordingly, opening $30 higher. A bank sold 30 taels to a gold firm for $5,230. Later, because money changers and securities firms had a strong appetite, the price was raised another $50. A bank sold 10 taels to a money changer, rising to $5,280. Then, a certain securities firm and gold firm reversed course and sold, and many banks' long positions were closed. Buyers were scarce for a time, and the price was pushed back down $80. Banks sold a total of 20 taels to gold firms, retreating to $5,200. At this time, there were many buyers at the higher price, and the decline was blocked. Soon, a certain gold firm came back to scoop up, and a certain money changer's appetite suddenly improved, and the price rose again $60. A gold firm bought 20 taels from a bank for $5,260. The buying momentum subsided slightly at noon, and the price fell slightly. Banks sold 50 taels to gold firms, falling to $5,250. Yesterday's closing price was $50 higher than the previous day. With fluctuations of $80 in half a day, the selling price of spot gold from cash gold firms was more than $10 higher than that of bullion, and purchases were reduced by $30. Spot gold was more than $50 lower than listed gold, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Remained Unchanged</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael in silver shops was initially $540 by Dahang, and there was no change thereafter. Dahang still maintained the original price of $540. The price of Xinhang was similar to the previous price, and purchases were reduced by about $30.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Atmosphere of Peace Dissipated; Foreign Exchange Hedged <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed prices. The black market for British and American exchange rates was slightly tighter in the quiet, because the atmosphere of peace gradually faded, so sellers were not as crowded as the previous two days, and short positions had to be covered. The morning initially saw a gradual tightening trend, as speculators made some purchases. Later, because Hong Kong Electric and the Japanese Bank sold, the price hardened slightly. However, until the close, both Chinese banks and American banks had an appetite, although the amounts were extremely small, and the underlying trend was still tight. As a result of the close, British gold was 3 pence 90625, and the US exchange rate was 6 yuan 15625, each falling 03125 compared to the previous day's close. Futures were flat for British gold, and the same as spot for US exchange. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Japanese Bank Poured out Hong Kong Dollars</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London big bar was up 125 for the near term, and flat for the far term. New York silver prices were unchanged, London spot gold was stable, and the British exchange rate against the US dollar was unchanged.

The bank's opening spot selling price in the morning was 3 pence 90625 for British gold and 6 yuan 15625 for the US exchange rate, which was 03125 tighter for British gold and also tighter for US exchange compared to the previous evening's close. After opening, there was a lack of sellers, and the market tightened once, with the US exchange rate reaching 6 yuan 125 and British gold reaching 3 pence 875. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The silver equilibrium tax increased by 0.75%. Thereafter, the market was still quiet. It is estimated that the American Bank once sold US exchange for July at 6 yuan 125 to Chinese speculators. Later, Hong Kong Electric came to sell, and the Japanese Bank also sold, so the price hardened slightly. It is estimated that Hong Kong Electric and the Japanese Bank sold spot US exchange to foreign banks for 6 yuan 5625. The American Bank sold spot US exchange to Chinese banks from 6 yuan 15625 to 1875. Until noon, there were very few changes, and the price remained on the line between 6 yuan 15625 and 1875. Before the close, the American Bank bought US exchange for July from foreign banks for 6 yuan 1875. The noon price was 3 pence 90625 for British gold and 6 yuan 15625 for the US exchange rate. For August, British gold was 3 pence 875 and the US exchange rate was 6 yuan 09375, which was 03125 tighter for spot British gold and 03125 tighter for the US exchange compared to the previous evening's close.

<p>London, 16th Telegram: The London silver market saw the near term rise by 125 and the far term flat. There were buyers covering positions, and the supply was not large. The market was flat and there was little trading. The market remained stable after the close. New York Telegram: The US silver spot price was unchanged.

<p>Yesterday's exchange transfer bill discount rate suddenly rebounded. The morning discount rate reached 52 yuan per thousand yuan, and the discount rate also rose to 50 yuan. In the afternoon, it was still around 51 yuan, which was two yuan higher than the previous day. The interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association continued to fall by one cent to 18 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Rice Prices Rebounded by Two or Three Yuan Yesterday; Another 3,000 Tons of Imported Rice Arrived <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>After the rice market fell sharply again the day before, it immediately aroused the interest of buyers at noon. Yesterday morning, both buyers and sellers maintained the momentum of the previous day's noon market, and their intentions became firm. The buying momentum suddenly became strong. Not only was local sales smooth, but also inland village customers who had not dared to enter the market rashly had increased their demand after stopping for many days. At the same time, general buyers had been bored for a long time and suddenly found themselves in a good situation, feeling doubly excited. Shouts rose suddenly, and by nearly noon, prices had rebounded by a huge two or three yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. For example, No. 1 Chen Saigon opened at 56 yuan and a half, No. 2 at 53 yuan and a half, No. 1 Siam at 56 yuan, No. 2 at 53 yuan and a half, Fire Grind at 55 yuan and 7 cents, Small Grain at 54 yuan and a half, Tokyo Pointed Tip at 50 yuan and 3 cents, Broken Tip at 42 yuan and 8 cents, and then to 40 yuan, Rice Green at 445 yuan. The owner of the cargo loaded on the 20th of last month initially opened at 61 yuan and a half and immediately shouted 2 yuan higher without further agreement, while the cargo loaded on the 26th opened at 63 yuan and even rose from 63 yuan and 5 cents to 63 yuan and a half, which was 2 yuan and 9 cents higher than the previous day. The market was lively with grabbing and covering shorts, so spot transactions exceeded 10,000 bags. However, with the arrival of more stocks, actual sales were still slow. Yesterday's rebound was also a sign of a small rebound after a big fall, and there is no expectation of a sudden sharp rebound in the future market.</p>
<p>Another 3,000 tons of imported rice arrived yesterday, estimated to be more than 30,400 bags, shipped from Hong Kong by the Java Company's Cibadak vessel. The vessel arrived at the port at 9:00 AM yesterday and docked at the Pudong Blue Funnel Wharf for unloading. (Zu)</p>
<p>In this environment, general cargo owners also want to make a profit with glutinous rice, but it is difficult to achieve their wish because the price is already expensive. The price is neither rising nor falling, and only the market shape seems to be tighter. Jin Li Baiyuan is still only around 63 yuan, and Chang Dan Baiyuan is sold for 61 yuan. However, Hong Kong glutinous rice followed the rise of imported rice and opened at 645 yuan.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 bags of thick and thin japonica and other domestic rice arrived yesterday. It is rumored that outside the market, those who hold goods saw the rise in imported rice and tried to shout higher, but the price difference between domestic and imported rice was still too large. Buyers' appetite was normal, and the opening price failed to increase, which was still similar to the previous market.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Abundant Wheat Stocks in Hongkou; Difficult to Sell Unless at Low Prices; Chinese Factories Cannot Obtain It <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The flour market has no special characteristics, but the local sales of Chinese factory flour are gradually increasing. This is because the factory's supply has become widespread, and the price of rice has also fallen and risen slightly. Therefore, the flour shops in this street have a more greedy appetite, and the total number of packages directly approved by the Fufu factories is no less than 10,000. The factory price is still 16 yuan, and the retail price is about 3 cents higher per package. The old car brand warehouse receipt still requires a price of 17 yuan, but there is no proper delivery. Japanese factory flour competes with inland flour, and the market is loosening again. It is heard that Jinshan brand opened at 16 yuan and 3 cents, and Phoenix opened at 15 yuan and 1 cent in August, both of which are one or two cents lower. A total of 4,500 packages were traded.</p>
<p>The wheat market continues to be uneventful, because both Japanese and Chinese factories do not make large purchases. The new arrivals in Hongkou are accumulating, and they are suppressed by Japanese factories, which only purchase at low prices, so the transactions are very quiet. Chinese factories have difficulty purchasing and have to pay attention to imported wheat. It is heard that Fufeng Factory ordered a ship of Australian wheat and intends to continue to order. It is currently in telecommunications negotiations.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Miscellaneous Grains: Minor Transactions; Prices Mostly Downstream <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The market conditions for miscellaneous grains have been poor, and people have little interest, resulting in minor transactions and prices mostly downstream. Yesterday, a total of 500 bags of Anqing soybeans were traded at a price of 28 yuan and 2 cents to 28 yuan. 200 bags of Qingdao soybeans were traded at a price of 29 yuan. 100 bags of Pudong broad beans were traded at a price of 27 yuan and 7 cents. 50 bags of Jiading white-skinned broad beans were traded at a price of 22 yuan. 400 bags of Wuhu small-grain white-skinned broad beans were traded at a price of 18 yuan and 3 cents to 18 yuan. 150 bags of Beigang green-skinned broad beans were traded at a price of 21 yuan and 7 cents to 21 yuan. 150 bags of Chongming green-skinned broad beans were traded at a price of 20 yuan to 19 yuan and 5 cents. More than 100 bags of Pudong green-skinned broad beans were traded at a price of 20 yuan and 2 cents and 5 cents, and more than 100 bags of Wuhu corn were traded at a price of 21 yuan and 5 cents. The above-mentioned goods, except for Chongming broad beans, which were handled by Guangdong merchants, were all sold in this street.</p>
<p>There are 1,300 bags of beans going to Hong Kong today. 1,450 cans of raw oil came from Qingdao yesterday.</p>

<p>Yesterday's black market conditions for unified public bonds were erratic, and the trend was complex and abnormal. When it opened in the morning, the rumored peace rumors were corrected in the newspaper, so everyone fled, and speculators took the opportunity to monopolize, leaning left and right, so the market was rising and falling suddenly, with a downward trend. By the afternoon, the market situation suddenly returned to normal. A powerful long family, although feeling that the rumors could not be followed by strong confirmation, had the delusion that there was no trace of evidence, and because the ninth phase was about to pay interest, it made buyers excited, so many rushed to absorb, so there was a phenomenon of selling to buy on the market, and the market immediately rose, especially Bingjia. As a result, the overall trend was slightly soft. It is estimated that Wuxiao fell 25 cents, Bingyi fell by about one cent, and Dingjia was unchanged. The transaction was even more prosperous, reaching a scale of 1.78 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's stock market saw 20 shares of China Bank traded at a price of 12 yuan per share.</p>
<p>The stock market news of various industries is still uncertain, but the trend is still firm. Because there are many sellers when the price rises, it is not easy to raise the market price very high. The transaction volume is less than in the previous few days, and there are more people interested in rubber stocks.</p>
<p>London, 16th (Tuesday) Telegram: Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debts are generally flat. Only the Anglo-German continued loan British bond notes fell by 5 pounds, priced at 35 pounds, and the rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Anglo-German Continued (British)</p>
<p>35.00 Down 5.00</p>
<p>London, 16th (Tuesday) Telegram: Today's listed prices of Far East British companies' stocks saw a slight rebound in bank stocks. Jardine Matheson Bank shares rose by 2 shillings and 6 pence, priced at 6 pounds. HSBC Bank shares rose by 2 pounds each, with British-registered shares at 65 pounds and Hong Kong-registered shares at 67 pounds. Golak Limerick Pound rubber shares alone fell by 7 and a half pence, priced at 14 shillings and 4 and a half pence, and the rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Yarn and Cotton: Longs Attempt to Rebound Cotton Yarn Prices; Double Horse Yarn Up 26 Yuan from Previous Day <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market fell miserably the day before, but today it has improved slightly. This is because the decline the day before was too severe, and the peace rumors are still unsubstantiated, so people are calm, and longs are stable. At the same time, the gold market has rebounded again, so speculators have slightly purchased a few packages to maintain the market. However, the sales of existing yarn are very scarce, and the changes in the future are difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Existing yarn opened this morning. Because the atmosphere of war and peace dissipated, people turned their minds, and new sellers were scarcer. The long side slightly absorbed a few packages. The opening price of 20s Double Horse was 920 yuan, falling to 905 yuan, but actual transactions were still rare. However, the market was tight because the selling sentiment was not timid. The scalpers sold the chips at the opening, and after 11:00 AM, the foreign exchange had no major changes, so they made up for their positions, and the market gradually rose, forming an inverse proportion to the previous day. The highest price at the close was 941 yuan. The statistics of transactions in half a day totaled 1,360 packages. The price of 20s Double Horse rose by 26 yuan. A total of 600 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today. The amount purchased by each gang is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Same Industry 1,250 Inland 10</p>
<p>Hong Kong 100 Total 1,360</p>
<h3 id="e84">Indian Cotton Fixed Prices Increased; Chinese Factories Move to Handle Spot Cotton <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Spot cotton transactions are slightly more active because Indian cotton fixed prices have increased compared to before, so people are calm, and Chinese factories have slightly higher demand. The spot cotton situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Da Zhong Ji 213.00 New Yu Jin 100 Pieces</p>
<p>Also 213.00 Also 500 Packages</p>
<p>Special Tonghua 183.00 Also 500 Packages</p>
<p>Ningbo Hua 160.00 Chongxin Jin 8,000 Dan</p>
<p>In addition, the foreign cotton market price, the New York cotton market, initially fell slightly due to speculators selling, and then rebounded due to poor weather in the cotton area and public purchases. As a result, the closing price, in addition to the recent continued fall of 14 pounds sound, the far term rose by 78 pounds sound. The Indian market is firm, and yesterday, including the forecast, it rose by more than two rupees.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, yarn prices rebounded yesterday, and people's minds improved. Factories are quite willing to purchase, but due to the high prices demanded by the industry, there were no transactions. But according to today's situation, the foundation of cotton is very good.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Silk and Tea: Shrimp Eye Pearl Tea Sold Slightly <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The tea market in foreign firms yesterday was still flat. Although the German firms were still active in coarse black tea, the stocks were lacking, and the supply could not meet the demand. The green tea stocks, including raw tea, were no less than 8,000 bundles, and there were also 3,000 boxes of boxed tea. Because of the limited shipping routes for French firms, the market was difficult to improve. The current market is only selling a small amount of colorless shrimp eye pearl tea of the Ping Shui type by American firms. The entire city purchased more than 80 boxes of pearl tea from Tongfu Jinlong and other firms, with a selling price of 250 yuan to 290 yuan, which was more than 10 yuan lower than before.</p>
<p>Also, 600 pieces of tea were shipped to Tianjin today.</p>
<h3 id="e86">North-South Goods: Lychees Arrived Late; Xin Hao Lychees Cannot Be Shipped; Haikou Lychee Sources Also Blocked <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>According to a letter from a customer, the ten types of lychees produced in Zhangzhou, such as Lanting, Wuye, and Zaohong, have indeed entered the market, but the sailing ship transportation between Zhangzhou and Gulangyu has recently been stagnant, so they cannot be shipped. They must wait for the resumption of shipping before they can be loaded, so the arrival date in Shanghai is yet to be determined.</p>
<p>A total of more than 3,000 boxes of new Haikou lychees have arrived. Originally, sales were not very smooth, but the other day, there was news that the Zhejiang-Fujian Haikou was blocked, so the Yong Ou route was completely blocked. To avoid the accumulation of inventory, the firm has telegraphed the cargo owner to stop loading.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Sugar Market: Crude White Sugar Market Firm Later <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The sugar market was weak at first and then firm yesterday, resulting in a slight increase. The association's plan, the spot price of 24 crude white foreign warehouse goods, was initially 66 yuan and 3 cents, and later rose to 66 yuan and 6 cents, up by one cent, and the transshipment goods were stronger, with the first price once reaching 53 yuan, and later 52 yuan and 7 cents to 5 cents, which was half a yuan better than before. Taiche white sugar also initially fell and then rose, with the B Mark at 75 yuan and 6 cents to 8 cents, and then still at 76 yuan, with no increase or decrease. Dutch red sugar was 58 yuan, up 3 cents, and the local warehouse was 58 yuan and a half. A Guangdong merchant sold dozens of packages of Haikou foreign sugar, priced at 68 yuan and 2 cents, which was higher than before.</p>
<p>Also, 1,600 tons of sugar came from Holland yesterday.</p>

<p>Since the uniform factory price for coal balls was set the other day, the business has been sluggish due to the hot weather, and the exchange rate has loosened, reducing costs. The day before yesterday, the industry firms reduced the price by another 6 yuan, so the price of Yitai Xing, Nanyang, and Guohua coal balls is 132 yuan per ton by car and 134 yuan delivered, and the retail price per load is 7 yuan and 20 cents.</p>

<p>Zhaozhi goods were once reduced by four or five yuan due to poor sales, but the source has long since stopped. The inventory in the market is gradually decreasing except for retail sales, and the scheduled goods are also about to be delivered, so the trend has tightened again, and the current price of scheduled goods has been increased by five yuan.</p>

<p>Encouraging Burial (2)</p>
<p>According to ancient etiquette, scholars and commoners should be buried within a month of death. Before the burial, they should not change their clothes, eat porridge, live in a thatched hut, and mourn the fact that their loved ones have not yet been returned to the earth. According to the laws and regulations of the Qing Dynasty, anyone with a family in mourning who is confused by feng shui or delays the burial of the coffin at home for years under false pretenses shall be punished with eighty strokes of the cane. In addition, according to the regulations of the 37th year of Qianlong, if the coffin has not been buried, one year shall be the limit. In addition to those who have the ability and land to be buried, they shall be urged to bury them according to etiquette. Or if they cannot obtain land for a time, they shall be allowed to rent land outside the city for temporary placement and still be ordered to find land for burial as soon as possible, without causing long-term placement in shallow soil. Those who have coffins that have been stored at home for many years shall be punished according to the law. It can be seen that overdue burial is prohibited by law. If one borrows the remains of one's ancestors to predict the success of one's descendants, is it that geography has authority, but heaven has no authority? And also think about the hard work of the ancestors in starting and building the family. Now that the decaying bones have been cold, obtaining a piece of land is the best. If the dead have knowledge, they will count their sins and strip their souls. How can they make us prosperous in descendants and wealth, and bless our achievements? I wish those in the world who delay burial to quickly seek burial in the soil for peace. The good or bad luck depends on heaven. In short: burial is to store bones, and the burial site does not have to be beautiful; burial is to appease the soul, and the burial objects do not have to be abundant. Whether it is buried after seven days, or after a hundred days, or after a year, do not leave the coffin for a long time, do not delay in choosing a site, so that parents can get a day of peace sooner, which is to leave a day of blessing for the children.</p>

<h3 id="e92">The Relationship Between Jesus and Humanity <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>"When Jesus saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd." This is recorded in Matthew 9:36 of the Christian New Testament. From these words, we know that Jesus' compassion for the world was because people were "harassed," "helpless," and "like sheep without a shepherd." These are indeed three common ailments of humanity, past and present. Let us discuss them separately:</p>
<p>(1) The accurate interpretation of the original text of the words "harassed" is: "Wandering aimlessly, resulting in fatigue and exhaustion." If a person spends his life wandering around like strolling on the street, through bustling main roads and quiet back alleys, without any purpose, wasting his life, it is an extremely sad thing. At that time, Jesus saw that most people were suffering from such a problem, constantly changing their minds and having no definite purpose, leaving them exhausted and even developing a pessimistic attitude towards life, devoid of any joy. It was truly pitiful.</p>
<p>(2) The original meaning of the words "helpless" is: scattering in all directions. This is also a major ailment of humanity. People cannot connect with each other, cannot express sympathy, and cannot cooperate. They go their separate ways and have different dreams while sharing the same bed. Some say, "Because people have different lives and different thoughts, it is difficult to unite as one." But the Christian Bible tells us that humans are born of the same root (Acts 17:26) and should be connected to each other, as close as siblings. If we can do this, then weapons of war can be turned into instruments of peace.</p>
<p>(3) "Like sheep without a shepherd" refers to Jesus' compassion for the people of that time, who lacked a proper leader and were led by the blind. This was the case in Jesus' time, and is it not the same now? Although all countries have their leaders, such as Hitler in Germany, Churchill in England, Roosevelt in the United States, and Mussolini in Italy, these people have all made contributions to their own countries. But who is worthy to be the leader of the world? Napoleon of France could be considered a "hero of the age," but even he sighed in admiration of Jesus' greatness. Jesus is indeed the true leader of humanity, and only he can save us from hardship and wandering.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Between Two Generations <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>The gap between parents and children, the two generations, is at most only twenty-odd years. In the past, the progress of the times was like an old ox pulling a broken cart, and twenty-odd years didn't amount to much. But today, the rapid advances in science and thought have made these twenty-odd years an insurmountable chasm, separating parents and children and creating two opposing centuries of people.</p>
<p>Thus, serious conflicts arise between the two generations. Parents say their children are unfilial and don't understand the rules. Children complain that their parents are out of touch and have outdated ideas. Fierce, invisible struggles occur within the family. Weak children endure life under the pressure of their parents' economic power, suppressing their anger. Stubborn children rise up to resist, and when there is no other option, a family tragedy unfolds.</p>
<p>Can this conflict between the new and the old, this tragedy of family breakdown, be avoided? Is there an end to the conflict and struggle between father and son, mother and daughter?</p>
<p>The clash of new and old ideas is a necessary phenomenon in the process of social evolution. The times are always moving forward, and promising young people will naturally follow the trend of the times. If parents can keep up with the thinking of the times and understand the psychology of their children, then this tragedy of going against the current can be reduced or eliminated.</p>
<h3 id="e94">I Bless My Younger Brother <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Wangchuan</p>
<p>I have a younger brother, a brother I am proud to show to anyone. I myself believe that if I lost this younger brother, I would be lost forever. I can't be sure what should be done and what shouldn't. My brother often watches over me, instructs me, and even scolds me. I have never resisted or disobeyed his corrections and punishments, because what he says is often right, and it doesn't sound like something a child would say. I have no reason not to listen to him. As a result, my father often says I'm useless, and I myself feel useless.</p>
<p>My brother is thirteen years old this year, and he has a heart that seeks truth and light. He has asked me several times, "Why don't you go to the Southwest?" I always reply, "My body is too weak, I'll definitely get sick and die if I go." Then he makes a face at me.</p>
<p>Once, my fourth aunt came to Shanghai from my hometown, and my mother wanted me to accompany her to see a movie. I happily put on my clothes. Just as I was about to go downstairs, my brother came back from school and asked me where I was going. My mother replied that we were going to see a movie and told him to come along too. My brother glanced at me, put his schoolbag on the desk, looked at the opposite wall, and said to me in a serious voice, "Brother, have you forgotten our agreement?"</p>
<p>Indeed, I remembered that there was such a clause in our nine-article agreement: "From the date of this agreement until the victory of the war of resistance, we shall not watch movies or dramas, except for those of great significance." So I put down my hat, leaned back in my chair, lowered my head, and repented deeply. My mother was still urging me to hurry up in the next room, but I didn't answer.</p>
<p>My brother walked up to me and said softly, "Brother, I'm sorry, I didn't know you were accompanying my aunt. Don't you remember that the agreement says except for plays with significance?" I burst into tears, I hugged him tightly, I told him that I really had no intention of seeing a movie with significance. This made me even more ashamed and remorseful. My brother whispered in my ear, "Just don't go." I really felt that this was too easy on me, too indulgent of me.</p>
<p>Yesterday was my brother's birthday, and my aunt gave him a Parker fountain pen. My brother was very happy to receive it. He asked my mother for a piece of velvet cloth and carefully wiped it over and over. I watched coldly from the side, thinking to myself, today I should say, "This pen must be foreign!" This immediately took effect, and the smile on his face disappeared. He stared blankly at the pen, and I knew that this had hurt his heart. I shouldn't have harbored a retaliatory intention to hurt him. I felt so small, I regretted that I had said it.</p>
<p>My brother handed the pen to my mother and said, "Please keep it for me until I grow up."</p>
<p>In short, my younger brother is so respectable and lovable. He invisibly gives me a lot of courage and comfort, showing me a bright future. Many relatives and friends say that my brother doesn't seem like a child, and when I hear that, I secretly bless him all the time.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Not Afraid of Setbacks <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Ou Li</p>
<p>The reason why a person becomes a great man is often not without reason.</p>
<p>It is said that the Irish are most unafraid of setbacks and failures, and the Irish Prime Minister Éamon de Valera is the best example.</p>
<p>One day in 1923, de Valera was giving a political speech in Ennis when he was suddenly arrested and imprisoned for a year.</p>
<p>A year later, when he was released from prison, he immediately went back to Ennis to continue the speech he had not finished. He said, "When I was interrupted and stopped speaking, I was just saying..."</p>
<p>Look, look at this stubborn spirit of not being afraid of setbacks!</p>
<h3 id="e96">Revival of the Church <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Many people say that to revive a city, you must abolish gambling dens and brothels; but God only asks his people to humble themselves, pray, seek his face, and turn away from their wicked ways, and he will forgive their sins and heal their land.</p>
<p>To revive China, there are three important things:</p>
<p>(1) Prayer The Bible says, "If you knock, the door will be opened to you; if you ask, you will be given; you do not receive, because you do not ask." Once, Dr. Scharpe, of the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in the United States, was leading a revival meeting in a certain place when a woman said to him, "Doctor, this revival meeting will surely have a great revival." Dr. Scharpe asked her, "How do you know that this time there will be a great revival?" She said, "My family needs revival; my husband is an alcoholic, my son is weak in faith, our church and this place need revival; I believe this revival meeting will have good results, because the people here have prayed a lot for this meeting before it started." Later, 198 people turned to Christ and dedicated themselves to working for the Lord. Dr. Scharpe praised this woman's prayer every time he mentioned the success of this revival meeting.</p>
<p>(2) A life of dedication Once, I met a young man on the bus and asked him, "Are you a Christian?" He said, "I am not a Christian, but I am a Presbyterian." Another time, I met another young man on the train, and I asked him, "Are you a Christian?" He said, "No, I am a Methodist." This shows that many church members are not true Christians. If the church needs revival, there must be true Christians. A year ago, I met a sister who was a nurse and had lived a life of sin. Soon after, she believed in Jesus and confessed Jesus in front of everyone. Last summer, she resolved to travel all over the world to become a fisher of men. She had no strength before, but now she has strength, because she is living a life of dedication.</p>
<p>(3) Earnestness The Lord Jesus wept when he saw Jerusalem, because the people of that city did not believe in him. Today, there are thousands and millions of people in Shanghai who have no hope and live in sin. What do you feel? Were we born into the world only for food and clothing? If we forget to save people's souls for the sake of food and clothing, then that is not right.</p>
<p>Young brothers and sisters, the harvest is ripe. Every day, how many lost people are sinking into hell because we do not care about their souls. We must hurry to take on the responsibility of saving people. For details, please write to Post Office Box 1581.</p>
<p>Hawthorne's Detective Cases</p>
<h3 id="e97">The Fate of the Dance Queen <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Three: Conflicting Information</p>
<p>"Yes, he is the son of Master Li and also the cousin of Miss Wang. He came from Suzhou for lunch on the seventeenth the day before yesterday, stayed overnight, and went back early yesterday morning. Master Li personally took him to the train."</p>
<p>Hawthorne paused and nodded. "Okay, tell me, what happened when Miss Wang and her cousin were talking here?"</p>
<p>Old Mao said, "That man surnamed Zhao suddenly came. Miss Wang saw him from the window and quickly left this reception room to prevent Zhao Boxiong from entering. Then she closed the front door and pulled the curtains here, clearly not letting Zhao see anything. Zhao, finding this boring, stood at the door for a while before walking away with a sullen face."</p>
<p>I thought to myself, "Alas! Three weren't enough, and now another one is added! This woman's charming magic during her lifetime is truly terrifying!"</p>
<p>The room was silent for only a second or two before Old Mao automatically opened his mouth again.</p>
<p>"Sir, don't misunderstand. No matter what, that man surnamed Zhao would never have killed Miss Wang. It must have been Yu Gantang..."</p>
<p>Hawthorne jumped up for the second time, and this time his movements were even faster than before. He ran to the door and, with lightning-like speed, pulled it open with one hand. Standing stiffly outside the door was the maid, Jinmei.</p>
<p>Hawthorne said loudly, "Jinmei, what are you doing?"</p>
<p>Jinmei's face was pale, and her lips were trembling slightly. Her previous calm demeanor had completely disappeared.</p>
<p>She said stammeringly, "I...I came to report..."</p>
<p>"Report what?"</p>
<p>"I know the murderer must be Zhao Boxiong, definitely not Young Master Yu."</p>
<p>"How do you know?"</p>
<p>"Because Miss Wang lost so many jewelry, it must be... someone wanted her money. This must be murder for money. Young Master Yu is rich, how could he do such a thing...?"</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou had also followed to the door, roaring at her. "Who asked you to express your opinion? You dared to eavesdrop! Go back upstairs!" (48)</p>

<p>— Lei Xing</p>
<p>Stained with blood, years and events weave together like stagnant history.</p>
<p>Breathing the suffocating air of this era, we yearn for a bright and sunny tomorrow. Seeing through the sword light and bloodshed before us, we look forward to the victorious Far East.</p>
<p>Opening the pages of the book, we become braver: history will never deceive.</p>
<p>No one can erase history, and the death light sought by executioners cannot destroy the existence of iron. The demons of darkness will eventually vanish in the dawn of the morning light. For the former, this is truly an irresolvable sorrow.</p>
<p>History has arranged a "Waterloo" for every "Napoleon," and reality will not neglect it either.</p>
<p>The bloody history and bloody reality have sentenced the end of hegemony. Therefore, people struggling in suffering always have great courage and will never slacken—belief and ideals form a driving whip.</p>

<p>The German people's active spirit of seeking knowledge is worthy of our emulation.</p>
<p>In the Saar region, the German front line currently has a mobile bookstore, which travels between various military camps and posts along the Siegfried Line.</p>
<p>When the European War began, libraries were established at troop locations; the books in the libraries were donated by the public and bookstores. However, soldiers still needed fresh spiritual food, so the mobile bookstore was set up.</p>
<p>The store is run by the German Book Industry General Office, which entrusts the Labor Front to organize it, and uses public buses as mobile shops. Bookshelves are set up next to the bus, and small tables are placed in the middle for soldiers to read books and newspapers. The store has about 1,500 books and several copies of the day's newspapers. If there are books that the store does not have, soldiers can pre-order and ask them to bring them next time.</p>
<p>The mobile bookstore employs one driver and two administrators, all of whom are provided with meals by the military kitchen.</p>

<p>— Fan Xuehui</p>
<p>Children have children's manuals, playwrights have drama manuals, and artists have art manuals.</p>
<p>People who like to read have their own manual. They write down sentences that they cannot remember in it, and when they need to quote them, they can retrieve them immediately.</p>
<p>I think it is also possible to compile a manual for reading newspapers, collecting terms such as politics, economics, military affairs, history, and geography, as well as various revelations, into one volume. However, the compiler must put in a lot of effort and not just make it a nominal thing, then I think many people will need this newspaper reading manual.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Starting from Competing Stages <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Mei</p>
<p>Competing stages don't seem to be very common in the theater world, but recently, because filmmakers are competing to film so-called folk tales, competing stages have become a special phenomenon in the isolated island film scene today.</p>
<p>In the past, when spring stage plays were performed in rural villages, in order to invite troupes and attract audiences for various reasons, occasionally wonderful dramas with competing stages were also performed. The sponsoring village would use all its social skills to create a luxurious setting, and the theater troupes would also do their best to attract the audience. Thus, the audience who came from the cities and towns to listen to the plays were blessed with a feast for the eyes, ears, and mouth. I remember when I was a child, two neighboring villages, A and B, caused a fight because of competing stages. As a result, the government issued a notice prohibiting it. Later, when the two villages performed spring stage plays, they had to jointly hire a theater troupe to perform at the center of the two villages. At that time, the most famous Jianghu troupe charged only fifty or sixty yuan for a play from morning to night, but this was something that ordinary rural villages did not dare to consider. Since then, because the two villages joined forces, they gradually invited these famous troupes. At that time, the civil and military Xusheng Xiao Longsheng's "War of Wancheng," Xiao Beijing's "Stealing the Zongjuan Scroll," the white-bearded old Sheng Huang'er's "Sweeping Pine Under the Book," and the Huadan Haitanghong's "Yin and Yang River" are still popular today, and they are considered an unexpected harvest from competing stages.</p>
<p>Here, I also remember the collaboration between Tan Xinpei and Wang Xiaonong in "Zhu Lian Zhai." Tan and Wang were both top-notch famous actors in the capital at that time, and their artistic achievements each had their own unique aspects. However, neither of them was willing to humble themselves. In 1915, for some unknown reason, they actually collaborated to perform "Zhu Lian Zhai" in the Dong'an Market at that time. Tan played Li Keyong, and Wang played Cheng Jingsi. The two men's skills were equal, and each showed their strengths. The beauty was difficult to compare, and the audience had a feeling that "this song should only be found in heaven." Although this was not a competing stage, Tan and Wang's different performance styles, once they collaborated, taking the best of each other and covering up their own shortcomings, a perfect combination, wasn't it a new contribution to the theater world?</p>
<p>Therefore, some people believe that today's competing stages in the isolated island film industry can curb crude and shoddy production. There is naturally some truth to this, but if the filmmakers can eliminate their unwillingness to give in to each other and instead seek common cooperation, then it may not be difficult to add a special color to today's isolated island film scene!</p>

<p>When Edward G. Robinson was filming "All Through the Night," he specially ordered his servants to bring his leather sofa from home, ready to lie down and rest. However, he was a step late, and the great director Tay Garnett had already sat down before him. He had no choice but to entertain the guests and couldn't force him to sit down. This armchair was really too comfortable. After Tay Garnett, other actors came to sit, and he had to let them sit with a smile. He stood until his legs were tired and his waist was sore, and he couldn't stop calling out "Injustice." When he got home, he had someone carry it home.</p>
<p>Marlene Dietrich, who has returned to the screen, is the most fond of having fun. Ever since she used a kaleidoscope to have fun with James Stewart while filming "Destry Rides Again," everyone smiles and avoids her when they see her coming. One day, Marlene ran into Miguel Lona on the road and stopped him, saying, "Miguel, I have a puppy that looks just like you, so I named it Miguel." Miguel pondered for a while and said seriously to her, "Um! Miss, thank you for your kindness. At the moment, I have nothing to say. I will discuss it with my lawyer and then talk about it." After he finished speaking, he walked away by himself, which made Marlene very angry.</p>
<p>Dorothy Lamour and Johnny Weissmuller are both foreigners with long hair in the film city. Now, there is one less comrade, because Fox Company wants to invite Dorothy Lamour to star in "Dance and the Devil," and at the same time, there is a condition that she has to cut her hair short. Dorothy Lamour happily set off firecrackers.</p>
<p>The servants of Hollywood stars are not used by you, but you listen to their orders. Take the great director Wesley Ruggles' black cook Tom as an example. One morning, when Wesley was having breakfast, he received Tom's letter of resignation, which read: "Dinner must not be late, no later than seven o'clock. Do not talk to Clark Gable, go visit Joe Louis. If you keep your promise, he will not break his promise. If you return in the middle of the night, come and ask me for food. I am already in dreamland, please be careful."</p>

<p>— Lingzi</p>
<p>Not long ago, Xinhua Film Company held a public examination to cultivate newcomers. As a result, seven women were admitted, and Shangguan Yunzhu was one of them.</p>
<p>Shangguan Yunzhu is not her real name. Her name is Wei Yajun. Because the executives of Xinhua felt that the actor's name was related to their own hopes, they changed her name to her current name.</p>
<p>In the past, she was an employee of He Zuoming's He's Photography Studio. Because of her personality inclination towards drama, she often engaged in drama activities in her spare time. Not long ago, the Huaguang and Yixing drama troupes successively performed "The Beginning of Man" and "Women's Apartment," and she played the female lead in both plays. Her Mandarin acting skills are quite proficient.</p>
<p>Among the ten folk films of Xinhua, she was originally assigned to play the role of Wang Laohu's sister in "Wang Laohu Grabbing a Bride," and she had already filmed two shots. However, later, Xinhua authorities felt that newcomers should not be rushed to perform during the training period, lest the audience have a superficial impression. Therefore, they specially asked Tong Yuejuan to replace her role, giving her more time to cultivate herself.</p>
<p>Among the newcomers admitted by Xinhua this time, in addition to the seven women, there are also seventeen men, who are currently in training. It is expected that under Xinhua's promotion, they will soon shine brightly on the silver screen.</p>
