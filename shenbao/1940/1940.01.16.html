<h3 id="c14">日本新內閣與美日關係 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>關於日本阿部內閣的傾覆，本報昨日已經約略評述。奉命組織繼任內閣的米內光政，經多方張羅後，已將全體閣員的人選確定。米內是海軍大將，是海軍軍閥中之佼佼者，却也比較溫厚穩健。新外務大臣爲有田八郎，倘若日本軍閥不是祇許他做留聲機，祗要他做傳話人，他當能遵循國際外交的一般法度；比之阿部最初的自兼外相，乃至嗣後的邀的野村大將爲外相，他們雖非留聲機或傳話人，但以外交舞臺而論，究竟類於「票友」「反串」。我們若以國際的水準來說：有田不是氣魄宏偉的外交家，究竟不失爲出色當行的外交官。日本有無外交家？尤其在此軍閥主政，侵略失敗而不能悔禍的時代，能否產生外交家？這是另一問題，不必論；但外交官儘出色當行，終是無濟於事。有田這次登臺第一慕，大約無法博得一聲喝采吧！不是有田不夠，以日本的根本風雨飄搖，更復深入歧途，雖得外交官脣焦舌敝，力竭聲嘶，豈能裨補萬一。</p>
<p>第一慕，距今十日，美日商約到本月廿六失效了。在美國方面，則朝野態度堅强：在日本方面，雖新內閣組織完成的時候自將宣示態度，但輿論界却表現了種種强硬論調。例如大阪每日新聞表示如「東亞新秩序」與對美商約不可得兼，則寗願放棄後者；軍部喉舌的都新聞則預測未來新內閣應對美採取更堅決態度並造成蘇日間更友好的空氣。這些表示，與其認爲是某一部分人的政治主張，其實無寗說是對外恫嚇的一種姿態。因爲日本之小能以蘇代美，原是極明顯的事實，而且如果沒有美國軍火器材的供給、所謂「東亞新秩序」的建立也將成爲泡影。即以日本政局方面而言，內閣雖已更迭了，今後除非元老重臣與財閥竟完全失掉控制力量，或軍部極右翼强制了米內有田行事，也許眞曾走上親蘇反美之路；不然，則此後的外交不是無所謂政策，祇是由外交官竭力左右肆應；至多更作局部讓步，企圖緩和國外的反感而已。</p>
<p>縱觀美國邇來對日輿情，實較前益趨激昂，即以政府當局與畢德門等人而言，態度縱略爲持重，然其根本出發點實與最激烈的制日論者同出於正義人道與維護九國公的的精神，絕非僅斤於在華權益的尊重和保持。日方的讓步藉令做到最大限度，也不過使美國的日本宣傳工作人員以及美國一部分祗顧近利的人們，獲得了些藉口新資料；旣不足以緩和美國一般的對日情緒，更不足以動搖美國安定遠東局勢的決心，削减美國旣定的政策。所以目前的中心問題，並非日本的輿論姿態如何，外交官的手腕如何，而是如何能使美國總統羅斯福氏及其他朝野人士的遠大抱貢獲得貫澈。</p>
<p>當然，美國人士之間，見解亦自有相當的參差；例如紐約時報在評論史汀生最近主張的論文中，提出了其他各國的對日態度問題；暗示其主張美國亦有徘徊瞻顧的餘地。我們不反對美國休休有容，使日本有保持其光榮而自行修正，自行轉變，自動放棄其侵略政策的機會；但自去年七月廿六到現在，日本並未善自利用這半年的機會。故紐約時報所論，我們以爲在運用上不妨留餘地，但亦必其有限度；而在道義上與利害上，則必認識其並無通融餘地。蓋自「九一八」事變以來的八九年當中，在遠東確曾有過許多遏絕侵略消泯危機的機會，只是由於列强的三數執政者因循苟且，步驟凌亂，寡斷優柔，養癰貽忠，致使星星之火一發至不可收拾，威脅着全世界的安髯，間接也促進了歐陸風雲的爆發。而今英法蘇聯諸國，業已先後捲入戰爭漩渦，此時當然不復能侈談協調對日；然而不管諸國在其他方面利害關係怎樣，若單以遠東而論，則其所遭受日方的威脅與迫害，實屬各國始終毫無二致。更何况日閥南進北進雙方的基本軍事佈置完成之日，隨時均可從事運用。列强即使不放棄其以鄰爲沼的餌日政策，充其量僅足苟安一時，另一方面却正替日閥做了藉以威脅其他國家的工具，無論對人對已均屬有百害而無一利。歷數與遠東有關的各個列强，在今日沒有一國與日本具有共同利害關係，也沒有一國利於日本征服中國。這在道義上，利害上，所絕對沒有第二結論的。各國而不能同此結論，則絕不足以保障其在遠束的重大權益，也不足以解除在遠東所遭受的嚴重危脅。今日的美國是未牽入戰爭的最大强國，也是世界正義與秩序的最有力保衛者，其外交政策的　用，儘可獨往獨來，原無待於對其他各國作諮詢，而各國的遠束政策亦必因美國態度的堅强而趨於穩定。日本歷來旣小能了解美國的意響與決心，遂至一再自誤；到了現在，能相當了解美國了，但如平沼阿部兩時代的想利用德蘇，以及如最近每日新聞與都新聞的虛聲恐嚇，暴露了日本還未了解各國與美國的對遠東利害一致。米內有田登台，其勢不能大有作爲；但能糾正其國內對於國際認識的不足，亦即是對於國家的貢獻了。米內有田能否作此貢獻，在美日商約失效之際，可以略見端倪。</p>

<p>在滬庽居酷嗜戲劇</p>
<p>兪葉封、杭州人、年六十一歲、民初曾充嘉興水上緝私統領嗣即卸任、來滬作寓公、愛聆皮簧、以故南北名角、均喜與之交游、有時撰述游藝文字、以資消造、因其留滬多年、故各界稔者頗多、近年復股設霖記木行於愛多亞路、此外並任長城唱片公司經理、其友王大章、現充更新舞臺經理、因兪嗜好平劇、且更新聘邀平津名角得兪之力頗多、故常出入該舞臺、</p>
<p>舞臺聆曲勿聞槍聲</p>
<p>昨晚八時許、俞葉封以更新舞台新聘坤伶新豔秋來滬、現色相於紅氈氈上、海上顧曲家、一時雲集、兪遂亦忻然前往、門前車水馬龍、盛極一時、正當華燈耀目、鑼鼓喧天、舞台上排演雪夜誤走小商河楊再興歸天之際、突有槍聲發出、</p>
<p>俞中二彈均在要害</p>
<p>兪之座位、則在二樓化樓廊經理室口、其時正目注台上、背後槍聲忽起、彈如連珠、兪之胸部即被擊中一彈、左肩部亦中彈、其旁有該台之排戲職員張學炳、亦被流彈繫中右腿、闔院中座客初尙未悉底蘊、迨兪張中彈流血、驚動四座、當由該院經理室急報補房、派探到塲、並將兪張送往仁濟醫院救治、</p>
<p>無法救治傷重殞命</p>
<p>兪年　花甲、體氣已衰、抵院後、雖急施療治、終以彈中要害、即入昏迷狀態、其妾及壬雲九等聞警後，即駛往醫院、時俞已不能言語、延至九時五十五分、氣絕身死、待報請法院檢騐後、再行成殮、</p>
<p>座客震驚新伶輟演</p>
<p>出事後、顧曲仕婦女以乘興　來、原擬一聆久別重來新艷秋之名劇紅拂傳、然因事出突兀、爲戒備計、當時即行輟演、以致座客紛紛懊喪而返、捕房探捕到達該台後、即四出搜索、然兇手則已於人叢中竄去、</p>
<p>一年之前遇險倖免</p>
<p>兪寓居法租界亞爾培路五〇〇弄逸安里十號、備有汽車、遺一子、名雲九、曾留學東滴、現在戈登路靜安寺路弘毅中學任副校長出事時、兪雲九亦在座、按兪曾於二十七年六月二十四日新新旅館四零七號發生槍殺案時兪亦在塲、幸獲倖免於難、此次復遭槍殺、距上次遇險、約爲一年半、</p>

<p>— 立</p>
<p>（續）（二）嚴厲法律制裁　正當商人，貿遷有無，以逐什一之利，誰也不能詛咒他。可是一班米蟲；或是素來本不是米蟲，見錢眼紅，利用時機，竟乃昧着良心，把人們唯一的米糧，壟斷操縱，價格漲到從來所未有。這種人要是不拿法律來嚴厲制裁，小則擾亂社會，大則威海國家，其爲禍誠不堪設想。一招非常時期農鑛工商管理條例第十二條規定，「指定之企業及物品，其生產者及經營者，不得有投機壟斷或其他操縱行爲，」那末食糧，係指定物品之一，規定於同條例第一條第三款，當然不得有壟斷或操縱。如果利令智昏，違反規定，就是犯罪行爲。依同條例第三十一條規定，應處五年以下有期徒刑，並科所得利益一倍至三倍的罰金。非但實施壟斷操縱的人，應該犯罪科刑，即使銷售食糧的米號，同業當中互爲買賣的數量，如果超過實存現貨的數量，或者依標準物買賣和以差金計算盈虧，或者非同業而互爲買賣期貨，或者設立類似交易所的市場，這種意圖投機操縱的也是犯罪行爲，和以前的一樣科刑，不分高下，這是非常時期許定物價及取締投機操縱辦法第十三條所規定。兩種法律，均經公布，上海特區法院自當適用。日前上海第二特區法院推事蔣禮泉先生已有意見發表過，依照上海公共租界中國法院之協定第二條和上海法租界設置中國法院之協定第三條規定，認爲可以適用，我們何必把他們隱瞞不盡量舉發呢？</p>
<p>（三）設法疏通來源　產米區域，米糧實在過剩；不過運輸來滬，都被特殊勢力攔阻，無論水陸，兩不能通。物以稀爲貴，可見得國米漲價，不但是米蟲囤積居奇，還有其他原因，米蟲奸商，利用時機罷了。兩租界當局爲顧全界內民生，限制售價，厚意可感！但是一方面還須要和特勢力的人，盡力交涉，使米糧得以自由輸入；如果辦不到這一點居民永遠的要吃四十元一彈的米。恐怕上海的繁榮，就要變爲過去的陳跡，不能繼續的保持了。這樣米珠薪桂，跟着百物都受影響，逐日上漲。試問薪工階級的人，每月賺到三四十元，拿來買米還嫌不足，狡點者流而爲盜賊，謹願者逼而至內地，這是自然的趨勢，可以意想得到的。到那時界內繁榮，不知道又將怎樣能夠維持下去？</p>
<p>上面所講，第一點和第三點是關於行政方面的，第二點是關於法律方面的，同時並行，租界當局和居民共同努力：不但米價可以抑平，而且影響到各種物價，也一定不小。</p>

<p>麥價昨日又創新高價、管店及蘇州白麥開價竟達十八元之高峰、可謂盛極一時矣、蓋目下澳洲洋麥定價高貴、及船位不多、各廠亦未必大批訂購、而國麥存到兩枯、實有供不敷求之憾、故售手一味居奇、市面日益昂騰、昨日市塲成交蘇管麥三四車、價十八元至十七元五角、尙有阜豐廠辦去蘇錫麥二千包、價十七元二角、福新廠暫不收進云、</p>

<p>— 李紹忠</p>
<p>雲年十二月　十七日晨時開始，迄以後數日中，土耳其不幸發生空前的大震災。據土耳其官方　近發表的調查報告，單是愛辛坎　地，死亡人數達一萬四千之多。其他加西期·約加特·西瑪西亞·托卡特等地罹難者，共約一萬二千人，受傷者約四千人。而災區劫後餘生，都將移往他處，地震區域將變成「無人之境」。</p>
<p>本來，生命的死傷與財產的損失，爲大地震發生後必有的結果。往往在幾分鐘之內，生命的死傷大足驚人。例如一七五五年里斯本人地震中，死亡五萬人；一九二〇年中國的大地震，死亡十八萬人；一九二二年日本大地震時，死亡二十萬人；而在我們所知道的統計數字中，地震時死亡的人數，要推一七三七年印度大地震中死亡三十萬人的一次，爲最多了。上述數字，還不免有故意誇大的地方，但關於一九二三年日本大震災死傷人數的統計，却不會有錯誤的。在那次著名的日本大地震中，死亡九九•三三一人，受傷者有一〇三·七三三人（包括因震時火災所死傷的人數。）</p>
<p>直到目前爲止，我們還沒有能直　控制地震的力量。但我們已可以努力設法去减輕地震的破壞力：第一是預測地震的發生，及早準備遷地爲良；第二是建築物位置與形式適常的選擇，以减輕地震時受損的程度。關於預測地震的研究，現在還正在發軔的階段，不過已得到相當的成績了。至於建築物適常位置的選擇，據過去事實經騐所示，我們知道在堅固石岩上的建築物，地震時受損最小，建築在軟質土地上的房屋次之，而以「新成」土地上的房屋危險最大，尤其是在塡塞的池沼或河浜之上。所以在地震多的地方，建築房屋應避免鄰近崖邊或河畔。在日本及其地多地震的國家，對於建築物的形式和構造，早已十分注意了。根據一九二三年日本人地震時的情形來看，凡磚石房屋，最易受震被毁，木屋則頗能保持不倒，不過其唯一的缺點，就是容易加速火災的蔓延，近代的鋼磚房屋，則頗有扒制地震與火災的功效。</p>

<h3 id="c92">車上叢書 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— 曹靈佑</p>
<p>我們都知道，處在這二十世紀的人，必須不斷的增智識；不然就跟不上時代，成爲落伍之流，變成腐儒的頭腦。我們更要時時不斷的增廣我們自己的世界，使之遼遠而廣闊，才能享受豐富趣味的人生。</p>
<p>但是處身在這繁　的都市上海，生活問題的解決，工作的繫重，都足以阻礙我們增進智識。我們大部份的智識得自書本，試問有幾人能每天抽出一小時的時間去閱讀書本，謀己身之改進？但住在上海的人，從東到西，從西到東來來去去，都是靠着車輛以求便捷。旣然這樣，那麼每個人每天必有相當時間在車輛中，所以在車上的時間，實在可以利用來讀書的。</p>
<p>前幾年報上說英國有一位四十餘歲的老先生，每日至辦公室，在往返的電車中，閱讀法律書籍，積十餘年，報名應法官考試，雖因其學歷不合考試程序而未被錄取，但全塲考卷，彼固名列前茅，被錄爲名譽法官。消息傳出，成爲　談。由此可知車中的時間，如　於利用，其成就實亦不小。從另一方面來看，在顚簸的車上閱讀，有害眼睛，所以也許是得不償失的。因此就有『車上叢書』之建議。</p>
<p>有一位有名的外國敎育家，名古立克者，曾建議編『車上叢書』，頗足取效。他以爲車上叢書』中的字，字體應較普通書籍的字體大，行間亦宜較闊，至於書之內容，務求含有趣味，避免枯燥之弊。更要從看書而引起思索，使眼力不致使用過度。</p>
<p>這是一個小小的建議，我希望賢達之士，發表高見。同時史然誠地希望出版家能够採納實行。</p>

<p>— 夢谷</p>
<p>以虐待猶太人而名聞世界的德國秘密警察，據說最近發明了一種執行死刑的新法。這方法是很容易做的，可是僅在德國執行才有效。他們把犯人的眼睛用布紥了起來，叫他向前平伸雙手，把手掌展開，然後把一塊牛油和鹹肉放在犯人的掌上。一切準備好了以後，便把犯人眼上所紮的布解去。犯人突然看見手中有牛油和鹹肉，驚喜以死。</p>
<p>自從獨裁者出世以後，全世界各地便不約而同地產生了不少關於獨裁者的神話。上面所說的執行死刑新法，當然不是事實，不過是最近巴黎所流行的神話而已。可是希特勒把德國民衆購買牛油的錢都拿去買大砲了，民衆挨飢忍餓，把牛油鹹肉看成求之不得的東西。如果手中突然有天上掉下來的牛油鹹肉，其不驚喜而死者幾希。</p>

<h3 id="c96">腳跟中的諜報 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— 佳歷</p>
<p>當一九一四年德軍以狂風暴雨式的戰略橫掃蕞爾小國比利時之際，有位比國傷兵，名浮勃魯克，跟着一批流離失所的難民，　過荷蘭國境，進入某醫院求治。他的傷痕是在左脚後跟上面。</p>
<p>經過醫生施行手術和相常時期的休養後，浮勃魯克的創傷也就痊愈了，他便拾起他的拐杖，跑到外科醫生的辦公室去請求出院。當時湊巧有個英國人對那位醫生說，要找一個妥常可靠的人，帶件諜報到德軍佔領的安特瓦埠，交給一位英國諜報機關的人員。浮勃魯克在小學裏曾學些初級英文，所以他們的話都給他聽見了。</p>
<p>浮勃魯克故意咳嗽得很響，伸出他那綳紥　的脚說：「把諜報藏在我的傷口裏罷。」</p>
<p>在幾分鐘之內，那位荷蘭的外科醫生和英國人，都相信浮勃魯克不致於立刻去做烈士，或蹈了偵探小說中助手遇難的覆轍，他們就決意把那件使命交給浮勃魯克去執行。因此浮勃魯克立刻被送入手術室裏，那位醫生將他那已經痊愈的傷口再割開，把放着諜報的銀質小管子塞進去。到了新傷痕充份收口之時，浮勃魯克穿着和普通人一樣的衣服，扶着拐杖，一搖一跛地走出了醫院。</p>
<p>他如何抵達安特瓦埠無人知道，因爲他未　對人提起過。他的脚　經過第二次的手術，結果那位英國諜報處的職員，也就得到他的情報了。</p>

<p>張君秋無端被捕</p>
<p>去歲坤伶新艷秋在平因特殊原因，一度被捕。某方原擬處之於死，幸經所謂「金司令」者，爲新緩頰，始得釋放，但新伶則已飽受虛驚。最近名旦張君秋亦遭某方逮捕，據云有人對君秋吿發，謂其家藏有收音機多架，與政治有關，因而發生意外，實則風馬牛不相及也。君秋被捕後，多方營救無效，旋亦由「金司令」保釋，得能恢復自由，「金司令」爲一女性，以其在平，具有特殊勢力，故梨園中人頗有與之接近者。</p>
<p>金仲仁與荀慧生</p>
<p>小生與旦角演戲方面，極有關係，四大名旦之小生，皆多年搭擋，從不易人，自兪振飛與程硯秋拆夥後，最近金仲仁又與荀慧生脫離，仲仁與慧生合作，已十餘載，慧生之傑作如「十三妹」「花田錯」「玉堂春」等戲，非仲仁爲配，難見精彩，中間慧生雖嘗一度與仲仁分手，改邀陳盛泰，但爲時不久，慧生以盛泰不能勝任，又重邀仲仁加入，慧生對仲仁之重視，由此可見一斑。故此次毅然與金仲仁脫離，殊出一般人之意料，聞此事之起因，在於上次仲仁隨王玉蓉南來，玉蓉之配角，除金外，餘如朱斌仙孫甫亭，皆荀之班底，荀以此三人去，影響本人演戲頗大，雖仲仁臨行，嘗向慧生吿假，慧生則以爲待金素厚，實不應置之不顧，因而大不以爲然，致金返平後，未能重入荀之慶生社，而慶生社之小生一角，已改邀戲曲學校之徐和才抵補矣。此外小丑朱斌仙，因慧生已長期邀妥馬富祿，亦無形與荀拆擋，斌仙原係繼富祿後，而入慶生社者，荀之捨斌仙而用富祿，尙有可說，惟仲仁與慧生相處多年，今竟分散，實令人爲之惋惜不已也。</p>
<p>譚富英之叫小番</p>
<p>前歲譚富英張君秋出演黃金，轟動一時，譚貼各戲，無不賣滿堂，尤以「探母」「二進宮」二戲爲最。惟上次富英在黃金唱過四次「探母」，「站立宮門叫小番」一句之戞調，均未使好，第四次出演之前，乃父小培，曾囑富英在家預先練習，富英使勁喊「叫小番」數十餘聲，結果成績頗佳，及至台上，則「叫小番」依然叫不上去也。邇時富英在平出演，號召之大，不亞於馬運良，平常出演，票價售　元二角，逢貼「探母」，則座價漲至二元，每貼此戲，輒賣滿堂，美中不足者，「叫小番」之戞調，仍未能應付裕如。據云富英在家吊嗓時，必唱「叫小番」數次，而每次都叫得挺好，一到台上，便叫不出來，亦怪事也。</p>

<p>武安席上見雙鬟，</p>
<p>血淚蛾眉陷賊還，</p>
<p>不爲君親來故國，</p>
<p>却爲女子下雄關。</p>
<p>在吳梅村的詩句里，他把吳三桂的引狼入室，屈膝媚異，完全歸之於「衝冠一怒爲紅顏」，這或者是「女人是禍水」的下意識表現，但是在一般刻意煊染「英雄美人」的傳奇中，作者們往往都是忽略了當時的政治社會背景，而以「兒女情長」使後之人感喟無已。蔣旂的「陳圓圓」，是脫離「傾國傾城」的舊的範疇，他並不以陳圓圓爲中心，而是通過了陳圓圓這一人物的時代背景來批判吳三桂與李闖的兩種不同的政治傾向。他在「誰是陳圓圓」中，有這樣一段：「歷史家們總算沒有抹煞良心，他們寫出了吳三桂是怎樣甘心薙髮蓄辮，投降滿淸，怎樣苦苦追逼，把李闖逼得山窮水盡；又怎樣殘忍慘酷，親手殺死了明朝最後的一滴血統，——永歷帝。在無意中，我們却發覺了吳三桂不完全爲陳圓圓而才背叛祖國，投降敵人的反證，倒正相反吿訴我們，吳三桂是主要因爲他的政治野心而才這樣甘心傾國的。」因之，舞台上的「陳圓圓」，與其說在收回陳圓圓的淸白，毋寗說是使我們看淸楚吳三桂的面目。　（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e4">Talk by Japanese Army Commander Honma in Tianjin: Japan's Goal is to Destroy British Interests in North China; No Anti-American Movement in North China Because America Does Not Control Any Part Therein <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin: The Japanese Army Commander in Tianjin, Honma, stated today that the goal of the Japanese army in China is to eliminate foreign domination. However, since America does not control any part of China, there is no anti-American movement in North China. As for Britain, it is in a position of control in North China, and therefore the people have expressed anti-British sentiments. However, the American side believes that we have anti-American actions, which is purely due to a failure to clearly understand Japan's goals. He also said that although Japan's goal is to destroy British dominance in North China, it will not necessarily harm the businesses of British and other foreigners in North China. Honma continued, "After the expiration of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty, we hope to establish a temporary agreement with the US. If the US exempts Japanese goods or ships from special taxes, Japan will be satisfied. Therefore, Japan's intention is to first establish a temporary agreement with the US." According to Honma, America's intention to establish defenses in Guam is worse than abolishing the US-Japan Commercial Treaty. In short, if the US does not conclude a new commercial treaty with Japan and also establishes defenses in Guam, Japan will inevitably regard this action by the US as unfriendly.

<h3 id="e7">Six Japanese Writers Conduct Radio Propaganda for China on the Guilin Front, Led by Wataru Nukada, Urging Soldiers Not to Fight for Warlords <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: Several well-known Japanese writers are currently assisting the Chinese authorities in Nanning by conducting radio propaganda in Japanese, urging Japanese soldiers not to fight for their warlords. There are six of them, led by Wataru Nukada, who are members of the Japanese Anti-War Association in China. They arrived in Guilin Province on December 28th of last year and immediately inspected the positions of the Chinese army to select suitable locations for broadcasting. They have broadcasted for six nights so far. The first broadcast was made on December 29th on a mountain northeast of Kunlun Pass. At that time, the Chinese army was fiercely attacking the key pass. When the broadcast began, the Chinese army stopped firing as planned to avoid disturbing the sound waves. At that time, the Japanese army was only 300 meters away from the broadcast location. As soon as a certain Japanese writer spoke, saying, "Hey, our dear Japanese compatriots," the sound of Japanese machine guns immediately rang out. As soon as the gunfire stopped, the Japanese member continued to speak. They were located on a mountain 2,000 meters high, and the night was quiet, so the voices were very clear. The conclusion was to give the Japanese army one hour to surrender, with three shots fired into the air as a signal. When the deadline arrived, the Japanese army guarding the pass did not respond, so the Chinese army continued to open fire and attack. According to the Chinese side, the radio propaganda has been very effective. Although no Japanese soldiers surrendered, when the Chinese army attacked the next morning, the Japanese army offered only slight resistance, unlike the fierce resistance before. When the Chinese army advanced south towards Nanning, these six Japanese writers continued to broadcast on the front line. Each person had a pistol, according to their leader, Wataru Nukada, this was to prevent being captured by the Japanese army, as they would inevitably not be spared and it would be better to commit suicide. Wataru Nukada also stated that they will continue to broadcast to Japanese soldiers on the front line. (Reuters report, 15th)</p>

<p>Chongqing: According to official sources, the Chinese authorities are currently striving to build new highways and improve existing highways. The National Government has allocated 12 million yuan for the improvement of the 960-kilometer-long Yunnan-Burma Highway, so that it can remain open to traffic as usual during the rainy season. It is reported that the average daily traffic on this road is 600 tons. It is estimated that the annual maintenance expenses for this road will require 8-9 million yuan, while the annual highway maintenance fees collected will amount to approximately 4 million yuan. Currently, the total length of highways in the southwestern provinces is 4,789 kilometers, and in the northwestern provinces, it is 3,400 kilometers. (Reuters report, 15th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to news received here today, the Ministry of Communications is now allocating huge funds to improve highways in the Chinese interior.

<h3 id="e11">Change of Japanese Cabinet: Used to Alleviate Domestic Crisis; Chongqing Personage's Observation of Yonai's Cabinet Formation <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: Official sources are still not commenting on the new Japanese cabinet today, awaiting the disclosure of the full list of cabinet members. However, according to Chinese sources familiar with Japanese affairs, the Yonai cabinet may be a transitional cabinet during a chaotic period until a more suitable person is found for the position of Prime Minister. Yonai, in the Konoe and Hiranuma cabinets, had vigorously opposed Japan's conclusion of a military alliance with Germany and Italy. Yonai studied in Britain and is known in Japan as a "liberal." His selection this time may be because Japan intends to adopt a compromise policy towards Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. At the same time, it is also because it is difficult for another army figure to control the lower-ranking officers of the army. This is why the initial call for Army Minister Hata Shunroku was very high, because Hata Shunroku is a "conservative" figure who earned credit in the Battle of Hankou, and it is widely believed that he can control the young and middle-aged elements in the army. The Abe cabinet lasted four months and eighteen days. Before that, Japan had a total of thirty-seven cabinets, of which nine were organized by army ministers and five by navy ministers. Generally speaking, Japanese cabinets last longer when facing acute international situations, but they are very short-lived when encountering domestic disputes. The Yonai cabinet may not be colorful, because it does not have the full support of the army, nor does it have the support of overseas elements to change Japan's international relations. Chinese sources believe that Konoe and Hata Shunroku's refusal to accept the position of Prime Minister shows that important factions still disagree on extremely important issues, such as the "China Incident" and policies towards the United States. Some people here believe that the main purpose of electing Yonai is to find someone to cope with the upcoming Diet session. The new Prime Minister opposes Itagaki's policies and is especially opposed to the alliance with Germany and Italy and economic mobilization. Therefore, Yonai may be able to alleviate the relationship between the various parties in the Diet and financial and industrial groups. After the domestic crisis is temporarily eased, Yonai will be replaced by someone who is widely believed to be able to resolve the Sino-Japanese issue and serve as Prime Minister.

<h3 id="e14">The New Japanese Cabinet and US-Japan Relations <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>We have already briefly reviewed the downfall of the Japanese Abe cabinet in yesterday's newspaper. After much effort, Mitsumasa Yonai, who was ordered to organize the successor cabinet, has finalized the selection of all cabinet members. Yonai is a navy admiral, a prominent figure among the navy militarists, but he is also relatively gentle and stable. The new Foreign Minister is Hachiro Arita. If the Japanese militarists do not just allow him to be a phonograph, only allowing him to be a spokesperson, he should be able to follow the general laws of international diplomacy; compared to Abe's initial self-serving as Foreign Minister, and even later inviting General Nomura to be Foreign Minister, although they were not phonographs or spokespersons, in terms of the diplomatic stage, they were ultimately like "amateurs" or "cross-dressers." If we talk about international standards: Arita is not a magnificent diplomat, but he is still a capable and competent diplomat. Does Japan have diplomats? Especially in this era where militarists are in power, invasion has failed and they cannot repent, can diplomats be produced? This is another question, not to be discussed; but even if diplomats are capable and competent, it will ultimately be of no avail. Arita's debut this time will probably not win a cheer! It is not that Arita is not good enough, but because Japan's foundation is precarious, and it is even more deeply involved in misguided paths. Even if diplomats are tongue-tied and exhausted, what help can they provide?</p>
<p>The debut, ten days from now, the US-Japan Commercial Treaty will expire on the 26th of this month. On the American side, the attitude of both the government and the public is firm: on the Japanese side, although the new cabinet will declare its attitude when it is fully organized, the public opinion circle has expressed various tough arguments. For example, the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun stated that if the "New Order in East Asia" and the US-Japan Commercial Treaty are not compatible, it would rather abandon the latter; the military's mouthpiece, the Miyako Shimbun, predicted that the future new cabinet should adopt a more resolute attitude towards the United States and create a more friendly atmosphere between the Soviet Union and Japan. Rather than thinking of these expressions as the political views of a certain group of people, it is actually better to say that they are a kind of external intimidation. Because it is extremely obvious that small Japan cannot replace America with the Soviet Union, and if there is no supply of American military materials, the establishment of the so-called "New Order in East Asia" will also become a bubble. Even in terms of the Japanese political situation, although the cabinet has been changed, unless the elder statesmen and financial groups completely lose control, or the extreme right wing of the military forces Yonai and Arita to act, perhaps they will really embark on a path of being pro-Soviet and anti-American; otherwise, the diplomacy afterwards will not be a so-called policy, it will only be that diplomats will do their best to respond to the situation; at most, they will make more partial concessions in an attempt to ease the foreign opposition.</p>
<p>Looking at the recent American public opinion towards Japan, it is actually becoming more and more激昂(aroused); even for the government authorities and Mr. Pittman and others, although their attitude is slightly more cautious, their fundamental starting point is actually the same as the most radical anti-Japanese theorists, coming from justice, humanity, and the maintenance of the Nine-Power Treaty. It is definitely not just about respecting and maintaining rights and interests in China. Even if Japan's concessions reach the maximum extent, it will only give some excuses and new materials to the American propagandists and some Americans who only care about immediate interests; it is not enough to ease the general American sentiment towards Japan, and it is even more not enough to shake America's determination to stabilize the Far East situation, or reduce America's established policy. So the central question at the moment is not what Japan's public opinion stance is, or what the diplomat's skills are, but how to enable President Roosevelt of the United States and other government and public figures to implement their great vision.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also considerable differences in opinion among Americans; for example, in reviewing Stimson's recent paper, the New York Times raised the issue of other countries' attitudes toward Japan; implying that the United States also has room to hesitate. We do not object to the United States'휴休有容 (easy and tolerant) approach, giving Japan the opportunity to maintain its glory and correct itself, change itself, and voluntarily abandon its policy of aggression; but from July 26 of last year to the present, Japan has not made good use of this half-year opportunity. Therefore, we believe that what the New York Times discusses should be given leeway in application, but it must also be limited; and in terms of morality and interests, we must recognize that there is absolutely no room for compromise. In the eight or nine years since the "September 18th" Incident, there have indeed been many opportunities to contain aggression and eliminate the crisis in the Far East, but it was only due to the inertia of the leaders of the great powers, disordered steps, indecisiveness, 寡斷優柔 (irresolution),養癰貽忠 (nurturing a boil to the detriment of the body), which led to the uncontrollable spread of the sparks of fire, threatening the安髯 (tranquility) of the whole world, and indirectly promoting the outbreak of storms in Europe. And now Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and other countries have already been involved in the vortex of war, and at this time, it is certainly no longer possible to lavishly talk about coordinating policy towards Japan; however, regardless of how the interests of various countries are related in other respects, if we only talk about the Far East, the threats and persecutions they have suffered from Japan are actually always the same for all countries. What's more, the day that the basic military deployment of the Japanese warlords' southward and northward advances is completed, they can be put into use at any time. Even if the great powers do not abandon their policy of using Japan as bait to flood the neighbors, it will at most only be enough to maintain a temporary peace, but on the other hand, they are precisely making it a tool for the Japanese warlords to threaten other countries, which is harmful and unprofitable to both others and themselves. Counting all the great powers related to the Far East, there is no country that has common interests with Japan today, and no country benefits from Japan's conquest of China. This is absolutely without a second conclusion in terms of morality and interests. If the countries cannot come to the same conclusion, then it is absolutely not enough to guarantee their significant rights and interests in the Far East, nor is it enough to eliminate the serious threats they are suffering in the Far East. Today's America is the largest power that has not been drawn into the war, and is also the most powerful protector of world justice and order. Its use of foreign policy can be independent, and it does not need to consult other countries, and the Far East policy of various countries will inevitably tend to stabilize due to the strength of the American attitude. Japan has historically been unable to understand the meaning and determination of the United States, and has repeatedly made mistakes; now that it can understand the United States fairly well, but as in the Hiranuma and Abe eras, wanting to use Germany and the Soviet Union, as well as the recent虛聲恐嚇 (empty threats) of the Mainichi Shimbun and the Miyako Shimbun, have revealed that Japan still does not understand that the interests of various countries and the United States in the Far East are consistent. Yonai and Arita's debut may not be able to do much, but being able to correct the domestic lack of understanding of the international situation is a contribution to the country. Whether Yonai and Arita can make this contribution can be glimpsed at the time of the expiration of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Japan Hopes to Conclude a Temporary Commercial Treaty, Awaiting a Reply from the United States. The U.S. Government Apparently Unwilling to Change Its Stance, Demanding Japanese Guarantees of American Interests in China. <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Washington - Official sources stated today that the U.S.-Japan trade crisis triggered by the Washington government's declaration to abolish the 1911 U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty has reached a stalemate. There is no hope of signing a transitional treaty before the expiration of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty on the 26th of this month. Secretary of State Hull remained tight-lipped about the resignation of the Abe Cabinet in Tokyo, but the U.S. State Department's attitude clearly has not changed, namely, that Japan must bear full responsibility for any actions to improve U.S.-Japan relations. It is generally believed that the State Department's attitude is that Japan must prove that it is prepared to protect American interests in China. Well-informed sources indicated that if the State Department cannot obtain satisfactory guarantees from the new Japanese cabinet within a reasonable period, Congress is free to enact measures to prohibit the export of arms and raw materials to Japan. They also indicated that if the Tokyo government cannot protect American interests in China, Hull may expand the scope of moral sanctions against Japan, prohibiting the export of certain military supplies to Japan. The Japanese Embassy here declined to comment on the future of U.S.-Japan trade. Japanese Ambassador to the United States Kensuke Horinouchi was bedridden yesterday due to influenza, but embassy staff worked throughout Sunday, extremely busy. U.S. officials believe that the Japanese Yonai Mitsumasa cabinet, with Hachiro Arita as Foreign Minister, may adopt a friendly attitude towards the United States. (United Press Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated to reporters this morning that Japan hopes the U.S. State Department will take action before January 16th (the date of expiration of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty). It is expected that the continuation of Japan's foreign policy will remain unchanged. Japanese Ambassador to the United States Horinouchi submitted a draft of a temporary agreement to U.S. Secretary of State Hull on December 23rd, but he could not say for sure what form the temporary agreement would take if it were concluded, as there are several possible forms, such as an exchange of diplomatic notes between the two countries. Regarding the issue of the "new central government" in China, according to news from China, preparations by the Chinese for the establishment of a new regime are "proceeding smoothly." Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the orthodox Kuomintang, Wang Kemin, head of the Beiping Provisional Government, and Liang Hongzhi, head of the Nanjing "Reform Government," the "three giants," are about to hold a meeting, but he declined to disclose the date and location of this meeting. As for the incident on Christmas Day when Japanese soldiers burned down the United Methodist Church Hospital near Wuding Prefecture in Shandong Province, the spokesman said he was unaware of the matter and believed that the British side had not lodged a protest. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Washington - With only a few days remaining before the current U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty expires on January 26th, official circles have remained tight-lipped about the future of U.S.-Japan relations. At the same time, irresponsible rumors have been rife. One thing that can be considered accurate is that a new treaty cannot be signed solely by the President. While the President can use his authority to abolish a treaty, only Congress can establish a new one. The general expectation in diplomatic circles here is that after January 26th, the measures contained in the current commercial treaty will be temporarily allowed to continue, so that neither new treaties are negotiated, nor are there drastic changes to the existing measures. However, it must be stated that official circles have not acknowledged the above predictions, so the true state of U.S.-Japan relations cannot be known until official circles break their silence.

<p>Tokyo - The Yonai Cabinet has recently been formed, with the following lineup: Prime Minister, Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai; Foreign Minister, former Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita; Interior Minister, Hideo Kodama; Finance Minister, Sakio Sakurauchi of the Minseito party; Army Minister, General Shunroku Hata (retained); Navy Minister, Admiral Zengo Yoshida (retained); Justice Minister, Chief Prosecutor Naotatsu Kimura; Education Minister, Privy Councilor Townjirou Matsuura; Agriculture Minister, Toshio Shimada of the Seiyukai's Nakajima faction; Commerce Minister, Ginjiro Fujiwara; Communications Minister, Masasame Katsu of the Minseito party; Railways Minister, Tsuruhei Matsuno of the Seiyukai's Kuhara faction; Colonial Affairs Minister, General Kuniaki Koiso; Welfare Minister, Shigeru Yoshida (former Chief Cabinet Secretary); Chief Cabinet Secretary, Jotaro Ishiwata (former Finance Minister); Director-General of the Legislation Bureau, Hisatada Hirose (former Welfare Minister). (Domei News Agency, 15th) After Emperor conferred on former Navy Minister Admiral Yonai the mandate to form a cabinet, he summoned former Army Minister General Shunroku Hata for consultation. According to General Hata's statement upon returning to the Ministry of the Army, the Emperor earnestly hoped that the Army would assist Admiral Yonai in forming a new cabinet. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Admiral Yonai, upon receiving the mandate to form a cabinet, will personally serve as Chairman of the Cabinet, and will simultaneously be placed on the reserve list in accordance with the Navy Military Service Ordinance. However, in view of Admiral Yonai's achievements and his flexible political skills, the Navy authorities hope that Yonai will remain an active-duty military officer and are currently studying the procedures and methods. (Domei News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - As a result of deliberations at the Cabinet Formation Headquarters, it was decided to request that the Minseito and Seiyukai parties each send two members to the cabinet. Yonai also hopes that the heads of both parties will enter the cabinet, and is scheduled to invite representatives from both parties today to express their views. (Domei News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - After former Navy Minister Admiral Yonai was ordered to form a cabinet, foreign observers here have commented that Admiral Yonai has long opposed the idea of concluding a military alliance with Germany, and this idea ultimately failed. As for his attitude towards Britain and the United States, this man has always been moderate. For this reason, the Yonai Cabinet is likely to reverse the actions of the previous Abe Cabinet, no longer pursuing the Soviet Union, but instead seeking to establish normal relations with Britain and the United States. It is expected that this policy will gain the support of the majority of the people in the country. As for former Army Minister General Shunroku Hata, there was an original proposal for him to form a cabinet, and the Army leadership even resolved on the morning of today to allow an active-duty general to serve as prime minister, but General Hata ultimately refused to form a cabinet. The reason for this is that some ten aspects of the military were deeply concerned that if a cabinet headed by an active-duty general adopted decisions opposed by the military in the future, it would cause a subtle situation. Therefore, they were vehemently opposed to the proposal for General Hata to serve as prime minister. Furthermore, it is widely rumored among political circles that the reason why powerful elements of the Japanese moderate faction advocated that General Shunroku Hata form a cabinet was that they secretly hoped that he would fail due to incompetence, so that the military would never interfere in politics again. For these reasons, although the Army leadership allowed an active-duty general to form a cabinet, it was on the condition that the general retire from active duty after the successful formation of the cabinet. General Hata reportedly told his friends, "If I take off my military uniform, I will become a child and be unable to do anything. The reason why I am valued by all parties is because I wear a military sword. Moreover, it is the military, not the government itself, that drives the government. I am willing to drive the government, but I am not comfortable being driven at the same time." (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The character of the new Yonai Cabinet is seen as a unified national cabinet of the military, political parties, and the financial world. Its mission is to handle the China Incident, with particular emphasis on actively assisting the establishment and growth of the new Chinese regime. This means implementing the basic policy on dealing with the new regime, which was decided upon by the Abe Cabinet's temple council. However, concurrently with this mission, another focus of the new cabinet is the resolution of domestic problems, which are the very problems that led to the collapse of the Abe Cabinet. The new cabinet will constantly exert its utmost efforts to implement wartime fiscal policies and stabilize the lives of the people. Therefore, it will exercise particularly careful judgement regarding the selection of so-called economic cabinet ministers, such as the Finance Minister, the Minister of Commerce and Industry, and the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry.

<h3 id="e17">Soviet Union Lodges Serious Protest Against Anti-Soviet Movements in Sweden and Norway; Accuses the Two Countries of Violating Neutrality Policy with Anti-Soviet Attitudes; Sufficient to Cause Unfavorable Disputes and Disrupt Normal Relations; The Two Countries' Replies Deny Accusations <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Moscow - The Soviet government has recently taken note of the facts displayed by Norway and Sweden. News agencies and certain officials closely related to the two governments have begun a large-scale anti-Soviet movement with the assistance of the authorities in the two countries and have taken actions that violate the neutrality policy of the two governments. Regarding these facts, the Soviet government has authorized its ambassadors to Norway and Sweden to lodge protests with the governments of the two countries. On January 5th, Soviet Ambassador to Sweden, Krountai, representing the Soviet government, sent a document to Swedish Foreign Minister Günther. The document stated, "In December, anti-Soviet newspapers and other parties, under the leadership of the 'Social Democratic Newspaper,' which has close ties with the government, began an inappropriate anti-Soviet movement. Unless Sweden and the Soviet Union were at war or Sweden was prepared to wage war against the Soviet Union, this movement could not be allowed to exist."</p>
<p>At the same time, Swedish newspapers have directly appealed to the people to fight against the Soviet Union and have demanded that Sweden assist the "Tanner" and "Ryti" governments with force in their war against the Soviet Union. The Swedish government has not stopped this movement, which is sufficient to cause disputes between the two countries. What is even more serious is that some officials have openly participated in organizations that assist the Tanner and Ryti governments with force. As of December 7th, there were 47 recruiting offices in Swedish cities under the protection of the Swedish authorities, and tens of thousands of "volunteers" have been recruited. According to reports, as of December 8th, 10,000 "volunteers" had arrived in Finland from Sweden. Reports then stated that two teams of "volunteers" had left central and southern Sweden for Finland and were commanded by Swedish General Linder. Swedish newspapers have both called for military action against the Soviet Union and, with the assistance of the Swedish authorities, have openly demanded the organization of "volunteer armies." In addition, they have directly supplied the Tanner and Ryti governments with arms and ammunition and have allowed arms and ammunition to be transported to Finland through Sweden. Regarding the above facts and the anti-Soviet actions of the Swedish authorities, the Soviet government solemnly requests the Swedish government to take note. The Soviet government believes that this action by the Swedish authorities not only violates Sweden's neutrality policy but will also cause unfavorable disputes in relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>Also on the same day (January 5th), Soviet Ambassador to Norway, Plothnikov, also representing the Soviet government, delivered a document to Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht, stating, "Recently, certain Norwegian parties and Norwegian newspapers with close ties to the government have conducted an unrestrained anti-Soviet movement. This movement will inevitably cause disputes in relations between the Soviet Union and Norway." Norwegian newspapers, in addition to directly appealing to fight against the Soviet Union, have also demanded that military force be used to assist the Tanner and Ryti governments in their war against the Soviet Union. Some officials, such as Halbach, have even participated in this movement. At the same time, recruitment committees have been established throughout Norway to incite war against the Soviet Union. It is reported that the "Oslo" group is organizing a division of "volunteers" to go to Finland. In addition, under the protection of the Norwegian authorities, Norway has supplied Finland with arms and ammunition, and various military materials have been transported to Finland through Norway. Regarding the above facts and the anti-Soviet actions of the Norwegian authorities, the Soviet government specifically requests the Norwegian government to pay close attention. At the same time, the Soviet government believes that it must solemnly state to the Norwegian government that the actions of the Norwegian authorities not only violate Norway's neutrality policy but are also bound to cause unfavorable disputes, further damaging the normal relations between the two countries. (TASS, 15th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden - Swedish newspapers have reprinted the exchange of notes between the Swedish and Soviet governments and solemnly declared that the Soviet government did not notify the Swedish government before publishing this exchange of notes, which is contrary to diplomatic customs. (Haitong, 15th)</p>
<p>Norwegian Government's Reply</p>
<p>Moscow - On January 6th, Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht delivered a reply to Soviet Ambassador Plothnikov, responding to the Soviet protest. In the reply, the Norwegian government pointed out that the Soviet claim that Norway had violated its neutrality policy was based on inaccurate reports. The anti-Soviet records in Norwegian newspapers were purely individual actions and had not received the support of responsible authorities. The Norwegian government had not assisted the recruitment committees established throughout Norway. Since the recruitment of soldiers for foreign countries is contrary to Norwegian law, the Norwegian authorities would not allow it to proceed. For the same reason, the Norwegian authorities had not assisted in the transport of arms and ammunition to Finland. The Norwegian government believes that if individuals voluntarily go abroad to participate in war, it does not violate neutrality. Therefore, the import of arms and ammunition into other countries through Norway cannot be viewed as a violation of international law. However, to the best of the Norwegian government's knowledge, there are no arms and ammunition being transported to Finland through Norway. Even private arms exports are extremely limited. Regarding its neutrality policy, the Norwegian government has always maintained it and will continue to maintain it. Norway sincerely hopes that the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Norway will continue uninterrupted. (TASS, 15th)</p>
<p>Swedish Government's Reply</p>
<p>Moscow - On January 10th, Swedish Foreign Minister Günther replied to the Soviet protest. In the reply, the Swedish government pointed out that the Swedish people sympathize with Finland. Therefore, newspapers cannot avoid having the same tone. However, the Swedish constitution prohibits newspapers from abusing the right to freedom of speech, and especially opposes newspapers insulting foreign representatives and powers. The Swedish government believes that neither in newspapers nor in other aspects has it given the Soviet Union a reason to criticize Sweden. The Soviet accusations are based on inaccurate reports, especially regarding the recruitment of volunteers, which is absolutely not in accordance with the facts. The Swedish recruitment of volunteers is purely an individual action, and the numbers are different from those pointed out by the Soviet government. In short, the Swedish authorities have not assisted in the recruitment of volunteers. Even officers of the Swedish army have not gone to Finland to participate in the war. As for military supplies transported from Sweden or through Sweden to Finland, there is no reason to oppose this action. Sweden strives to maintain trade relations with all countries. Finland can obtain imports from Sweden, and Finland can also obtain goods it needs through Sweden. The Swedish government believes that there is no need to change this situation and hinder the development of trade between Sweden and Finland. The Swedish government believes that the above statement will dispel Soviet misunderstandings and prove to the Soviet authorities that the Soviet authorities have no reason to blame Sweden. Sweden has not adopted an aggressive policy toward the Soviet Union and is willing to remove all misunderstandings between the two countries. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Soviet Union Expresses Dissatisfaction</p>
<p>Moscow - The Soviet government cannot consider the replies of Norway, especially Sweden, to the Soviet protest to be satisfactory. The Norwegian and Swedish governments have not completely denied the violations of neutrality policy. This attitude of the Norwegian and Swedish governments is dangerous. Some strong powers are attempting to drag Norway and Sweden into the war. The current attitude of the Norwegian and Swedish governments proves that they are not good at resisting the invasive forces of these strong powers. (TASS, 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e18">Italy Changes Attitude Towards the Soviet Union, Observations in British Political Circles <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>London - Political figures here have commented on the relations between Italy and the Soviet Union, saying that the Italian government has changed its attitude towards the Soviet Union. Several weeks ago, Italy stood as a pillar of anti-Bolshevism in southeastern Europe, and newspapers across the country unanimously declared that this attitude would be maintained to the end, regardless of the consequences. Until recently, the tone of the newspapers has changed. This situation occurred at a time when Britain and France were stepping up their aid to Finland, which is worthy of attention. In Italy's view, Italy may only want to use ideological arguments to strengthen its position in Europe, and has no intention of resisting the Soviet Union's intrusion into the Balkan Peninsula. If Germany expands its power in the Balkan Peninsula in conjunction with the Soviet Union, it can be even more certain that Italy no longer opposes Germany's solid position in Central and Eastern Europe. In the future, Germany may obtain Italian support and re-adopt a "peace offensive" under more favorable conditions. It is not impossible. (Havas, 14th)</p>

<p>Moscow - The Soviet Union's National Economic Bureau announced today statistics confirming that the Soviet Union's industrial production in 1939 saw a significant increase compared to 1938. Heavy industry increased by 13 percent, and light industry increased by 15 percent. Among them, the increase in production related to aviation, military supplies, armaments, and shipbuilding was the largest, reaching 9 percent.

<p>Tokyo - Regarding the great fire in Shizuoka, the city's telephone bureau received information at 3 p.m. today stating that although the fire near Shin-Tomicho, where the fire originated, had been temporarily extinguished, the flames had spread to Shichikencho on the city's main street. Fanned by strong winds of 11 meters per second, it spread further to various streets. Almost all of the southwestern main street of the city was burned down. The number of houses affected reached 1,000. The Imperial Villa, the Prefectural Office, and the Shizuoka Post Office, etc., in the government office district, are currently safe because the wind direction is opposite. However, Shizuoka Station is in danger. Therefore, both the up and down lines of the Tokaido Line are closed. Citizens are evacuating from the Chojamachi drill ground towards the Abe River. (Domei News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>Shizuoka - At approximately 11:10 a.m. on the 15th, a fire broke out in Shin-Tomicho 1-chome, Shizuoka City, affecting 14 or 15 locations throughout the city. At present (2:30 p.m.), black smoke is soaring throughout the city. Although firefighters from nearby towns and villages such as Yaizu and Shimizu have arrived to try to put out the fire, it is difficult to extinguish due to strong westerly winds. Currently, 400 or 500 homes have been burned down. (Domei News Agency, 15th)</p>

<p>Paris: Diplomatic circles here are paying close attention to the security measures taken by the Belgian and Dutch governments. However, they say that there is no reliable information to confirm whether Germany has decided to attack these countries. In particular, the army of that country had already prepared to advance into the Netherlands as early as last November. Subsequently, because the Belgian government decided to come to the aid of the Netherlands in the event of an invasion, the German government temporarily abandoned its plans. As of now, its state of military preparedness is no different from two months ago. It can launch an offensive at any time with just an order. Moreover, in reality, the repeated overflights of Belgian airspace by German aircraft, the arrival of that country's high-speed motorized units on the Dutch border, and the alarmist pronouncements in that country's newspapers all sufficiently prove that the increased preventive measures taken by the Belgian and Dutch governments are fully justified. After the freezing of the Dutch canals, the plan to flood them is difficult to implement. The German military authorities see this as an opportunity and may implement the invasion plan decided last November anew. Another theory is that the German government's deployment of troops on the Belgian and Dutch borders is actually intended to divert attention in order to launch a feint to the west and attack to the east, and take action in Central Europe. In addition, it is reported that the German transportation authorities have been ordered to repair all roads to ensure that tanks and military trucks can travel smoothly. At the same time, the military authorities of that country have also taken various military measures at the junction of the Slovak state and Hungary, and the garrison troops in the protectorates of Bohemia and Moravia have also been ordered to move to the Swiss border.

<p>Swiss Capital: Foreign radio stations have broadcast messages claiming that Germany has concentrated troops along the Swiss border. The Swiss General Staff has denied this. (Fourteenth, Havas News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris: Regarding the German threat to Belgium and the Netherlands, most newspapers here believe that although that country may launch a sudden offensive, it is unlikely to take immediate action given the current situation. Le Petit Parisien reported that regardless of what Germany decides, Britain, France, and the neutral countries are all prepared. L'Ordre reported that, as it is winter, Germany could gain an advantage by invading the Netherlands at this time. However, we cannot help but feel that if Hitler is counting on the Soviet Union to provide supplies, he must remain inactive to prolong the war. Conversely, if Germany takes offensive action on the Western Front or attacks Belgium and the Netherlands, it proves that that country no longer has faith in future Soviet supplies.

<p>Belgian Establishes General Headquarters</p>
<p>Brussels: Over the past few days, there have been widespread rumors of German plans to invade Belgium and the Netherlands. People living in villages along the Belgian border are being evacuated to other places. Neutral military observers estimate that Belgium has 700,000 soldiers. Yesterday, the Belgian General Staff took over the official announcement of military operations from the Ministry of National Defense. (Fifteenth, United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Brussels: The implementation of Belgium's mobilization order has now reached the stage of establishing a general headquarters, only one step away from the final stage of general mobilization. The general headquarters will issue orders from now on and take over the duties formerly under the Ministry of National Defense. Cafés in Brussels closed from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM today and will close again after 9:00 PM. Although the atmosphere is not particularly tense, life is somewhat as usual. Today is Sunday, and the streets are still crowded with pedestrians. Movie theaters and cafés are still full of customers. (Fifteenth, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Brussels: The general impression from well-informed sources is that no serious incidents have occurred so far, and it is believed that the situation has eased slightly. Political figures believe that the German measures are purely empty threats, the purpose of which is to ascertain the extent of Belgium's preparedness to resist a possible invasion. It is heard that Belgium has concentrated six divisions in several locations, especially in the Aix-la-Chapelle area, to counter a possible concentration of German troops. (Fifteenth, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Brussels: After the government authorities took military precautions, well-informed people here said that the Belgian military and civilians are prepared to deal with any eventuality. Anyone who dares to invade will be met with a head-on blow, as the German army encountered in 1914. However, the general public believes that the current situation has eased and that this sudden threat may disappear. It is still unknown why the government authorities suddenly strengthened their defenses. What can be said at this point is that after German newspapers fiercely attacked the neutral countries last week, their aircraft repeatedly flew over Belgian airspace and mobilized troops near the Belgian and Dutch borders. (Fifteenth, Havas News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Brussels: After Germany concentrated troops in the Belgian border area, the Belgian government ordered that all leave for army officers and soldiers be canceled, and those on leave were recalled. At the same time, the "D-Day" mobilization plan was implemented, and the residents of the three districts of Liège, Bébense, and Verviers (the German army invaded Belgium through these three districts during the previous European war) who lived near key military points were evacuated and transported by bus to central Belgium. In addition, most of the people who had previously engaged in anti-National Socialist propaganda activities in the districts of Eupen and Malmedy (formerly part of Germany before the last European war) were also ordered by the Belgian government to return to the interior. Reporters stationed in the eastern border area have also been ordered by the government to report cautiously on the various military measures there. (Fourteenth, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Brussels: Last night, the newspapers here tried their best to calm the panic among the people caused by the government's military measures. The newspapers unanimously and solemnly declared that there was no imminent crisis in Belgium, that street rumors should not be trusted, and that people should maintain a calm attitude and wait for further developments in the situation. The military measures taken by the government are motivated by the desire to strengthen border defenses, not to prepare for new events. The public should not listen to rumors and should absolutely trust the government and be aware of their responsibilities. (Fifteenth, Haitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Dutch Cabinet Convened an Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>The Hague: The Dutch cabinet convened a special emergency meeting last night to discuss the international situation caused by rumors of German plans to invade the Netherlands and Belgium. After the cabinet meeting, an official announcement was issued, saying, "Indications of an international nature have led the government to decide not to grant leave to the military." At this time, all soldiers on leave were immediately recalled to duty. The emergency order issued yesterday is similar to those issued by Belgium on Friday and Saturday. According to unconfirmed reports, German troops are concentrating other units on the southeastern border of the Netherlands. These units include rapidly moving mobile units. Dutch soldiers plan to strengthen defenses there to cope with the situation. (Fifteenth, United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Amsterdam: According to news from here tonight, the temporary suspension of leave for the Dutch army does not mean that soldiers already on leave must return to duty immediately. It only means that those currently on duty are not allowed to take leave. This morning, many soldiers who were already on leave mistakenly believed that they had to return to camp immediately and canceled their appointments during their leave. It is also heard that soldiers who are merchants on leave to manage their business, or who work in the military industry on leave, are not affected by this order. However, the Netherlands is now "militarily prepared" to deal with any developments. Over the past week, the Netherlands has experienced severe cold, with thick ice forming. Soldiers and cars can travel on the ice, but heavy mechanized transport teams or tanks cannot. Last night, the temperature was warmer, and today the ice and snow are gradually melting. Large blocks of ice in the river are now breaking up. The general situation makes it difficult for large-scale invading troops to move. (Fourteenth, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>The Hague: Over the past two days, political figures here have been quite alarmed, but they began to calm down this morning. Well-informed sources say that the Belgian government has been in close contact with the Dutch side and is currently taking a more optimistic attitude towards the international situation. (Fifteenth, Haitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>German Engineers Concentrated on the Dutch Border</p>
<p>Paris: According to news from the German border, engineering units of that country have been concentrated in various places near the Dutch border, especially in Bocholt, Burlo, and Wesel. At the same time, special units have also arrived in these places, carrying many small motorboats that can carry three or four soldiers. Among them are also larger ones that can accommodate two motorcycles, four soldiers, and two machine guns. In addition, there are also reports of troop movements in many places in Germany. A large number of aircraft are concentrated at the junction of the Belgian, Dutch, and German borders. (Fourteenth, Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>London: After the regular leave of officers and soldiers of the British Expeditionary Force was temporarily canceled, those in charge here refused to comment, but private individuals believed that the governments of Belgium and the Netherlands had been taking various military precautions in recent days.

<p>Berlin: The message released by British radio stations, saying that British aircraft recently flew over German airspace, reaching the southeastern and Plessburg airspace of that country, and did not encounter fire from German aircraft and anti-aircraft guns, will make people around the world question Germany's air defense construction. But what can reassure people around the world is that the German people are not asleep. Not only have British aircraft never invaded German airspace, but Germany has air defense surveillance posts in Vienna and Prague, reporting the movement of enemy aircraft at any time. Therefore, it is impossible for British aircraft to invade German territory at night or at the highest altitude. Moreover, aircraft flying into enemy countries at the highest altitude at night have little military value and benefit. Conversely, German aircraft often fly to Britain and France during the day for reconnaissance, which can achieve greater military results. (Fifteenth, Haitong News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>New York: Today, according to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, 18 members of an organization called the Christian Front have been arrested for conspiring to incite a revolution in the United States, overthrow the government, and establish a dictatorship. A small-scale arsenal was seized in New York City, which was said to have been intended for use in the revolution by the Christian Front. The arrested people were all using the operation of sports clubs as a disguise, planning to start using terrorist means to eliminate all Jews from January 20, seize various public utilities, and plan to bomb the "Forward" newspaper office, seize the New York Customs, various Federal Reserve Banks, and the National Guard. Hoover continued, the leader of the organization, Cassel, was also among those arrested, and his followers all called him the leader. Federal detectives, after several searches, seized bombs, rifles, and thousands of rounds of ammunition. It is heard that this conspiracy has been going on for at least seven months. The authorities are now continuing their investigation to seize the Christian Front's hidden weapons elsewhere. According to Hoover, he announced this conspiracy at the request of Attorney General Murphy. Those involved had been meeting in the homes of various party members, at least one of whom was a member of the German-American Bund. There are also many party members who are related to the American Reserve. It is heard that among those arrested, seven people have Irish surnames. The Christian Front has thousands of members, but its exact number cannot be announced until the full Taoist investigation is completed. Hoover also stated that a thorough investigation is underway.

<p>Sydney: It is now known here that in order to realize the British Empire Air Force Plan, Australia will begin large-scale recruitment at the beginning of this year to recruit tens of thousands of Australian Air Force personnel. In addition to the 26,000 flight personnel needed, dozens of technicians are also needed to undertake ground work. Almost all Australian machinists will be absorbed, and the Australian government will also appeal to Australian aviation experts to assist in making up for the inadequacy of the training team provided by Britain. According to the British Empire Air Force Plan, Australia will need more than 2,000 new aircraft to train air force personnel. It is expected that large-scale training will begin in March, and a special department for handling training will be established as soon as possible. This plan is presided over by the Australian Aviation Bureau. Although the Australian government has decided to establish 34 new aviation schools as soon as possible, it is expected that several new schools cannot be completed in a few months.

<h3 id="e33">Results of Japan's Budget Expansion: Inflation Inevitable; Banknote Circulation Far Exceeds Limit <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo—The Japanese government authorities, having endeavored to limit banknote issuance over the past several months, have recently announced officially that the total amount of banknotes in circulation nationwide reached a staggering 3,817,752,000 yen by the end of last year. This surge in currency, while partly attributed to year-end settlements in various sectors, is expected to gradually decrease after the New Year. However, it has already drawn serious attention from the authorities.</p>
<p>The Governor of the Bank of Japan, Toyotaro Kageyama, in his New Year's address, reviewed the state of Japanese finance and frankly warned the government and the people that "the red signal of inflation" had already been triggered. Financial circles indicate that the banknote circulation at the end of last year increased by approximately 1 billion yen compared to the end of the previous year. The government's measures to prevent excessive banknote issuance over the past year have not been particularly effective.</p>
<p>According to the Bank of Japan Act, the bank may issue banknotes backed by coins, gold bullion, silver bars, government bonds, and other reliable commercial paper. However, the total amount is subject to limitations. This limit has been relaxed repeatedly, most recently to 2.7 billion yen. Although the bank, with the consent of the Minister of Finance, may exceed the legal limit, it is required to pay a special tax of 3% on the excess amount to the government.</p>
<p>In practice, the 2.7 billion yen limit was set in October last year, but by then the amount of banknotes in circulation had already exceeded the limit. Therefore, the special tax collection measure had already been implemented. However, the trend of increasing banknote issuance has not been curbed as a result, and the circulation amount has now exceeded the limit by more than 1.1 billion yen. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan's gold reserves are only 500 million yen.</p>
<p>Looking at the state of Japanese currency over the past two and a half years, during the first ten months of the Sino-Japanese War, the bank's banknote issuance was only 100 million yen, which was in line with the legal limit at the time—less than half of the current legal limit. The circulation amount was also less than one-third of the current amount. By April of the previous year, Japan was beginning to feel the impact of the war on its currency, and the bank abruptly raised the issuance limit to 1.7 billion yen. Unexpectedly, four months later, the amount of banknotes in circulation had already increased to 2 billion yen. The Japanese government, left with no choice, again raised the legal limit to 2.2 billion yen in November of the previous year. However, by December of that year, the circulation amount had increased to 2.858 billion yen, breaking the record of 2.659 billion yen from the financial panic of 1927.</p>
<p>In July of last year, the banknote issuance amount decreased briefly, but only temporarily. The government then raised the legal limit to 2.7 billion yen in October. Financial authorities felt that they could at best mitigate the trend of increasing banknote issuance, but could not stop it. This situation has deep-rooted causes that cannot be reversed by government restrictions.</p>
<p>Overly optimistic newspapers in Japan often claim that "economic recovery" is the main reason for the increased currency issuance. They cite various other reasons to justify the current situation, such as the increase in wartime pensions, the surge in demand for funds among silk merchants after the soaring silk prices, the new rice crop entering the market, the growing trend of individuals using cash transactions instead of checks, the rise in prices and wages, and the failure of funds flowing into rural areas to return to urban areas.</p>
<p>However, according to Japanese financial circles, all these reasons are merely different facets of one major factor: the excessively large national budget, which has exceeded 10 billion yen. The state of Japanese banknote circulation is like a lake, with its water level determined by the flow of two rivers. One river pours banknotes into the lake, and the other drains banknotes out of the lake. The former represents the huge expenditures caused by the war in China and the various expenses used to increase production and strengthen military equipment. The latter represents the sources of funds for these expenditures—raising taxes to return a portion of the banknotes in the hands of the people to the national treasury, in other words, withdrawing a portion of the banknotes circulating in the market. This is one method of government fundraising. Requiring banks to subscribe to government bonds to absorb a portion of the funds from all public or semi-public reserves is a second method of fundraising. Therefore, the government can recover a portion of the banknotes from the banks, while the banks, encouraged by the government, transfer the government bonds they have subscribed to private individuals and private industrial and commercial organizations.</p>
<p>In normal times, the interaction of these two rivers can often maintain a relatively stable water level in the lake. However, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the "inflowing river" has become increasingly rapid, leading to a daily increase in banknote issuance, while the "outflowing river" has been extremely slow, reducing the rate at which banknotes flow back from the market to the national treasury. In response to this situation, the government cannot raise tax rates indefinitely, so it can only rely on government bonds to fund the war effort. However, the market is already saturated with previously issued government bonds, and the banks find it increasingly difficult to transfer government bonds to the public. Therefore, even if the government issues new government bonds, the subscription amount is minimal, and these government bonds remain mostly stored in the vaults of banks or organizations. The currency circulating in the market remains banknotes. As a result, the amount of banknotes in circulation will inevitably rise gradually, just as the water level in a lake rises when more water flows in than flows out. The inevitable consequence of this phenomenon is a rise in prices, and the rise in prices then leads to an increase in the amount of banknotes in circulation. This cycle of cause and effect makes inflation inevitable. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>Rice Industry Association Disciplinary Meeting</p>
<p>Ren Da Shun, Sun Meng Ji, and Zhi He are suspected of exceeding price limits in their rice transactions; Qin Yi is suspected of intending to raise prices beyond the limits. The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association held a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees on the 12th of this month and decided that Ren Da Shun was indeed suspected of exceeding price limits and should be fined 100 yuan in accordance with the resolution of the joint meeting of rice industry organizations on May 5, 1928. Regarding Sun Meng Ji and Zhi He, a joint meeting of rice industry organizations should be convened to handle the matter. Regarding Qin Yi, its intention to raise prices beyond the limits is suspected of disrupting the market. In addition to being sent to court by the police, the association should impose a suspension of business for two months. For the sake of prudence, the association convened a joint meeting of seven rice industry organizations at 3 PM yesterday at 15 Avenue Edward VII. A total of 16 representatives, including Chen Ziyi, Xing Zhigang, Zhang Nianxuan, and Fu Qian Geng, attended. Chairman Xing Zhigang presided over the meeting, which resolved to fine Ren Da Shun, Sun Meng Ji, and Zhi He 100 yuan each in accordance with the resolution of the joint meeting of rice industry organizations on May 5 of the previous year, with 30% of the fines going to the whistleblower and 70% allocated to charity expenses. A public announcement was made to the market as a warning. The meeting adjourned at 6 PM.</p>
<p>Charity Bread Distribution Already Difficult</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Association began distributing bread and soup in the evenings to relieve the poor and hungry, it has provided great benefits. However, the number of people has been increasing daily. Despite the increase in the quantity of bread, there are still crowds and insufficient distribution each time. The amount of flour has been increased to 20-30 bags each time, but it is still not enough. If this continues, it will be difficult to sustain the effort. Those involved in charitable work are deeply concerned that the good deed may not be completed, which is also a source of heartache for members of charity organizations. Therefore, while the evening distribution of bread continues as usual, the handling of the matter has become difficult. If there is no financial support, there will eventually be a day when it is suspended halfway. Therefore, there is an urgent need for donations. Regarding the order at the New Great World Road charity distribution site, the Charity Joint Association has specially stipulated that women and children will be given priority for steamed buns, and then other poor people will be given them after the women and children are finished. This can reduce congestion and show compassion for the weak.</p>
<p>Relief for the Underprivileged Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>Relief for the underprivileged is originally a good deed, but there are too many people waiting for assistance. Requests for relief from the association have been overwhelming and far exceed the association's relief funds. Unless new donations are received, the current amount is a drop in the bucket for the underprivileged. Therefore, it is planned to temporarily suspend new requests and first complete the processing of existing requests. If there are future donations, relief efforts will continue, so that the underprivileged will not wait in vain.</p>

<p>The National Comforting Society sent a telegram saying: (Titles omitted) The Lunar New Year is approaching. During this time, there is a lot of unnecessary consumption in society. In view of this, our society is launching a nationwide Spring Festival Military Appreciation Campaign on February 10 (the second day of the Lunar New Year) to save unnecessary consumption, shift the target of gifts, and strengthen anti-Japanese sentiments. However, this matter is significant and requires collective effort to be effective. It is hoped that you will enthusiastically advocate and make efforts to achieve satisfactory results. The future of the war of resistance depends on it. The General Association of the National Committee for Comforting the Resistance Soldiers bows respectfully. It is heard that various sectors in our city greatly support this movement initiated by the Comforting Society. They are now gathering to discuss and promote methods and have scheduled February 10 for expanded promotion. It is hoped that all citizens of the city will rise up and contribute enthusiastically. All donations can be sent directly to the National Bank for collection and remittance.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Bloodshed at the New Stage Last Night; Yu Yefeng Dies from Gunshot Wounds; Two Bullets in Vital Areas, Unable to Save; New Stage Employee Zhang Xuebing Also Injured <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>At 8:45 PM last night, the regular evening drama began on the upper floor of the New Stage on Niuzhuang Road in the Public Concession. As patrons of the opera flocked to the scene, a shooting occurred. The victim was Yu Yefeng from Zhejiang, who was shot twice. He died from his injuries at Renji Hospital. A stray bullet injured Zhang Xuebing, a local employee. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Avid Drama Enthusiast Residing in Shanghai</p>
<p>Yu Yefeng was from Hangzhou, 61 years old. In the early years of the Republic, he served as the commander of the Jiaxing Water Police, but resigned shortly after and came to Shanghai as a retiree. He loved Peking opera, so he was friendly with famous performers from the north and south. He sometimes wrote entertainment articles to pass the time. Because he had lived in Shanghai for many years, he was well-known in various circles. In recent years, he invested in the Linji Lumber Company on Avenue Edward VII. He also served as the manager of the Great Wall Record Company. His friend, Wang Dazhang, is currently the manager of the New Stage. Because Yu loved Peking opera and the New Stage relied on Yu's help to hire famous performers from Beijing and Tianjin, he frequented the stage.</p>
<p>Gunshots Unheard While Enjoying Opera at the Stage</p>
<p>At around 8 PM last night, Yu Yefeng came to see the newly hired female Peking opera performer Xin Yanqiu from the New Stage. Opera fans gathered, and Yu went with delight. The scene outside was bustling. Just as the stage lights shone brightly and the gongs and drums resounded, the stage was performing the play "Snowy Night, Mistaken Journey to Xiaoshang River, Yang Zaixing's Return to Heaven" when gunshots suddenly rang out.</p>
<p>Yu Shot Twice in Vital Areas</p>
<p>Yu's seat was at the entrance of the manager's office on the second floor. At that time, he was focused on the stage when gunshots suddenly rang out from behind. The bullets were like a string of pearls. Yu was shot in the chest and left shoulder. Zhang Xuebing, a stage employee nearby, was also hit in the right leg by a stray bullet. The audience was initially unaware of what was happening until Yu and Zhang were shot and bleeding, causing a commotion. The stage management immediately reported to the police, who dispatched detectives to the scene and sent Yu and Zhang to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Unable to Save, Dies from Injuries</p>
<p>Yu was in his sixties and in poor health. After arriving at the hospital, despite emergency treatment, he fell into a coma because the bullets had hit vital areas. His concubine and Yu Yunjiu and others rushed to the hospital after hearing the news. Yu was unable to speak. He died at 9:55 PM. After reporting to the court for an examination, the body will be prepared for burial.</p>
<p>Audience Shocked, New Performer Stops Performing</p>
<p>After the incident, the opera-loving patrons had come with joy, originally intending to listen to the famous play "Hong Fu Zhuan" by the long-absent Xin Yanqiu. However, due to the sudden incident, the performance was stopped for precautionary reasons, causing the audience to return home disappointed. After arriving at the stage, the police detectives searched everywhere, but the assassin had already fled into the crowd.</p>
<p>Escaped Danger One Year Ago</p>
<p>Yu resided at 10 Yian Lane, 500 Avenue Albert, French Concession, and owned a car. He left behind a son named Yunjiu, who studied in Tokyo and is now the vice-principal of Hongyi Middle School on Gordon Road, Jing'an Temple Road. Yu Yunjiu was also present at the time of the incident. Yu was also present at the shooting at the New New Hotel, Room 407 on June 24, 1927, but luckily escaped unharmed. This time he was shot again, about a year and a half after the last incident.</p>

The Consul-General's family will travel with him. All senior officials and associates of the British Consulate-General in Shanghai, as well as close friends and relatives, held a grand farewell party at the Jianghai Customs Wharf at 10:10 AM yesterday because the Consul-General would not return to Shanghai after returning to England.</p>
<p>To Console Departing Thoughts</p>
<p>Consuls from various countries in Shanghai, including the American Consul Gauss, the French Consul Bausset, the Japanese Consul Iura, the British military attaché Simmons, Rear Admiral Mohler of the US Fourth Marine Regiment, Sir George, the new British Consul-General in Shanghai, as well as Italian, Japanese, and military attachés and diplomatic personnel, along with Consul-General's friends, attended the farewell party. The Jianghai Customs Wharf and the Huangpu Bund were crowded with cars parked end to end. All the soldiers of the British Seaforth Highlanders were mobilized and formed a protective line along the Huangpu River. The police department also sent Chinese and Western detectives to patrol. The Consul-General expressed his deep gratitude to the diplomatic personnel and friends from various countries who came to see him off.</p>
<p>Deep Gratitude</p>
<p>The President Coolidge arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 5 PM on its return trip from Manila. It is scheduled to set sail at 11:45 AM today, taking the route to Kobe via Honolulu, Guam, and San Francisco to the United States. The Consul-General and his wife will stay in the United States for a while and then return to their hometown. After reporting for duty, they will retire.

<p>Warm Situation Recorded by Western Newspapers</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury stated that Sir Fessenden, the British Consul-General, has retired and left Shanghai this (15th) afternoon. Many senior British and other foreign diplomatic, military, and civilian officials went to the Customs Wharf to bid farewell. Sir Fessenden arrived at the Customs Wharf at around 12 noon, inspected the British honor guard, and then shook hands with the French Consul-General Bausset, the American Consul-General Gauss, and British diplomats to say goodbye before boarding a ferry of the American President Lines to transfer to the President Coolidge. Sir Fessenden has served in China for 42 years. The successor as the British Consul-General is Mr. George, who previously served as the Commercial Counsellor of the British Embassy. He also attended the farewell party this afternoon.</p>

<p>The Continental Daily News reported that rumors in the city recently stated that Chen Gongbo, Gao Zongwu, and Tao Xisheng disagreed with Wang Jingwei's political views and left for Hong Kong. A certain news agency strongly denied this information yesterday, calling it pure fabrication.</p>

<p>Regarding the opening of the Yangzi River, the Japanese have been promoting it for a long time, but it has not yet been implemented. All foreign shipping companies in the city intend to participate in preparation to recover their lost profits if the Japanese can sincerely open the Yangtze River, which has been blockaded for more than two years. Therefore, the shipping industry is closely watching this issue. Some foreign ships have begun all preparatory procedures and are constantly inquiring about the official opening date. According to sources in the shipping industry, the Japanese themselves have recently been actively working on navigation plans after the opening of the Yangtze River. Therefore, it is expected that the opening may be implemented, but the saying that the opening will occur on the date reported by the Japanese may not be accurate. It is expected that the opening will be postponed to March 1. Although outsiders have negotiated with the Japanese several times about the opening locations, the Japanese have always insisted on opening only to Nanjing.</p>

<h3 id="e41">Approaching the Anniversary of the "January 28th" Incident: Japanese Troops in the Outskirts in Panic; Chinese Forces Active Along Both Lines; Japanese Authorities Implement Preparations in Advance <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Various circles in Shanghai regard January 28th of this month as the ninth anniversary of the first battle of Shanghai during the Songhu War of Resistance. At present, the full-scale War of Resistance is actively progressing, and military advances are being made on all fronts. Millions of soldiers are fighting fiercely to defend the homeland and strive for victory. On this commemorative day, it is even more inspiring and motivating. In order to commemorate the martyrs of the War of Resistance and the compatriots who died, it has been decided to solemnly mourn on this day, and to implement wartime frugality and promote savings to show the determination of the people in the rear to maintain national policies. The Japanese troops stationed in Shanghai and its suburbs, with the anniversary of the January 28th Shanghai Battle approaching, and at a time when the Japanese troops on the front lines are suffering defeats and Chinese guerrilla forces are extremely active along both lines, are deeply fearful that the Chinese army will take the opportunity to launch an attack. Therefore, the situation is even more alarming. It is reported that the Japanese authorities have decided to implement preparations starting from the 25th of this month. All areas such as Nanshi, Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, and Fengxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha in Pudong will increase the number of Japanese and puppet police sentries to strictly prevent and intensify inspections.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Post Offices Accepting Japanese Currency Are Merely Empty Gestures; The Public Does Not Use Them <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration has been accepting Japanese currency or Japanese military scrip for the purchase of stamps since yesterday. However, according to a reporter from the Datong News Agency who visited the post office yesterday, the public did not use Japanese currency in the post office. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Public Refuses to Use Japanese Currency: The Director of the Shanghai Postal Administration, Zha Pei, and the Deputy Postal Director, the Japanese Jin Zhi Jin Ichiro, unilaterally agreed with the Japanese side that the public could purchase stamps with Japanese currency or Japanese military scrip, and stipulated a conversion rate. Yesterday was the first day of actual acceptance. A reporter from the Datong News Agency made a special trip to the business office on the second floor of the Postal Administration and various branches in the city. The public was deeply aware of the righteousness and has not been found to use Japanese currency or Japanese military scrip at the post office.</p>
<p>The Head Office Will Issue a Severe Reprimand: Furthermore, according to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, the Ministry of Transportation in Chongqing and the Postal Administration in Kunming are unaware of this measure taken by the Shanghai Post Office. Therefore, after the news is published, a telegram of reprimand will be sent within a few days. In addition, all post offices in the occupied areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and the four suburbs of Shanghai will uniformly implement the above-mentioned method of accepting Japanese currency and military scrip starting yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Five Hundred Hot Water Shops Sell at Original Prices <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>After holding an emergency meeting the night before last, the Shanghai Hot Water Industry Association, all members of the industry were deeply aware of the righteousness. Because a price increase would affect the livelihoods of ordinary people throughout the city, they unanimously passed a resolution not to raise prices again. Starting yesterday, they decided to sell at the original prices: (1) One cent for two ladles; (2) One dime for twenty pieces [of firewood]; (3) One yuan for two hundred pieces. There are more than 500 members of the industry in total, and they all abide by the association's resolution. According to Zhang Delong, Chairman of the Association, Shi Xingli, Supervisor, Chen Yishan, Honorary Chairman, and Wang Zhijian, representative, to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, the industry has suffered a great deal due to the soaring price of coal. Some businesses have voluntarily temporarily suspended operations. The fundamental solution is to dredge the source of coal and reduce the price of coal to alleviate the burden on the industry. The industry has decided to appeal to society for sympathy and assistance, and plans to send letters to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession, and the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation today to actively conduct group purchases of coal. On the one hand, they will negotiate with the Kailuan Mining Company to sell coal to the industry at the ex-mine price. At present, all sectors of society have expressed deep admiration for the industry's unanimous opposition to another price increase and will provide assistance within their capabilities. The union will crack down on the few hot water shops that sell each ladle for 20 cash [wen] according to the price increase method.</p>

<p>According to a report in the Continental Daily, a telegram from Xiamen on the 14th from the Tongmeng News Agency stated that Huang Lianzhong, a member of the Xiamen Special Municipal Government and Chairman of the Xiamen Overseas Chinese Federation, and Long Peiying, a former Fujian representative to the National Assembly, were ambushed by terrorists on the 8th of this month while walking near the Customs Club in the Gulangyu Public Concession. Huang</p>
<p>was shot four times and died from his serious injuries at 10:50 a.m. on the 14th at the age of 57. Long was also injured and is now gradually recovering. The Gulangyu Public Concession is making every effort to search, but the murderer is still nowhere to be found. After this case occurred, the Japanese naval authorities immediately tightened restrictions on traffic between Gulangyu and the mainland to prevent</p>
<p>the murderer from escaping. On the 9th of this month, the Japanese Consul-General in Xiamen, Uchida, requested that the Director-General of the Public Concession, Hickling, search for the murderer, and claimed that this shooting incident was another case of anti-Japanese terrorism. Hickling assured Uchida that he would take all steps to arrest the criminal, and a reward of 250 yuan has now been offered for the arrest of the murderer.</p>

<p>Wuzhou Detective Agency detectives Qiu Haitao, Gao Wenbing, Wang Qi'an, Qian Yongchang, Leng Zhenzhang, and others, together with French detective Ma Ying (transliteration), went to 408 Wang Ju Road at 9:00 a.m. on the 23rd of last month. Under the pretext of searching for prohibited drugs, they extorted 600 yuan in national currency from Du Shaoru, a merchant from Chongming. Du reported this to the French Police Department, which sent detectives to arrest them. Three pairs of handcuffs and 600 yuan in banknotes were seized. Except for the Frenchman Ma Ying, who was sent to the French Consulate for interrogation, the remaining defendants were interrogated and detained by Judge Sun of the Second Special Court for investigation. Details have been published in the newspapers. Judge Sun continued the hearing of the case in the first criminal court yesterday afternoon. The police department charged Qiu Haitao and others with crimes such as intimidation and extortion, obstruction of freedom, and disturbing order. According to the confessions of the defendants Gao Wenbing and Qiu Haitao, they did not know who wrote the report on Du Shaoru's drug trafficking, and Detective Ma Ying did not tell them. Ma Ying took them with handcuffs to arrest Du that morning when they went to work. They did not know how much money the victim paid Ma Ying. After verifying the confessions in court and briefly questioning the other three defendants, the court ordered that the case be adjourned to January 29 to wait for Ma Ying to be brought to court for confrontation.</p>

<p>Pan Wenran, a native of Nanhui who resides at No. 22, Delun Lane, Weimar Road, French Concession, is 28 years old this year. He is a shareholder of Maofeng and other three cotton shops in Yongning Lane, Henan Road. His family is well-off. He married Zhang, a fellow villager (23 years old this year, currently residing at No. 113, Vegetable Market Street), as his wife. Because Pan is ugly, he often seeks pleasure outside. After the August 13th Incident, Zhang returned to her hometown, and Pan openly became involved with Deng Lijuan (20 years old this year), a woman from Suzhou, and lived together. They have already had a son. However, because Pan did not care about her life, Zhang came to Shanghai from her hometown to look for Pan and learned that Pan had a new love and had long abandoned his wife. She was furious and reported adultery at 6:00 a.m. on the 8th of this month. Pan and Deng were arrested together at No. 22, Delun Lane, Weimar Road, and taken to the police station, then sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court for trial. After questioning by Judge Qiu Huan, the two defendants were ordered to pay 500 yuan each as security to be released and to try to reconcile. Details were reported in the newspapers. Yesterday morning was the date for the continued trial. According to the plaintiff, during the adjournment, Lawyer Xu Wufang had come forward to reconcile. The content of the reconciliation was that the defendant would pay 600 yuan in alimony and allow the two parties to divorce. Therefore, she withdrew the lawsuit. After verifying the statement in court, the court ordered that the case be dismissed.</p>

At 6:30 p.m. on December 22nd of last year, the girl went to Linqing Road to visit relatives. She was teased and stalked by Chen Wenlong (21 years old), a fellow villager, on the way. She was induced to go to a barbershop in a certain hotel on Taopeng Road, and then stayed with his brother at No. 83, Renshou Lane, Beikai Road for three days. Later, she rented a pavilion upstairs at No. 163 of the same lane and lived together as husband and wife. After living there for seven days, because no one was taking care of her, she took the girl to her sister's house. It was New Year's Day of this year. Her sister learned the truth from the girl and thought it was inappropriate, so she sent Long back to her father Long Jinfu's house at No. 108, Haizhou Road. From then on, she did not allow the girl to go out to work in a certain yarn factory. Unexpectedly, Chen Wenlong's heart for Long did not die, and he still hoped that she would continue to live with him. That's why he lurked near Long's house at noon the other day, intending to see Wang Ying and then try to induce her to come out again. He was spotted by the girl's father, Long Jinfu, who bit off Chen's left thumb in an attempt to escape. The guard on duty heard the alarm and took him to the Yangshupu Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. After questioning by Judge Jiang Shuzi, Chen Wenlong was sentenced to six months in prison as a warning.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Suggestions for Suppressing Rice Prices: Legal and Administrative Measures Should Be Taken Simultaneously; Authorities and Residents Should Work Together <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>(Continued) (2) Severe Legal Sanctions: A legitimate merchant who trades to make a small profit, no one can curse him. But a group of rice worms; or those who were not rice worms originally, saw money and became greedy, took advantage of the opportunity, and even against their conscience, monopolized and manipulated the people's only rice, raising prices to an unprecedented level. If these people are not severely punished by law, they will disrupt society on a small scale and endanger the country on a large scale. The harm is truly unimaginable. Article 12 of the Regulations on the Administration of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce During the Extraordinary Period stipulates that "designated enterprises and goods, their producers and operators, shall not engage in speculation, monopoly, or other manipulative behavior." Then food is one of the designated goods, as stipulated in Article 1, Paragraph 3 of the same regulations, and of course, it must not be monopolized or manipulated. If greed blinds their wisdom and violates the regulations, it is a criminal act. According to Article 31 of the same regulations, they shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than five years and fined one to three times the amount of the proceeds. Not only should those who engage in monopoly and manipulation be criminally punished, but even the amount of sales of food between rice shops in the same industry, if it exceeds the amount of existing stock, or if it is based on the sale of standard goods and the calculation of profits and losses based on the difference, or if non-industry people mutually trade futures, or if they establish a market similar to an exchange, this kind of intention to speculate and manipulate is also a criminal act, and the same punishment as before will be imposed, regardless of rank. This is stipulated in Article 13 of the Measures for Determining Prices and Eliminating Speculation and Manipulation During the Extraordinary Period. Both laws have been promulgated, and the Shanghai Special District Court should apply them. Mr. Jiang Liquan, a judge of the Second Special District Court of Shanghai, has already expressed his opinion that it can be applied in accordance with Article 2 of the Agreement on the Chinese Court in the Shanghai Public Concession and Article 3 of the Agreement on the Establishment of the Chinese Court in the Shanghai French Concession. Why should we hide them and not expose them as much as possible?</p>
<p>(3) Find ways to dredge the source: The rice-producing areas actually have a surplus of rice; however, the transportation to Shanghai is blocked by special forces, and neither land nor water transportation is possible. Things are valued when they are scarce. It can be seen that the rise in the price of national rice is not only due to rice worms hoarding and speculating, but also to other reasons. Rice worm profiteers are taking advantage of the opportunity. The authorities of the two concessions are commendable for their good intentions in safeguarding the people's livelihood within the concessions and restricting selling prices! However, on the one hand, it is also necessary to do everything possible to negotiate with the special forces to allow rice to be freely imported; if this cannot be done, residents will forever eat rice at 40 yuan a "dan". I am afraid that the prosperity of Shanghai will turn into a past relic and cannot be maintained. With such expensive rice, all kinds of goods will be affected and rise day by day. May I ask the wage-earning class, who earn 30 to 40 yuan a month, find it insufficient to buy rice. Those who are cunning will become thieves, and those who are cautious will be forced to go to the interior. This is a natural trend that can be imagined. By that time, I don't know how the prosperity within the concession will be maintained.</p>
<p>The first and third points mentioned above are about administrative aspects, and the second point is about legal aspects. They should be implemented simultaneously, and the concession authorities and residents should work together. Not only can rice prices be suppressed, but also various commodity prices will be affected to a considerable extent.</p>

<p>Flour was firm and strong yesterday, and the price of No. 2 flour factory remained at 9.8 yuan, and no further increase was made for the time being. However, customer quotations were still not open, because the raw materials for flour milling are becoming increasingly expensive. The opening price of domestic wheat reached a peak of 18 yuan, which is unprecedented. It is reported that the price of returned goods from the "Car and Ship" brand was 10.023 yuan, but there was still a lack of supply. The price of imported flour also rose, and "Foreign Fortress," "Battleship," and "Double Eagle" brands all required 10.056 yuan. Customers made some purchases. The futures trading of "Phoenix" brand flour from Japanese factories disappeared after a dispute a few days ago. It is reported that the price for January was 10.025 yuan, and the spot price was 10.01 yuan.</p>
<p>Wheat prices reached new highs again yesterday, with the opening price of Guan Dian and Suzhou white wheat reaching a peak of 18 yuan, which can be described as the height of its prosperity. At present, the prices of Australian imported wheat are high and there are not many berths, so each factory may not order in large quantities, and domestic wheat stocks are nearly exhausted, so there is a regret that supply is not meeting demand. Therefore, sellers are simply hoarding and the market is becoming increasingly expensive. Yesterday, the market traded three or four trucks of Suzhou Guan wheat, priced at 18 yuan to 17.5 yuan. Fufeng Factory also bought 2,000 bags of Su Xi wheat at 17.2 yuan. Fuxin Factory temporarily did not take in any, it is said.</p>
<p>The price of imported wheat has risen to 24-25 yuan. Factories made three or four telegram orders yesterday, but it is not easy to predict whether the transactions will be successful due to the lack of berth space. The price of domestic wheat is 18 yuan, which is the price paid by oil traders transporting to Gulangyu, so the price is high. The factory flour may need to rise again because the cost has reached 10 yuan.</p>
<p>Regarding flour, 1,000 bags were shipped to Hong Kong yesterday, and 2,000 bags will be shipped to Tianjin today.</p>

<p>Recently, the rice market has been dominated by imported rice, and the sales of thick and thin, japonica and Nanhang early and late rice have become sporadic. Yesterday was still in this state. Since it is not easy to transfer from Hongkou, it is said that 500-600 bags were transferred from Hongkou yesterday. The sales of thin rice have always been sluggish, so the market appeared flat and weak, and it has been cut short by 1-2 jiao. Each thick japonica and early and late rice are mostly constrained, and the transactions are also few. However, since the source is not continued, merchants still find it difficult to sell lightly. The supply and demand of white rice are similar, and there is also a lack of fluctuations. The local goods of Lu Yangjian are extremely scarce, and the sales are greatly affected by imported rice, so there are not many openings, and the prices have not changed much. Only various kinds of imported rice, both local shops and merchants are very interested, and merchants from the inland are still buying smoothly, so the morning situation is still high. Pay attention to old goods, new ones are just like that. Regarding new and old Saigon, each has its own characteristics, and the situation is very different. Old Saigon has been raised by 2-3 jiao, while new goods have been flat all the way. In addition, by noon, those who held new Saigon and Da Wen rice suddenly returned to sell together, so the market color showed a tired state. As a result, it fell by 3-4 jiao compared with the previous one. Da Wen rice was 37 yuan and 36.8 yuan. At the same time, old Saigon was inevitably constrained, and the closing price did not fluctuate much, remaining at 37.5 yuan and 37.23 yuan, which was only firm. Other items such as Tokyo Broken Grain and Siamese Broken Rice all follow Saigon's lead.</p>
<p>A small number of imported rice arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, with 1,000 bags from Haiphong and 400 bags from Hong Kong on the Ewo Shipping Company's Yisheng Wheel. They arrived the day before yesterday (the 14th) and docked at Roosevelt Wharf. Unloading was completed yesterday. Yesterday, the company's Dingsheng Wheel arrived in Shanghai, carrying 9,382 bags of imported rice from Hong Kong, which will be shipped to Tianjin by the original ship this afternoon. (Zu)</p>
<p>In other news, the orders for imported rice were not divided yesterday, and the returned goods were not sold off. The market entrants are also waiting and watching, and with the upcoming price reduction, people's hearts are trending downwards. The total transaction for the day was less than 2,000 bags, and the price was reduced by 2-3 jiao. The prices of Saigon No. 1 and No. 2 are both high, and no agreement has been reached for a long time. Even broken rice has not been ordered continuously. However, Fook Kea Trading Company sold 500 tons of broken rice yesterday due to other reasons, and the price was only 33.55 yuan, it is said.</p>

<p>The soybean oil market opened yesterday, with prices dropping by [Number] yuan compared with the previous market. The opening price for Yan Qi oil was 200 pieces, priced at 75 yuan. The opening price for Qing Qi oil was 100 pieces, priced at 73 yuan. The opening price for Jiaozhou oil was 130 pieces, priced at 70 yuan. The opening price for Changzhou Lai factory oil was 60 barrels, with prices ranging from 99.5 yuan to 98 yuan. At present, under the situation of weak sales, the trend is still less dramatic. The reason is that the large amount of crude oil from Dalian has not been resolved, causing people's hearts to brew uncertainly. I only hope that traders will not willingly be the heads of the insurgents.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 200 bags of soybeans came from Beisha and 700 boxes of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday saw no changes in HSBC's listed prices. Although it was the beginning of the week, the black market for British and American currencies remained relatively stable. Most speculators were cautious and observing. Initially, there was some easing, but this was offset by HSBC's absorption and foreign firms buying in. Towards the afternoon, some speculators and Hong Kong Electric successively sold off, causing renewed easing. The reason for the initial selling by Chinese banks was the news report of the Abe cabinet's collapse in Japan. In the morning, due to the continued rise in British and American exchange rates, there was an initial appearance of stability in the British currency and easing in the US currency. Subsequently, due to Chinese banks dumping and Japanese banks (Yokohama Specie Bank) continuing to sell, even though some American banks were willing to absorb at lower prices, the market felt glutted. The British pound rose to 4 pence, 84375, and the US dollar hardened to 8 yuan, 0625. HSBC then suddenly took the opportunity to absorb, and importers and cotton merchants also followed by buying US dollars for future months in significant amounts. The market stabilized immediately. By the midday close, it was 4 pence, 828125, and 7 yuan, 96875. The afternoon was initially quite stagnant, but after 3 pm, unexpectedly a few speculators liquidated their long positions for January.

The closing prices were 4 pence, 84375, and 8 yuan, 03125, which was a loosening of 03125 and 09375 compared to last Saturday. Futures showed the same trend as spot prices.</p>
<p>Foreign Firms Take Advantage of Low Prices to Buy In</p>

Central Bank's listed prices for various currencies remained the same. Banks' morning opening prices for spot exchange rates were 4 pence, 8125 for British currency and 7 yuan, 96875 for US currency, which was stable for the British currency and a loosening of 03125 for the US currency compared to the previous weekend, due to the continued rise in exchange rates. After opening, Chinese banks began to sell first, followed by the Yokohama Specie Bank, resulting in a hardening of the market. It is estimated that Chinese banks and the Yokohama Specie Bank sold spot US dollars to foreign banks at 8 yuan and 8 yuan, 03125. At that time, spot British currency could be settled at 4 pence, 828125. HSBC's listed prices were announced as unchanged. The announcement of the Bank of China's equalization tax also showed no rise or fall. Afterwards, Chinese banks continued to dump, further easing the market. It is estimated that Chinese banks sold spot US dollars to Favorite Bank and another bank at 8 yuan, 0625. Simultaneously, foreign banks conducted spot British currency transactions among themselves at 4 pence, 84375. Then, the British Bank and HSBC suddenly became interested in buying, absorbing spot US dollars from their counterparts at 8 yuan, 03125, which stabilized the situation. Later, foreign firms took advantage of the low prices to buy in. Simultaneously, Chinese cotton yarn merchants also bought in for future months, causing the market to stabilize immediately. It is estimated that foreign firms bought US dollars for February at 7 yuan, 9375, and US dollars for this month at 8 yuan. Subsequently, cotton yarn merchants also purchased US dollars for February at 7 yuan, 90625 and 875. At that time, spot prices softened to 4 pence, 828125, and 7 yuan, 96875. Afterwards, trading decreased, and the situation became very stagnant. Until the close, banks' selling prices for spot exchange rates remained at 4 pence, 828125 for British currency and 7 yuan, 96875 for US currency, which was a loosening of 015625 for the British currency compared to the morning opening, and stable for the US currency.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Market Also Sells Off in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The afternoon market was initially quite stagnant. Around 2 pm, speculators first dumped US dollars for this month to foreign firms at 8 yuan. Shortly after, Hong Kong Electric also dumped spot British currency to foreign firms at 4 pence, 84375, and spot US dollars at 8 yuan, 03125. At that time, Chase Bank and another bank also dumped spot US dollars to importers at 8 yuan, resulting in a renewed hardening of the process. Until the evening close, banks' selling prices for spot exchange rates were 4 pence, 84375 for British currency and 8 yuan, 03125 for US currency. British currency for this month was 4 pence, 828125, and US currency was 8 yuan. British currency for the next month was 4 pence, 765625, and US currency was 7 yuan, 875.

<h3 id="e65">Foreign Exchange Trends Lower, Gold Prices Fall Slightly <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold bar black market situation increasingly felt listless. The situation did not leave the realm of hovering. In general, speculators, in light of the poor environment and the weakening foreign exchange market, which was unfavorable to long positions, showed little excitement for buying gold. However, most large long holders did not release their holdings. Only a certain securities firm slightly came out to sell, so the price decline was still slow. Initially, the price fell 13 yuan upon the foreign exchange market's reported loosening, to 4,065 yuan. As the foreign exchange rate continued to harden, the securities firm dumped again, pressing the price down by 3 yuan. Subsequently, as the foreign exchange market stabilized and a certain money exchange firm bought in, the price twice returned to a high of 4,073 yuan. Then, due to gold shops and a certain bank competing to sell, and the buyers being weak, the price fell downward again. By the midday close, it was only 4,068 yuan. Afternoon trading was stagnant, and the fluctuations were not large. Finally, due to the securities firm continuing to sell, the price fell slightly by another 2 yuan, to 4,066 yuan, which was another continuous fall of 12 yuan compared to last Saturday. The total daily trading volume was estimated to be around 700 taels. Jewelry gold shops and customs orders remained flat.</p>
<p>Gold Bar Falls 12 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (10 taels) initially fell 13 yuan compared to last Saturday, to 4,065 yuan, because of news reports that were bad and the hardening of the foreign exchange market. For a moment another gold shop bought 30 taels on behalf of a customer, raising the price back up by 3 yuan, to 4,068 yuan. Then, because the securities firm sold again, and at the same time a certain bank liquidated their floating long positions, the price fell again. The securities firm sold 20 taels to the money exchange firm at 4,062 yuan. After this, the foreign exchange market stabilized, and the money exchange firm's appetite for gold was quite strong, so the price rose again. The money exchange firms conducted 20 taels of business between themselves at 4,073 yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop took the opportunity to sell again, and jewelry shops also dumped, so the price fell back to 4,065 yuan. Then, as the foreign exchange rate stabilized, a certain securities firm bought in at the low price, raising the price back up to 4,073 yuan. But because the gold shop sold again, and a certain bank also came out to sell on behalf of their customers, the price fell again. The gold shop sold 20 taels to the securities firm at 4,067 yuan. Then, a certain jewelry shop sold 20 taels to the bank at 4,068 yuan as the midday closing price. At the initial opening of the afternoon market, the price rose by 1 yuan. The money exchange firm bought 10 taels from the jewelry shop at 4,069 yuan. Later, the securities firm dumped dozens of taels, falling slightly by 4 yuan. The securities firm sold 10 taels to the money exchange firm at 4,065 yuan. Afterwards, the gold shop bought in, raising the price by 3 yuan. The customs order firm bought 10 taels from the money exchange firm at 4,068 yuan. Finally, the securities firm sold again, lowering the price again by one yuan. The securities firm sold 20 taels to the jewelry shop at 4,066 yuan as the evening closing price, resulting in a drop of 12 yuan compared to the previous weekend. The daily fluctuation was 11 yuan. The selling price of cash gold shops' own brand of gold was a few yuan higher than the gold bar price, while the buying price was reduced by 20 yuan.

<p>Yesterday, due to the changes in the domestic cabinet and the United States again lending large sums to China, and the frequent reports of victories on the front lines, the market was weak. All currencies except Hong Kong notes fell. There was almost no demand for British and American gold pounds, and the prices were weak. There was a large supply of British and American gold notes, and the market prices were soft. In the morning, British order notes fell to 45 yuan, 80 cents, and American gold notes fell to 12 yuan, 55 cents. The intermediate fluctuations were quite dramatic, once falling to 12 yuan, 42 cents. The result was 12 yuan, 45 cents in the evening. The demand for Hong Kong notes was uniquely smooth, and the market prices were strong and expensive. The supply of French francs and Annam notes increased. Singapore and Dutch notes were weak in the market. Canadian notes and Philippine notes followed in the footsteps of American notes, falling rapidly. The supply of Japanese gold notes tended to be high, and they were also weak. The evening market was 1 yuan, 10 cents and 6.2 mils. Korean notes also fell to 1 yuan, 4 cents and 8 mils in the evening market.

<p>Yesterday's exchange draft note discount rate fell sharply and rapidly, with a tendency to be unable to recover.

Around noon, it slightly recovered to 23 yuan and 50 cents. In the afternoon, it could not withstand the pressure again, and finally it was 23 yuan, which was a sharp drop of 2 yuan and 50 cents compared to the previous Saturday midday close.

<p>The securities black market yesterday was superficially characterized by firm delivery prices, but changes were brewing beneath the surface. The reorganization of the domestic cabinet might shorten the Sino-Japanese War, but in reality, the warlords are still in power, so there is no cause for optimism. The rumors of Sino-American loans have not been confirmed, so there are still many changes in the environment. Yesterday's trading was flat, and there was no special demand or supply. Although Jardine Matheson still purchased in the morning, it gradually stopped in the afternoon. Later, due to the strong demand for No. 11, the market price suddenly became firm and attractive. Then, Jardine Matheson, Butterfield &amp; Swire, and Cornabé, Eck &amp; Co. successively sought to sell. Although Da Ching, Dong Tai, Union, and others still had a buying appetite, the selling pressure was stronger, so the market slightly turned tired, fluctuating between 1 and 2 cents. In the afternoon, No. 28 bought E-type bonds, and the rest, such as Jardine Matheson, Butterfield &amp; Swire, Jardine Matheson, and Cornabé, Eck &amp; Co., were slightly absorbed, but the selling trend became stronger, and the trend was already weak. Fortunately, the results were still slightly better, rising by 5 cents, 10 cents, to 20 cents. The total transaction volume was about 600,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 20 shares of Zhejiang Industrial Bank stock were traded at a price of 78 yuan each.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Stock Exchange opened in the morning, and the buying interest in industrial stocks was extremely strong. Shares of International Trust Company, Shanghai Bank Company, and Yangtze Bank Company all reached new highs. Ewo Cotton Spinning &amp; Weaving Co., Ltd. showed a small weakness, once rising to 36 yuan and 50 cents. Then, as profit-taking began, the supply of various stocks rebounded. In the afternoon, due to the activities of large buyers, prices trended upward again. The market at the close was firm and attractive. Rubber stocks were ignored, and the prices were stable, mostly resembling the closing prices of the previous day.</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market, which had turned up at the end of last week, returned to calm yesterday. This was because there were too many 20-count yarn stocks, and the market was flooded, so sentiment was still peaceful. The demand from Hong Kong merchants showed signs of improvement again, but they chose which brands of yarn to buy. The market atmosphere was not affected in any way. In North China, there was a healthier appetite for coarse yarn. Given this situation, the cotton yarn market should be able to consolidate further. What the future holds depends on actual trading.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn: The opening sentiment was still good because people had a good mood from the previous day. There were still many buyers at the opening, but there were also many sellers. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 720 yuan. Then, it was heard that Guangzhou merchants had demand, and the market appeared more expensive, rising to 724 yuan. In the middle, as the foreign exchange rate lengthened, the selling trend rose again. At the same time, there was an excess of Double Horse yarn stocks, which gradually eased, falling to 718 yuan at the close. According to the half-day trading statistics, 2,325 bales were traded. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell 4 yuan, Heavenly Maiden fell 5 yuan, and Double Globe fell 6 yuan. Yesterday, 42 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, and today, 195 pieces were shipped to Tianjin. The quantities of yarn bought by various merchant groups are listed below:</p>
<p>Tianjin: 400, Companion: 1, 200</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 615</p>
<p>Mainland: 10, Ningbo: 40. Total: 2,325</p>

<p>Trading in native cotton has become quiet because the end of the lunar year is approaching, and everyone is preparing to close their accounts to await the coming year before competing again. Therefore, business has entered a state of stagnation. In addition, overseas cotton markets are already in a state of rotation. The sources of Su cotton: Tonghua, 340 bales; Changyinsha, 114 bales; Beisha Lai, 520 bales. The status of current cotton is recorded below.</p>
<p>Another dispatch states that the price of foreign cotton is as follows: New York cotton market: The market was particularly quiet. Yesterday, due to selling by spot merchants and overseas merchants, cotton prices were extremely weak. As a result, closing prices fell 23 points compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market rebounded slightly, rising 2 Rupees along with forecasts. Egyptian cotton fell 80 points. Liverpool had no market.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton imports to Shanghai have failed to develop recently. All firms are about to close their accounts due to the imminent arrival of the end of the year. Factories also have sufficient inventory, and yarn prices are difficult to raise, so they have no intention of purchasing. Transactions by Japanese manufacturers are also very quiet. According to this situation, foreign cotton transactions are unlikely to develop this year. The prices of cotton delivered to factories yesterday, converted using a US dollar exchange rate of 7 yuan, 9375, are as follows:</p>

<p>National Cloth</p>
<p>Cloth prices opened higher yesterday because of the development of domestic and foreign trade and the rise in bleaching, dyeing, and finishing costs. Therefore, the market continued to trend upward. The products of British firms Jardine Matheson and Wheelock Marden, including coarse cloth, fine cloth, twill, printed cloth, and bleached cloth, increased in price by about 50 cents per piece. The increase in prices of products from Chinese factories was relatively moderate, rising by 5 cents to 25 cents per piece. Wholesale stores on this street, fearing that bleaching and dyeing costs would rise further, sent grey cloth to bleaching and dyeing factories early, so transactions in spring goods and grey cloth suddenly increased. Transactions in white goods, fine cloth, twill, coarse cloth, and bleached cloth were close to 200 pieces. Zhejiang and Jiangxi merchants purchased close to 100 pieces of goods from Wheelock Marden and Jardine Matheson. Tianjin merchants purchased over 100 pieces of coarse cloth, coarse twill, and blue cloth. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants purchased over 4,000 pieces of fine twill and colored cloth. Merchants from Fujian and Southeast Asia also continued to sell.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth</p>
<p>The morning opening for white goods was flat. Then, the Tianjin merchants scrambled to purchase Dragon Head fine cloth for spot and forward delivery, and transactions reached about 1,000 pieces, raising the market trend. The forward price for Dragon Head this month rose to 21 yuan, 90 cents, the forward price for this month was 22 yuan and 10 cents, and the forward price for the next month was 22 yuan and 50 cents. The total number of forward contracts for various brands of fine cloth was over 600 pieces. Firms on this street and dyeing factories also purchased close to 1,000 pieces of medium- and low-grade fine cloth, so the market trend turned firm. Fine cloth and fine twill both rose by 10 to 20 cents per piece compared to the previous week.</p>
<p>Exports: Yesterday, 20 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong, and today, 140 pieces were shipped to Tianjin.</p>

For example, a 200-pound box sells for 86 yuan, and a 2,000-pound bundle sells for 900 yuan. Yesterday's market traded over 600 boxes, mostly purchased by local thermos factories, mirror factories, printing factories, and iron can factories.

<p>(Shaoguan Dispatch) The Guangdong Military District Command, in order to popularize the education of the War of Resistance, enable the people to understand their military service obligations, possess a sense of national identity and ethnic consciousness, actively join the army, voluntarily enlist, and strengthen the power of the War of Resistance, has specially drafted measures to promote the education of the War of Resistance. After consulting with the Provincial Department of Education, it has issued orders to all counties to comply with and implement them. According to the main points of the measures, all levels of schools should adopt wartime education courses as much as possible, and fully instill in all students and young people a sense of national identity and ethnic consciousness. During school holidays, teachers and students should organize political work teams and propaganda teams to go deep into the people, publicize the great achievements of the Chinese army's War of Resistance, inspire the public's conscience, and encourage them to join the army enthusiastically.</p>
<h3 id="e95">An Overview of the Promotion of Free Education in China (8) <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>(8) Conclusion</p>
<p>Looking at the above results, the promotion of compulsory education in China has indeed entered the implementation stage from the advocacy stage. Although the achievements of its promotion have only lasted for more than two years, it is still impossible to draw concrete conclusions and evaluations. Although the figures reported by the provinces and cities are not as optimistic as the planned expectations, generally speaking, the results achieved have reached more than half of the planned targets. If the war ends, further detailed reviews are conducted, effective measures are revised, sufficient funds are raised, and administrative institutions are improved, then the plan to increase the number of school-age children to more than 80% may not be impossible to realize. However, judging from past experience and actual circumstances, the most important thing in the process of promoting compulsory education is administration. Whether the implementation of all government orders in China can succeed or not, administrative personnel often account for 70 to 80%, while methods and systems account for only 20 to 30%. Education cannot be an exception. Therefore, the same method may be effective in Province A, but Province B may have resentment and difficulties. The key lies entirely in the transfer of personnel and administrative organization. Guangxi, as a poor and backward province, has been able to establish schools in all townships in four or five years. Although there may be differences in quality, the foundation has been laid, and improvement is easy. Popularization can be achieved as scheduled. Therefore, in the future, in promoting compulsory education, the central government must pay special attention to local administration and personnel issues. The second is the funding problem. In the past, the difficulty of promoting compulsory education in various provinces and cities was concentrated on the funding point. However, if a poor area like Guangxi can establish schools in every township, the funds are all raised locally, and the most important method is to use local public property, collect labor, and use public cultivation methods to use the harvest as a school fund. After a few years, the township can establish a basic national school and obtain permanent funding without having to rely on external assistance. Therefore, in the future, in promoting compulsory education, it is essential to focus on the collection of funds for the establishment of national schools in each township. The third is the method. In the past, the central government's plan to promote compulsory education focused on first establishing one-year short-term primary schools on a large scale, and after a few years, gradually converting them into two-year short-term primary schools and four-year ordinary primary schools. Now that the outline of the county-level organization network has been promulgated, the promotion of compulsory education in the future will be entirely based on establishing a national school in each township and a central primary school in each township (town). The basic unit for establishing primary schools in various places is entirely in the townships and towns, which is not much different from the original unit of the primary school district. The length of schooling in township national schools is set at four years. If due to economic reasons, the length of schooling can be two years as the end of compulsory education, which also corresponds to the original planned two-year short-term primary school. Therefore, if provinces, counties, and cities can delineate the area of the townships as soon as possible and then establish national schools in stages according to the actual situation in various places, the plan for popularization can be achieved as scheduled.

<p>Since the outbreak of the war, academic talents have mostly moved around without a fixed place, losing contact. All affairs of the Chinese Chemical Society have almost completely stalled. In August last year, the first annual meeting in extraordinary times was convened in Kunming. The seventh issue of the journal was recently published in Chengdu and has been received in Shanghai. However, the addresses of members have mostly changed after the war. The General Assembly is eager to make contact and hopes that members will notify Yuan Hanqing of Chongqing Central University of their new mailing addresses at any time for communication and to send publications. As for the association's expenses, it is also extremely lacking due to not collecting membership fees for more than two years. It has now been agreed that the Jing'an Temple Road/Gordon Road branch of the Xinhua Savings Bank will collect fees on behalf of the association in Shanghai to facilitate collection and submission to the General Assembly. Permanent members can also donate as appropriate so that the association's affairs can proceed as usual.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Shanghai educational circles, considering that commodity prices in Shanghai are soaring and that it is necessary to slightly increase tuition fees and improve treatment, have decided through a general discussion to appropriately increase tuition fees and treatment to maintain livelihoods and have notified their members accordingly. Unexpectedly, a dispatch from the Xinhua News Agency in Chongqing on the 14th indicated that there were other motives, which is very surprising. Our association has expressed its views and decided on its own actions based on the opinions of its members, but the news agency's statement is incredible. We are sending this letter to the Shen Bao.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Passive Earthquake Prevention Methods <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Li Shaozhong</p>
<p>Beginning on the morning of December 27, 1939, and continuing for several days, Turkey unfortunately suffered an unprecedented earthquake. According to a recent survey report released by the Turkish government, the death toll in Erzincan alone reached more than 14,000. In other places such as Gasiqi, Yuegate, Simashia, and Tokat, the total number of deaths was about 12,000, and the number of injured was about 4,000. The survivors in the disaster area will be moved to other places, and the earthquake area will become a "no man's land."</p>
<p>Originally, the loss of life and property is an inevitable result of a major earthquake. Often within a few minutes, the loss of life is staggering. For example, 50,000 people died in the Lisbon earthquake in 1755; 180,000 people died in the great earthquake in China in 1920; 200,000 people died in the great earthquake in Japan in 1922; and in the statistical figures we know, the earthquake with the highest number of deaths was the great earthquake in India in 1737, which killed 300,000 people. The above figures are inevitably exaggerated, but the statistics on the deaths and injuries in the great earthquake in Japan in 1923 will not be wrong. In that famous earthquake in Japan, 99,331 people died and 103,733 people were injured (including the number of people who died or were injured in the fire caused by the earthquake).</p>
<p>Until now, we have not been able to directly control the power of earthquakes. But we can try to reduce the destructive power of earthquakes: first, predict the occurrence of earthquakes and prepare to move to a safe place as soon as possible; second, choose the location and form of buildings appropriately to reduce the degree of damage during earthquakes. Research on earthquake prediction is still in its early stages, but considerable progress has been made. As for the appropriate choice of the location of buildings, according to past experience, we know that buildings on solid rock suffer the least damage during earthquakes, followed by houses built on soft soil, and houses on "newly formed" land are the most dangerous, especially on filled ponds or riverbanks. Therefore, in areas with frequent earthquakes, building houses should avoid being near cliffs or riverbanks. In Japan and other countries with frequent earthquakes, great attention has long been paid to the form and structure of buildings. According to the situation during the earthquake in Japan in 1923, brick and stone houses were the most easily damaged, while wooden houses were able to remain standing, but their only drawback is that they easily accelerate the spread of fire. Modern steel and brick houses are quite effective in restraining earthquakes and fires.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Books on the Bus <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Lingyou</p>
<p>We all know that people in the 20th century must constantly increase their knowledge; otherwise, they will not be able to keep up with the times and become outdated, turning into Confucian scholars. We must constantly expand our own world, making it vast and broad, in order to enjoy a rich and interesting life.</p>
<p>But in this bustling city of Shanghai, the solution to the problem of livelihood and the burden of work are enough to hinder us from increasing our knowledge. Most of our knowledge comes from books. How many people can spare an hour a day to read books and improve themselves? But people living in Shanghai rely on vehicles to seek convenience when traveling from east to west and from west to east. Since this is the case, then everyone must spend a considerable amount of time in vehicles every day, so the time on the bus can really be used to read books.</p>
<p>A few years ago, a newspaper reported that an old gentleman in England in his forties read law books on the tram to and from his office every day. After more than ten years, he applied for the judge's exam. Although he was not admitted because his education did not meet the exam requirements, he was ranked at the top of the list in the entire exam and was admitted as an honorary judge. The news spread and became a hot topic. This shows that if the time on the bus is used properly, the achievement is not small. On the other hand, reading on a bumpy bus is harmful to the eyes, so it may be a loss. Therefore, there is a suggestion for "Books on the Bus."</p>
<p>A famous foreign educator named Gulick once suggested compiling "Books on the Bus," which is worth learning from. He believes that the fonts in the "Books on the Bus" should be larger than the fonts in ordinary books, and the spacing between lines should also be wider. As for the content of the books, it should be interesting and avoid the disadvantages of being boring. It is also necessary to cause reflection from reading, so that the eyesight is not used excessively.</p>
<p>This is a small suggestion. I hope that the wise will express their opinions. At the same time, I sincerely hope that publishers can adopt and implement it.</p>

<p>— Meng Gu</p>
<p>The German secret police, world-renowned for their abuse of Jews, are said to have recently invented a new method of capital punishment. This method is very easy to do, but it is only effective in Germany. They blindfolded the prisoner, told him to stretch out his hands forward, palms open, and then placed a piece of butter and bacon on the prisoner's palms. After everything was ready, they untied the cloth covering the prisoner's eyes. The prisoner suddenly saw butter and bacon in his hands and was shocked to death.</p>
<p>Since dictators were born, many myths about dictators have sprung up all over the world. The new method of capital punishment mentioned above is certainly not true, but it is just a myth recently popular in Paris. However, Hitler took the German people's money for buying butter to buy cannons, and the people starved and suffered, regarding butter and bacon as something they could not get. If butter and bacon suddenly fell from the sky into their hands, they would hardly be able to avoid being shocked to death.</p>
<p>Although it is a myth, it is still a plausible and lovable myth.</p>

<p>— Jiali</p>
<p>When the German army swept through the small country of Belgium with a blitzkrieg strategy in 1914, a Belgian wounded soldier named Fobroke followed a group of displaced refugees and crossed the Dutch border to seek treatment in a hospital. His wound was on the heel of his left foot.</p>
<p>After the doctor performed surgery and a considerable period of recuperation, Fobroke's wound healed, and he picked up his crutches and ran to the surgeon's office to request discharge. At that time, it happened that an Englishman said to the doctor that he was looking for a proper and reliable person to take a piece of intelligence to the German-occupied Antwerp and hand it over to a British intelligence agency. Fobroke had learned some elementary English in elementary school, so he heard everything they said.</p>
<p>Fobroke deliberately coughed loudly and stretched out his bandaged foot and said, "Hide the intelligence in my wound."</p>
<p>Within a few minutes, the Dutch surgeon and the Englishman were convinced that Fobroke would not immediately become a martyr or follow in the footsteps of the assistant in a detective novel who died, and they decided to entrust the mission to Fobroke. Therefore, Fobroke was immediately sent to the operating room, where the doctor reopened his already healed wound and inserted a small silver tube containing the intelligence. When the new wound was fully closed, Fobroke walked out of the hospital, dressed like an ordinary person, leaning on a crutch, and limping.</p>
<p>How he arrived in Antwerp is unknown because he never mentioned it to anyone. His foot underwent a second operation, and as a result, the British intelligence officer obtained his intelligence.</p>
<p>Fobroke woke up from the anesthesia, gathered his courage, pointed to his foot, and asked, "Is there any reply?"</p>
<p>After the silver tube was disinfected, it was sewn back into his heel.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, Fobroke returned to Holland. His heel was cut open again, and the silver tube and the reply inside were taken out. This time his wound was finally sewn up.</p>
<p>After the armistice was signed, Fobroke quietly returned to his old business of managing his fruits and vegetables. He received three medals and a well-deserved pension. He used this money to buy half of the shares in the store. Although he was lame, he managed the store very seriously. Fobroke was kind and easy to get along with, which may be the key to his being able to safely pass through the strict German lines many times!</p>

<h3 id="e107">Recent Events in the Old Capital's Peking Opera Circle <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Shao</p>
<p>Zhang Junqiu was arrested for no reason</p>
<p>Last year, the female Peking Opera singer Xin Yanqiu was arrested in Beiping for special reasons. A certain party originally planned to execute her, but fortunately, a so-called "Commander Jin" interceded for Xin, and she was released. Recently, the famous Dan Zhang Junqiu was also arrested by a certain party. It is said that someone reported Junqiu for hiding multiple radios at home, which was related to politics. However, this was completely irrelevant. After Junqiu was arrested, many attempts to rescue him failed. Later, he was also released on bail by "Commander Jin" and was able to regain his freedom. "Commander Jin" is a woman who has special influence in Beiping, so many people in the Peking Opera circle are close to her.</p>
<p>Jin Zhongren and Xun Huisheng</p>
<p>Xiaosheng and Dan roles are very important in Peking Opera. The Xiaosheng of the four famous Dans have been partners for many years and are not easily replaced. Since Yu Zhenfei and Cheng Yanqiu broke up, Jin Zhongren recently separated from Xun Huisheng. Zhongren and Huisheng have been working together for more than ten years. Huisheng's masterpieces such as "Thirteen Sisters," "Hua Tian Cuo," and "Yu Tang Chun" cannot be performed well without Zhongren as the partner. In the middle, Huisheng once broke up with Zhongren and invited Chen Shengtai, but it was not long before Huisheng thought Shengtai was incompetent and invited Zhongren to join again. Huisheng's emphasis on Zhongren can be seen from this. Therefore, this time he resolutely separated from Jin Zhongren, which was unexpected by ordinary people. It is heard that the reason for this incident was that Zhongren followed Wang Yurong to the south last time. The supporting roles of Yurong, in addition to Jin, such as Zhu Binxian and Sun Futing, were all from Xun's troupe. Xun thought that the departure of these three people had a great impact on his performance. Although Zhongren asked Huisheng for leave before leaving, Huisheng thought that he had been very kind to Jin and should not ignore him, so he was very unhappy. As a result, after Jin returned to Beiping, he was unable to rejoin Xun's Qingsheng Society, and the Xiaosheng role of Qingsheng Society has been replaced by Xu Hecai from the Opera School. In addition, the clown Zhu Binxian was also separated from Xun in disguise because Huisheng had invited Ma Fulu for a long time. Binxian originally joined Qingsheng Society after Fulu. It is understandable that Xun abandoned Binxian and used Fulu, but it is a pity that Zhongren and Huisheng have been together for many years and are now separated.</p>
<p>Tan Fuying's "Calling Xiaofan"</p>
<p>Two years ago, Tan Fuying and Zhang Junqiu's performance in Huangjin was a sensation. Tan's plays were all sold out, especially the plays "Visiting Mother" and "Entering the Palace Twice." However, Fuying sang "Visiting Mother" four times in Huangjin, and the gag of the sentence "Standing in front of the palace gate calling Xiaofan" was not good every time. Before the fourth performance, his father, Xiao Pei, asked Fuying to practice at home in advance. Fuying worked hard to shout "Calling Xiaofan" dozens of times, and the results were quite good. However, on the stage, he still couldn't shout "Calling Xiaofan." Now that Fuying is performing in Beiping, the appeal is no less than that of Ma Lianliang. Usually, the ticket price is sold for one yuan and two jiao, but when "Visiting Mother" is performed, the seat price rises to two yuan. Every time this play is performed, it is sold out. The only fly in the ointment is that he still cannot cope with the gag of "Calling Xiaofan." It is said that Fuying must sing "Calling Xiaofan" several times when he warms up his voice at home, and he sings very well every time, but when he gets on the stage, he can't sing it. It's also a strange thing.</p>
<h3 id="e108">After Watching "Chen Yuanyuan" <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>At the banquet in Wu'an, I saw two twin-haired girls,</p>
<p>Blood and tears, the beautiful eyebrows fell into the hands of thieves and returned,</p>
<p>Not for the ruler and parents to return to the homeland,</p>
<p>But for a woman to descend the Xiong Pass.</p>
<p>In Wu Meicun's poem, he completely attributed Wu Sangui's introduction of wolves into the house and kneeling to please foreigners to "rushing to the crown in anger for a beautiful woman." This is perhaps a subconscious expression of "women are the source of trouble," but in general legends that deliberately publicize "heroes and beauties," the authors often ignore the political and social background at the time and use "personal love" to make future generations sigh endlessly. Jiang Qi's "Chen Yuanyuan" breaks away from the old category of "overthrowing the country and the city." He does not focus on Chen Yuanyuan, but criticizes the two different political tendencies of Wu Sangui and Li Chuang through the historical background of Chen Yuanyuan's character. In "Who is Chen Yuanyuan," he has this passage: "Historians have finally not obliterated their conscience. They wrote how Wu Sangui was willing to shave his hair and braid it, surrender to the Qing Dynasty, and how he forced and pressed Li Chuang to the point of exhaustion; and how cruel and brutal he was, personally killing the last drop of blood of the Ming Dynasty – the Yongli Emperor. Inadvertently, we discovered that Wu Sangui did not completely betray his country and surrender to the enemy for Chen Yuanyuan, but instead told us that Wu Sangui was mainly willing to overthrow the country because of his political ambitions." Therefore, the "Chen Yuanyuan" on the stage is not so much about recovering Chen Yuanyuan's innocence as it is about making us see Wu Sangui's face clearly. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Ju Fang</p>
<p>A few points in the article "The Struggle History of Errol Flynn" published in "The Entertainment World" the day before yesterday need to be supplemented, and are now written separately below:</p>
<p>(1) Age: Errol is British, born in Ireland on June 20, 1909. His actual age is not yet thirty-one.</p>
<p>(2) Experience: He loved adventure and once worked as a captain. He didn't leave his sailing life to join the film industry until 1933.</p>
<p>(3) Wife: His wife, Lili Damita, is a famous French film star and stage actress. She left her entertainment career after marrying Errol in 1935. They still maintain a marital relationship, but it is sometimes separated, sometimes together, sometimes good, sometimes bad. Recently, there has been news of their official divorce, but it is not known if it is correct.</p>
<p>(4) Works: In addition to martial arts and romance films such as "Captain Blood," "The Adventures of Robin Hood," and "The Dawn Patrol," his works also include the literary film "The Sisters" and the humorous films "The Perfect Specimen" and "It's Love I'm After." Therefore, it can be seen that he is a versatile actor.</p>
<p>(5) Famous Work: His famous work is the Warner Brothers blockbuster "Captain Blood." The female lead is Olivia de Havilland.</p>
<p>(6) New Work: His new work "The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex," starring Bette Davis, will soon be available for us to see.</p>

<p>The Imperial Entertainers of the Former Qing Dynasty (Part 1)</p>
<p>Those actors from the Former Qing Dynasty who were selected to serve in the inner court were called Civilian Students, and outsiders flatteringly called them Imperial Entertainers. In fact, there is a clear distinction between Imperial Entertainers and ordinary students. The name Imperial Entertainer can be traced back to the Tang Dynasty. Emperor Ming Huang loved music and created the Pear Garden, recruiting children from the common people to study songs, taught by Zhang Yefu, Lei Haiqing, Huang Fancho, Li Guinian, etc. Zhang, Li, and others often accompanied the Emperor's seat to make music together, so Zhang, Li, and others were called Imperial Entertainers, and the rest of the students were just students. Later, Emperor Zhuangzong of the Later Tang Dynasty favored actors, and some were even sent to be prefects. This was the beginning of the name Imperial Entertainer for actors. Others who each held one skill and prepared to perform plays were still just students. In the early years of the Former Qing Dynasty, following the old system of the Ming Dynasty, eunuchs and actresses were used for music and dance in front of the Emperor. It wasn't until the establishment of the Southern Troupe in the early years of Qianlong that the Inner Eunuch learned opera. After the Southern Tour, actors were selected from the common people of Jiangnan to sing in the inner court, called Southern Troupe Outside Students, to distinguish them from the Inner Eunuchs learning art. Soon, the Jingshan Outside School was added. Outside the Jingshan Outside School, there were also large and small troupes. Not only were famous actors selected, but also young children learned within, almost like the outside opera schools. If they entered the inner court to perform plays, they were called Imperial Entertainers. Can a child under the age of ten also be an Imperial Entertainer? I know that is certainly not the case. The Southern Troupe and Jingshan systems had different rewards, official salaries, and food stipends. During the Jiaqing Dynasty, two Outside School actors, Yu Fu and Lan Xiang, held sixth-rank official positions, and one, Xi Qing, held a seventh-rank official position, called official students (see the Archives of the Shengping Department in the Daoguang Year). This can truly be called Imperial Entertainers. It is clear that those who only received food stipends without official positions could not be called Imperial Entertainers.</p>
