<h3>科學家之於中國</h3>
<p>政治修明，經濟發展、以至於軍事戰爭，求其克敵致果，蓋學術界應負之責任，居其什九焉。察之此次歐戰而尤顯然，新式戰器，犀利神捷層出不窮，而造之者，運用之者，莫不視學術而判其高下。不能造此利器，雖有豐富之材料，陳於前，藏於地，廢物耳，糞壤耳；有此利器，而不能運用之，頑鐵耳，朽鋼耳；夫同是人類，同是物料，何以其巧拙判然，優劣懸殊，此無他，學術程度之不齊使然也。故昔日出入疆塲，尙力尙勇；今則較短長於彈丸之微。昔日通文墨，工應對，便得身厠仕途；今則必須學有專長，始克担當局部政務。昔日經商，懋遷有無而已；今則必先熟察國際間產銷之盈虛，供求之演變，始堪逐鹿於商塲。夫若是者，均非實學不足以收效；抑所謂學，復非攻讀幾部原理之書所得致用；蓋無常師，無常地，隨時代而推陳出新不知所止境。往之治學，數千年大體在靜態之中；講求原理原則，則有離經背道之戒；講求格物致知，則有玩物喪志之戒；造詣較深者復神秘自喜，人在術在，人亡術廢。以此衡之當前精益求精之學術世界，眞憑實據之科學精神，不但兩個時代，且爲兩個世界；古今治學之基本觀念、基本態度，洵絕不相侔者也。</p>
<p>中國於現代科學，落伍甚遠；非無傑出之士，戞戞獨造，則旣以一般水準過低，遂有與一般學術相脫節之觀，復以一般社會漠視科學與科學家，遂致湮沒其最高之功用。際此大時代，努力圖生存，惟有策動全社會，以宗敎信仰之精神，信仰科學，急起直追，庶幾有豸：謂泱泱大民族智慧不如人，謂以旣往之不如人而必今後之望塵莫及，此自暴自棄之談也。原一國學術之精進，誠有賴於獻身學術者本身之努力，亦有賴於社會督促之，獎勵之，扶掖之，信任而崇拜之，俾其人鍥而不捨，有志竟成。樹爲模楷，蔚爲風氣；一般生活而科學化，則此社會爲現代社會，此國家爲現代國家矣。若在家聽無錢電，出門坐摩托卡，此現代生活也；然而祗愛聽，祗愛坐，整個社會愛如此聽，愛如此坐，整個社會能如此買來享受而不能造、遑論發明，則落伍之甚，不科學化之甚也。何以使然？科學家誠鳳毛麟角，根本尙無養成科學家之社會使然也。興新學四五十年，小學中學即有科學之初步課程；然而傳統之不科學態度固蔽之，國家社會不竭力獎進之，風氣沮之，生活厄之；反之，不知科學爲何物之種種人物亦能求利得利，求名得名；而若干研習科學者之得名得利乃至有祿有位者，却又未必以其研習科學始得而有之。</p>
<p>夫科學家之有成就，非一朝一夕間事，亦非一蹴可幾，養成科學家，國家與社會共有之責也。試取證於科舉時代：江蘇以獨多狀元稱，非蘇人特優秀，亦爲蘇省經濟條件優裕，可以涵養文風，士子乃得悉心揣摩，無虞凍餒。科學家自非習制藝之秀才可比；實事求是，絲毫不可勉强，處處崇尙實騐，器械也，藥品也，材料也，恒久之功夫也，設備之周密也，再仆再起之精神財力也；缺一，則有不能進境者矣，有功虧一簣者矣；故欲養成科學家，必須使有志研習科學者生活安定。此在國家培植無論矣，其於社會，淸寒學生學費之補助，漸成風氣，而於科學事業之獎助金，雖有所聞，尙屬罕覯；今後安得亦如獎學基金之得聞風興起也。若夫今日之工業，近代科學之產物也；處日新月異之時代，尤非有埋頭苦幹急起直追之科學家，從事於改進不爲功。故各工廠故步自封，願甘失敗則已，否則應就其一廠或一業之力，每年各就所盈中，提出若干，作爲與其事業直接間接有關之科學獎勵金。一方面尤望有志靑年，集合同志，從事研究，造成不少業餘科學家，務使社會對於科學，富於興趣，丕然成風，則中國科學之進步，當可計日而待；而平素享人科學之惠者，亦得以科學上之成就報之。「爲民生致福利，爲萬世開太平，」科學家之責任固有不容忽視者矣。</p>

<p>香港　東京訊、今晨此間之重要報紙皆對英美之日漸接近、發表評論、各報認爲英首相邱吉爾前日下院中之演說、以及羅斯福與金氏之會商、皆足以表現英美兩七已日形接近、各報社論多認爲英國現時租借予美之島嶼、雖限於大西洋、但將來或有一日亦可將太平洋之英國屬地租借予美、「朝日新聞」指稱、如英國果擬將其太平洋屬地以及如澳大利亞委治地中俾斯麥羣島曁其他等地租予美國、則日本自表莫大之關切、日日新聞」載稱、英國爲解脫自身之危離、竟企圖破壞太平洋現狀、日本對此必須堅決反對、「讀賣新聞」載稱、現時英國借予美國之島嶼、雖未將太平洋包括在內、但將來時局演變、租借之範圍延及太平洋、實屬自然之趨勢、其中尤以溫哥華及維多利亞地處北太平洋之咽喉、美加協議結果、亦將成爲美國之空軍根據地、同時美國擬議中之經由加拿大軍事路綫、苟延至阿拉斯加、則阿拉斯加及白令羣島將如夏威夷島而爲美國之前哨空軍根據地、其與美國本部之距離更將縮短、由此觀點觀之、英美及美加之協定、不僅影饗歐洲之局勢、對日本之將來亦有重大之影響、（二十二日電）</p>
<h3>歷史上重要紀念日　德蘇協定一週年　兩國政治經濟合作　奠定永久和好基礎</h3>
<p>莫斯科　一九四〇年八月二十三日爲蘇德不侵犯公約簽訂一週紀念、消息報今以「歷史上重要紀念日」著評稱、「戰爭挑釁者故意煽起蘇德仇視、但自不侵犯公約簽訂後、此種仇視業已終止、在蘇聯共黨第十八屆大會時、史丹林向一切企圖將蘇聯捲入戰禍藉謀本身利益之戰爭挑釁者提出嚴重警吿、當時英國及北美報紙曾發明德國「攫取」蘇維埃烏克蘭「計劃」、但爲史氏所指破、史氏云、「此種叫囂之目的、似係引起蘇聯對德國之仇視、毒化當時空氣、並無理由的向德引起戰爭」、在同一報吿內、史丹林明白闡述蘇聯外交政策、彼云、「吾人企求和平並謀與各國增加貿易關係、此爲吾人之立塲、苟他國確與吾人維持同樣之關係、並不作侵害吾人利益之企圖、則吾人必將堅持此種立塲」、根據此項政策、蘇聯當卽接受德方建議、開始談判不侵犯公約、在進行談判時、雙方均依據各個之國家基本利益、莫洛託夫在第四屆蘇聯最高議會大會中稱、「歷史證明蘇德戰爭及仇視對雙方均有弊無利、一九一四—一九一八戰爭結果、蘇德蒙受損失最重、因此蘇德人民之利益、決不在互相仇視、相反的、蘇德人民需要和平的關係」、一九三九年八月二十三日簽訂之蘇德公約、非特係蘇德關係史中之重要轉捩點、且亦爲全歐及全世界之重要轉捩點、該公約誠爲近數十年來外交關係中之最重要文件、（未完待續）（二十三日塔斯電）</p>
<p>柏林　德報於德蘇不侵犯協定第一週年紀念日、在政治經濟軍事各方面檢討該協定之效果、「愛森國民日報」宣稱、德蘇兩國於一九三九年八月二十三日簽訂不侵犯協定、此條簡明之條文、規定簽字國之關係、並創造和平之空氣、使德蘇兩國在各方面互相合作、兩國領袖已使兩國人民相處於誠實之基礎之上、德蘇不侵犯協定簽訂於歐戰之前夕、對於軍事方面自有重要之影響、而德蘇兩國在經濟方面之合作亦具重要意義、至一九三九年二十三日簽訂運輸協定、一九四〇年二月十一日復簽訂各項經濟協定、均非偶然之後果、德蘇不侵犯協定業已確立兩國之友好關係、並奠定各項協定之基石、德國對西歐各國作戰、不復有後顧之憂、同時蘇聯亦可避免牽入戰爭漩渦、德蘇兩國均獲得各項經濟利益、而歐洲之建設工作亦有進展之可能矣、「德意志外交政治通訊報」宣稱、蘇聯鑑於歐局之不安、以聰明之行動、消除紛爭之可能、德蘇合作之第一年成績、已證明不侵犯協定之簽字國已實現其希望、蘇聯已消除西陲之不穩定與不滿意之因素、德國因德蘇貨物之交換而滿足其需要、德蘇兩國具有合作之決心、一年來對於各項問題、均以正當之途徑加以解決云、（二十三日海通電）</p>
<h3>日本嚴厲　統制食米　下月一日起實施</h3>
<p>東京電　農林省宣布自九月十日起、日本將實施白米特別統制條例、而使政府完全統制全國主要糧食白米之收買與分配、據都新聞」載稱、按諸新條例、民衆非經政府統制分配機關之手、不能獲得白米、白米收買與分配、巳由帝國農業會社及日本米公司統一事權、在產地實行統制、可以銷除產地居民獲米較城市銷費中心點爲易之怨言、嗣後凡產米者無論爲田主或租戶、僅能將米售與帝國農業會社、不得售與他人、唯政府與政府節制之日本米公司有收集米糧之權、因此凡居城中之田主、亦不能獲得其本人田中所產之米、卽產地農民所食之米、亦須由售米會社或經當局承認之商行分配予之、各縣間運輸米糧亦受統制、而使農民不能以米送與其在城市中求學之子女、卽以米易物亦在禁例、其嚴厲可見一斑云、（二十三日電）</p>

<h3>加强中區防務　鐵甲車今晨出防　漏夜發給步槍並予訓練　英輕騎隊亦交召集協助</h3>
<p>公共租界英軍防地之虹口西區、現暫由萬國商團A字大隊（卽英國隊）約三百人接防、惟團員均係義務、且各有其他正當職業、亦未能置之不顧、是以公共租界當局、曾考慮召集B字大隊（卽美國隊）以便輪流塡防、昨向租界當局關係方面探悉·商團美國隊伍、仍因日方反對商團英國隊以外隊伍接防虹口西區關係、故萬國商團之美國隊伍迄至昨晚、尙未有命令召集、因此公共租界當局、不得不於昨日下午五時、復又發出命令、召集萬國商團聯隊中之英國隊伍鐵甲隊一隊、於今晨起掛動、藉以補救目前A字犬隊之困難、此外萬國商團總司令部中英國輕騎隊亦將召集、至於B字大隊、因日方猶未同意、故迄未召集協助、</p>
<p>鐵甲車隊奉令召集</p>
<p>自昨午十一時三十分、本埠英防軍約六百人、繼續離滬撤退後、A字大隊之所負防務、殊感不足、租界當局、特於昨晚五時、由萬國商團總司令亨佩、發出命令、召集商團聯隊中之鐵甲車隊、以資協助、該鐵甲車隊亦係英籍隊伍、惟向不屬於A字大隊、而編入萬國商團之聯隊中者、原有定額爲一六九人、但亦多缺額、現僅九十餘名、</p>
<p>漏夜發槍今晨接防</p>
<p>英籍鐵甲車隊、其所習者、係鐵甲車戰之訓練、對於步戰、則比較上未如戰車上之嫻熟、且其平日所用之武器、除鐵甲車上之魯意斯式機槍外、僅爲七吋左輪手槍、商團司令部以此之故、特於昨晚召集漏夜發給步槍、及步槍子彈、並臨時由萬國商團司令部敎官、於工部局營房內、敎練步隊之必要技術、定於今晨起、卽須出防、以協助A字大隊、</p>

<h3>某軍略家　泛論歐戰</h3>
<p>此間某軍略家談、德國制勝英國、業已失去時機、蓋德軍倘於五月十八日攻陷色當後、卽直趨巴黎、則巴黎或能早於一二星期陷落、設德軍於佔領巴黎後、卽轉而攻擊英國、則彼時之英國最精良陸軍均在法國、且對於應付沿海之奇襲攻擊、少有準備、自屬易於成功、遷延至今、英國已獲得空中之優勢、而海上之控制及陸上之防禦、亦有長足進步、故此後困難、必愈增矣、</p>

<p>股票交易、成交大生第一廠股二十股、價爲十四元正、</p>
<p>衆業公所股市、續形堅昂、各股價格、繼漲增高、極少回頭、對週末了結視若無事、故幾於無股不漲、橡皮股最受歡迎、成交之鉅、在單純之上午交易過程中、爲多時所未見、欲將上漲各股、個列舉、甚感困難、蓋市况堅度、太覺普遍、至此種蓬勃趨勢、能吾賡續、有待下星期之事實證明、</p>
<p>倫敦二十三日（週四）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛脾行市、仍告平滯、祇匯豐銀行香港註册股上升半鎊、價爲六十八鎊半、英倫註冊不動、其餘亦無變化、</p>

<p>紗市始平後緊、趨勢略顯高翔、此因盤旋已久、而不下降、引起一部份投磯者心思活動、復來吸收幾包、同時對於套出九月份之期貨、茲以獲利、亦來抵補、因此人心震盪、市面已得回蘇之象、不過實際銷路、依然狹隘、存貨尚厚、未見减輕、根本問題、須恃消費爲第一也、九月期價始做九百二十四元、繼至九百三十四元、</p>
<p>現貨晨開市場平庸、形勢和善、二十支雙馬開價爲九百二十六元、予上日之盤不相上下、此盤一開、絕少變化、大家相顧而不動生色、因之盤旋甚久、迨至收盤時、稍帶昂張、因空頭執進九月份、人心提起、二十支雙馬收盤爲九百二十六元半、以後做至九百三十二元、查半日間成交統計一千七百九十包、行情一十支雙馬漲三元半、今日有棉紗三百八十件運烟臺、六十件運天津、昨日尚有九百四十七件運烟臺、五百三十七件運香港、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行一·五二〇　香港　一八五　溫州五〇</p>
<p>內地　一二五　統計一·七九〇</p>
<h3>現棉交易零星</h3>
<p>現棉情形稍見開展、但廠方仍無躉批吸收、惟零星添補之原棉交易、時有而小斷、所以行情微帶堅挺、至於同行抵解頭襯生意較夥、棉價火機花草包價一百五十四元、白包在一百六十元、通州好貨價爲一百八十元、棉市就大勢情况論之、亦在水平綫上云、最大因素、爲新棉不久當可上塲、今庚天氣乾燥、產熟時令較往年爲先、因之各方心思、暫作觀望之舉、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、市况又趨靜寂、因市上缺乏買戶、同時又有一部份多額了結、結果收盤價格、較之上日跌落四五磅音、印度棉市、昨日連同預測跌一羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來稍見鬆動、日方廠商已略見採購、惟爲數不巨、同業間因深悉市上現貨之不多、及到船日稀、故有意採購之心頗濃、雖成交不多、然人心却異常堅定也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　鰲江能否通航　華廠布銷所繋</h3>
<p>國廠布　昨市局勢平靜、實銷出路太窄、囤戶亦鮮活動、惟執貨者態度鎭定、哈納輪決定復航鰲江、結果若何、於布市前途影響頗巨、昨布價殊少變動、散額手貨每疋跌一角至二角半、本街辦色丁直貢絨布各類坯布二萬餘疋、粗布色布印花貨二百餘件、粤港幫辦色布斜紋等貨二百餘件、北路烟臺幫辦粗布印花布百餘件、</p>
<p>東布　晨平午漲、趨勢堅穩、白貨龍頭細布上午盤旋於三十元〇八九角、下午收盤最高價售開三十一元一角半、四君子嗶嘰升至九角一分二厘半、雖成交不多、而市氣殊緊、</p>
<p>出口　棉布、昨日（二十三日）有四百五十七件、運往烟臺、又有五百十七件、運往香港、今日則有四十件、運往天津、另有八百二十件、運往烟臺、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米又到　去路平淡</h3>
<p>洋米昨日實銷又淡、本街有平糶關係、久管暢胃、內地客幫因採運問題尚未解決、未有繼起辦裝、新囤戶乃不敢儘興收買、故開市後卽見盤落半元、後市雖有鄕戶及內地零星去化、而結果終見疲勢、一號陳西貢爲五十九元五十八元七角、新尖五十七元二角五十七元、二一號五十三元八角、一號暹邏五十八元半、二號五十三元、五十二元六角、火絞五十八元、五十七元、香港尖五十七元三角、五十五元、决五十二元半、小絞五十三元二角、五十三、東京砶尖四十八元半、四十八元、糙尖四十七元半、四十七元、碎尖四十三四元、米茶四十五元七角四十五元、回籠原包供過於求、二號暹邏自六十三元小至六十二元半、又比前日小去一元、二號西貢亦自六十三元小至六十二元半、小半元、惟米茶有本銷、價開五十五元半、反好半元、總計開出二百二十噸、現米則祇四十包云、</p>
<p>洋米昨日有大批到滬、計一萬六千三百零一包、係順亨洋行經理之蘭地（Randi)號輪、由西貢直接運來、昨午抵埠、現停靠法租界外灘天文臺碼頭起卸、</p>
<p>粳糥國米到貨共祇六七百包、明暗市交易、傳聞亦轉平淡、所以形成供求相仿、售價悉守原盤、無甚榮辱、</p>
<p>周浦新粳抵埠者仍寥、祇二十四擔、早市因他貨悉疲、相隨帶軟、惟後卽亦回緊、故價初開六十二元、六十一元三角、結果特別仍爲六十三元、</p>
<h3>日粉先平後堅　麥市參差</h3>
<p>麵粉昨日交易仍以日廠粉爲大宗、蓋以華廠粉福新及老車牌、雖有供給、爲數甚微、一般投機性質者、大都注意買賣、鳳凰牌期貨、市面初開尚平、嗣以空頭抵進及現粉略有去路、價乃回升數分至角半、計開本月份十四元三角至三角半、九月份十四元五角半、十月份十四元七角、成交共有七千餘包、至華粉廠盤仍爲十五元、成交的有三千包、其他各粉、進出兩少、市面平平、又麵粉昨有一千五百包、運往天津、</p>
<p>小麥昨日新麥市况尚鮮巨大出入、貨主方面、大多數扳守不願輕脫、但有一部份零星販戶、暗中貶脫者、亦不乏人、故市面稍有參差、昨聞送廠貨的有三四千包、售價均未作實、華廠方面進價仍爲。一十三元左右、進高杜麥五六百包、</p>
<p>苞米今日有三百包、運往威海衛、</p>
<h3>糖市　車白開八千包</h3>
<p>昨糖市上落無多、公會劃盤、現貨二叫粗白本棧七十三元半、外棧新貨七十三元半、老貨七十二元八角至九角、轉口貨卽打棧單五十八元四角、九月六日交貨五十九元、荷棉白略鬆、TML嘜七十三元二角、小三角、KD嘜七十一元半、小七角、荷赤連漲後稍有回小、昨爲六十二元半、太古車白B嘜七十四元半至七十四元、小七角、下檔降度較多、DY嘜六十九元、降二元、HX嘜六十八元六角、降度相同、本月底交割者同價、H嘜車赤六十元二角、小八角、太古洋行開出卽裝車白共的八千包之譜、計DY嘜爲港幣一二·八〇、HX嘜一二·七〇、合價較宜、故劃盤亦隨鬆也、本廠雪白七十一元、小一元、本冰無更動、</p>
<h3>南北貨　新圓肉續跌</h3>
<p>海南新圓肉、此次到貨見增、市勢續軟、但本屆出數較去年爲豐、不能守而不兌、故南北市號方所到昨已如數開通、較高者爲百三十元、以决稍减、聞香港市價較申爲佳、此後來源、或將减少、後市得由此轉機、亦屬可能、</p>
<h3>海味　關裏暇尾獻新</h3>
<p>烟臺關裏蝦尾、新貨首批運到六箱、色澤至佳、惜隻形甚小、故難售高價、昨日卽以二百八十七元開通、聞不日將有續到云、</p>
<h3>雜項　香烟廠產不充</h3>
<p>連日香烟暗盤步漲、因廠方出貨不暢、各地銷路頗健、致行情緊俏、昨市開大英牌一千零八十二元、老刀牌七百九十四元、小仙女五百二十五元、五華牌五百十四元、大東公司出品小香檳牌因外匯關係、價漲二十五元、新價爲四百七十一元、</p>

<h3>接報笑談</h3>
<p>蘇郡每逢鄕試之年，各屬接報舟船，俱停於山塘桐橋一帶，諸生每於揭曉日，徘徊橋畔，盼望佳音。有某生道一接報故事，聞之旣堪捧腹，亦足警心！據云某科某省某府，赴試者數百人，揭曉後，均往城外探望報船，遙聞鑼聲喧闐不已，旋見高扯接報黃旗，兩櫓雙槳，舟如箭激，將及城邊，諸生鵠立兩岸，延頸招手，倉皇問信，猶見白髮門斗，危立船頭，抖擻精神，鳴鑼不巳，左右環顧，見諸生詢問急迫，乃始住手，厲聲對衆而言曰：「諸位相公，平日以酒館爲書房，烟館爲學堂，妓館爲文塲，賭館爲考棚，不讀詩書，不念文章，今科榜上，府府有人，縣縣有名，惟有我這這裏，半個沒有，都落在大海汪洋；還有我，指望報喜，賺些銀洋，到而今，貼了辛苦，賠了工夫，何處賠償，試問諸位相公有面光沒面光！」言畢，一手擲鑼，一手拋鎚，長歎進艙。諸生知係脫科，無暇與之計較，各自垂頭喪氣而歸。至下科，則該府中式者，倍於他處云。</p>

<h3>自由談第三十年</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>從今天起，自由談是進入第三十週年了。</p>
<p>在中國各日報的副刊中，自由談該算是歷史最悠久的一種了。當我們把民國誕生前後的舊報翻出來看的時候，我們彷彿是在讀民國的歷史，我們看見時代的巨輪在轉動着，我們看見革命的思潮在孕育着，我們看見新中國在坐長起來。而自由談就創刊在這個時候。一九一一一年八月二十四日）</p>
<p>許多年靑的讀者，也許沒有機會看到幼年時代自由談的面目，我們特地在道第三十年的開始，由各階段中選了一部份重新發表出來，算是一個小小的紀念。</p>
<p>這些短短的文章，都曾在上一代人的腦中留下痕跡，發生過作用的。</p>
<p>辛亥七月初一日（一九一一年八月廿四日）</p>
<h3>慷慨悲哥歌　岳武穆詩詞</h3>
<p>宋岳武穆滿江紅詞。慷慨激昂。人多傳誦之。而不知其詩詞尚多可傳。如送紫巖張先生北伐云。號令風霆迅。天聲動北陬。長驅入河洛。直搗向燕幽。馬蹀閼氏血。旗梟可汗頭。歸來報明主。恢復舊神州。誄適齋先生云。南渡已三紀。衣冠今幾存。傷心失故老。回首望中原。去國權臣力。全軀聖主恩。致君堯舜日。衷意托微言。寄浮屠慧海云。溫浦廬山幾度秋。長江曲折向東流。男兒立志扶王室。聖主專征滅虜酋。功業要刊燕石上。歸休終伴赤松游。可嚀寄語東林老。蓮社從今著力修。題驟馬崗云。立馬林崗豁戰眸。陣雲開處一溪流。機春水澁猶傳晋。黍秀宮庭孰憫周。南服只今　小醜。北轅何日返神州。誓將七尺酬明聖。怒指天涯淚不收。題貴池齋山壁云。年來塵土滿征衣。得得閒吟上翠微。好水好山看不盡。馬蹄催趁月明歸。小重山詞云。昨夜寒蛩不住鳴。驚回千里夢。已三更。起來獨自遶階行。人悄悄簾外月籠明。白首爲功名。舊山松竹老。阻歸程。欲將心事付瑤琴。知音少。絃斷有誰聽。</p>

<p>— 王錫林</p>
<p>目今大局。言之可怕。流氓土匪。殺人放火。惡棍土豪。姦佔民婦。廣東水災。杭州大火。外洋黨人。幸災樂禍。乘此機會。胡行亂做。各省將軍。節節防堵。歐洲戰爭。累及中土。各國輪船。停止裝貨。貧民小工。實在苦楚。開門七件。油鹽醬醋。腰無半文。肚皮飢餓。無計可施。逼走險路。强盜越多。居民越苦。有種朋友。糊裏糊塗。公益事體。一件弗做。呼朋引類。麻將义义。同字一色。實在難做。起碼三檯。九十六和。莊家自模。阿要埋虎。西瓜吃吃。香炯呼呼。馬將义完。六點敲過。坐坐一桌。大小老婆。有湯有炒。有葷有素。談談說說。提起時局。住在鄕間。覺得不妥。想着上海。仙鄉樂土。連夜叫船。輪船帶拖。拖到租界。公館野大。新戲看看。汽車坐坐。夜花園裏。家家到過。木林先生。已入迷途。後事如何。難以逆睹。胡言亂語。一榻糊塗。閱者諸君。請代續補。（五）</p>

<h3>自由談　三言兩語</h3>
<p>我正在說學潮沒甚好看。不如平心靜氣。等到八月十八日上海寗觀潮去。却不道北京女師大的學潮反掀得益發高了。好多個女學生。都受了傷。頭破血流。只索進醫院去。這回子沒打死人。還算是幸事。不然學舍之中。一片血潮。還成甚麼話麼。看來以後做父兄的。送子女進畢堂去。非給他們請保鏢不行。至少也得向保險公司中保保險免得出了整筆的學費。打死了再要出葬殮費啊。</p>

<h3>記秋瑾女俠集</h3>
<p>— 吉羊</p>
<p>黃海舟中感懷聞這當年鏖戰地。至今猶帶血痕流。馳驅戎馬中原夢•破碎河山故國羞。領海無權悲索莫。磨刀有日快思　·天風吹面冷然過。十萬雲烟眼底收。</p>
<p>感憤　莽莽神州嘆陸沈。教時無計愧倫生。搏沙有愿興亡楚·博浪無椎擊暴秦。國破方知人種賤。義高不礙客囊貧。經營恨未酬同志。把劍悲歌涕淚橫。</p>
<p>民國二十二年八月廿六日</p>
<h3>各種捐班</h3>
<p>— 洛文</p>
<p>淸朝的中葉，要做官可以捐，叫做「捐班」的便是這一夥。財主少爺吃得油頭光臉，忽而忙了幾天，頭上就有一粒小晶頂，有時還加上一枝舊翎，滿口官話，說是「今天天氣好」了。</p>
<p>到得民國，官總算是沒有了捐班，而捐班之塗，實際上倒是開展了起來，連「學士文人」也可以由此弄得到頂戴。開宗明義第一章，自然是要有錢。只要有錢，就什麼都容易辦了。譬如，要捐學者罷，那就收買一批古董，結識幾個法客，並且僱幾個工人，拓出古董上面的花紋和文字，用玻璃版印成部書，名之曰「什麼集古錄」或「什麼考古錄」·李富孫做過部金石學錄」，是專載研究金石的人們的，然而這倒成了「作俑」，使法客們可以一續再續，並且推而廣之，連收藏古董，販賣古董的少爺和商人，也都一榻括子的收進去了，這就叫作「金石家」。</p>
<p>捐做「文學家」也用不着新花樣。只要開一隻書店。拉幾個作家，僱一些幫閑，出一種小報，「今天天氣好」是也須會說的，就寫了出來，印了上去，交給報販，不消一年半載，包管成功。但是古董的花紋和文字的拓片是不能用的了，應該代以電影明星，和摩登女子的照片，因爲這才是新時代的美術。「愛美」的人物在中國還多得很，而「文學家」或「藝術家」也就這樣的起來了。</p>
<p>捐官可以希望刮地皮，但捐學者文人也不會折本。印刷品固然可以賣現錢，古董將來也會有洋鬼子肯出大價的。</p>
<p>這也叫「名利雙收「。不過先要能「投資」，所以平常人做不到，要不然，文人學士也就不大值錢了。</p>
<p>而現在還值錢，所以也還會有人忙着做人名辭典，造文藝史，出作家論，編自傳。我想，倘作歷史的著作，是應該像將文人分爲羅曼派，古典派一樣，另外分出一種「捐班」派來的，歷史要「眞」，招些忌恨也只好硬挺，是不是？</p>
<p>民國廿八年八月三日</p>
<h3>不動心</h3>
<p>— 瑜</p>
<p>聽見惡消息，我們自然要皺一下眉頭，咬一下牙齒；同樣，聽見好消息，我們也不免點一下頭，作會心的微笑。人類是感情的動物，在感情上受到可恨或可喜的波動，有這種表示，乃是理所當然的。</p>
<p>然而我以爲我們在平時作這種感情的表示，是隨便的，在這非常的大時代，道就不應該，並且不够了。</p>
<p>我們在一起首，便已知道我們責任的艱鉅，並且我們也早已立定意志，要不　環境如何變更，百折不撓，來達到我們的目的。那未，任何外來的消息，不論惡的或好的，我們除了密切注意，取作參考以外，我們實在沒有動感情的理由。並且恨的感情表示，往往會使人懊喪，而喜的感情表示，則又往往會使人懈怠。由懊喪而志氣消沈，由懈怠而精神渙散，乃是必然的結果，我們絕對不需要！</p>
<p>不動感情，就是我們先哲所說的不動心。這原是古往今來一切大人物所必須修養到的工夫。我們現在的人，當然不見得個個是大人物，但我們是黃帝的千孫，天之驕子，我們決不敢妄自菲薄。我們是大國的國民，要在這生死存亡的關頭，大家不動心。</p>
<p>我們決不是冷酷無情。實在的，我們的感情，完全寄託在我們的國家民族身上，已經超出了平常的感情範圍了。假使說我們還不免於因恨而皺眉，因笑而展顏的，我們定在這笑與皺眉之外，要加倍努力，來達到我們感情的完全發作</p>
<p>在這感情的完全發作還沒有達到以前，我們就只有不動心。並且我們應該知道。除了我們的狄人以外，其他友人的作爲，雖然有時與我們不利，似乎不幫我們，大都也只是爲了他們自己的利益，並非有所怨於我們；同樣，除了我們目己以外，他們雖然有時與我們有利，似乎幫我們，也往往爲了他們自己的利益，並非一定有所愛於我們。那末，我們那裏正應該因他們而忽恨忽喜呢</p>
<p>一泰山崩於前，而色不變；麋鹿興於左，而且不憐，一我們要這樣的不動心，只望着目的向前直跑才是！否則，此後，惡消息或好消息，將續續而來，我們只有感情衝動，還能作什麼呢？</p>
<p>民國廿三年八月十七日</p>
<p>說來也並不奇怪，爲什麼到了夏天，關心世道人心的先生們對於男女之大「防」要突然加緊？夏天的女人的裝束實在太富於挑撥性，而「挑撥」的焦點在於肉體部分呈露得太多，所以取締女人露腿赤脚的官文正是扣準了題目的得意之作。</p>
<p>我們的祖先在山林子裏過「野蠻」生活的時候，本無章身之具；大家光裸裸看慣了，並不覺得什麼｛然而這正是野蠻人之所以爲粗淺。「文明人」頭腦複雜得多了，凡事都講究個「含蓄」，「有盡不盡」；從此而「聯想」也特別發達，見一光露的小腿就覺得有點那個了•其實腿只是腿而已，遠不及眉毛能說話，眼睛會「送媚」。說到這裏，就不能不佩服從前土耳其女人上街要帶面紗這一辦法爲能眞正澈底</p>
<p>至於露了腿還要搽什麼油膏，撰什慶粉，赤了脚還要染紅指甲，從貪圖簡便凉快一變而爲要麻煩要好看，——道眞是更駭聽聞。自然，這樣搽之撰之染之的腿，恐怕只是光腿中間極少的一部份。牠們的目的，和普通的光腿完全兩樣。此等腿不但不許牠「光」，激底些不妨投畀煤窰，所可惜者，此等腿大都坐在汽車裏，奉公守法的警察先生只好牠朝看看罷了。</p>
<p>再從反面一想，腿主人不怕麻煩而搽油撲粉，無非爲要好看。把腿弄好看了，也不是自己欣賞，而爲的是那個抓權禁止光腿的男性社會需要這等樣的裝束修飾。據說從前有過女性中心的社會，那時候，男人們是不是也像現在的女人那樣刻意艷妝，我們還不大明白，但是吳敬梓却在「鏡花緣」裏給我們一個回答。「鏡花緣」裏女兒國的男人卽使是一部大黑鬍子也還要搽脂抹粉。然而現在關心世道人心的先生們讀「鏡花緣」到這一段時不肯掩卷想一想。</p>
<p>民國廿七年十月十日</p>
<h3>簡單化</h3>
<p>— 白屋</p>
<p>能够簡單化，那自然是很好的。因為能簡單就能定。「定而后能靜，靜而后能安，安而后能慮，慮而后能得！於是提倡「簡單化」者有所「得」了。</p>
<p>可是「得」，有時是不足以償「失」，那也非常的顯明。舉個例吧，有人是這樣說：</p>
<p>「無論如何，如國仍可以用不干涉的方法勸告中日兩國進行調解，這也許會把事情變得簡單化。」</p>
<p>各國爲什麼又要「不干涉」？却又要「勸告」呢？為人道？爲正義？爲人類的文化？然而在人道·正義·人類的文化的面前，那就該有分明的是非與熱烈的好惡。不是「不干涉」，不是「勸告」，而是國聯會所決定的「援助」被侵略者！」</p>
<p>這一來，事情就不簡單化了，因爲還要打下去。</p>
<p>本來也並不簡單：侵略戰與反侵略戰，這關係是國際的，美國的解放戰爭，也並不僅是美國的，而是國奈的，因爲這是正義人道的勝利，人類自此堪稱爲人類了。祇有把一切歷史進化的法則，納入於個人的或少數集團的利得之中，那自然事情可以簡單化了？這就是叫中國永遠一殖民地」下去，叫侵略者永遠「帝國主義」下去。人爲刀俎，我爲魚肉，何等簡單！</p>
<p>然而司馬昭之心，路人皆知！中國大多數的民衆是不會永遠被騙下去的！</p>

<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第五章　惡消息</p>
<p>施桂在旁邊接嘴說：「拿什麼？我給你去拿。」</p>
<p>我搖搖頭，便一直上樓去。我拿的東西，主要的是一支黑鋼的小手槍，還有較尺紙片等應用物件。因爲我門此刻要找尋的人，他是帶着手槍的，我當然不能不戒備一下。一分鐘後，我已跟着倪金壽上了他的汽車。倪金壽的汽車是另外有汽車夫的，我和他並肩坐在車廂中，地位覺得很舒爽。在汽車開行以後，我向他在偵查方面有沒有共他的情報。他又簡括地回答了幾句。</p>
<p>他說道：「我曾到揚子旅社去，查問過那銀行家陸健笙昨夜的行踪，他是那裏的老主顧，茶房們都認識他，可是昨夜裏他却沒有去。」</p>
<p>我說道：「金梅說，陸健笙今天曾打電話到王麗蘭家去問過，他自稱昨夜一夜在揚子旅社打牌，天明回家，才知道這個兇信。」</p>
<p>「是啊，霍先生就爲着這過，在我們分別時，特地叫我去查問的。可是他昨夜裏實在不曾去。」</p>
<p>「那末，他爲什麼說謊？這個人倒也有些可疑。」</p>
<p>倪金壽躊躇了一下，緩緩答道：「不過，就是這一點還算不得什麼。眼前比他嫌疑更重的人很多。我們不應就把他排進嫌疑人裏去。」</p>
<p>我靜默了一下，覺得倪金壽對於這位銀行家，的確有幾分顧忌，我當然不便再繼續這個話題。　（八五）</p>

<h3>閒談影星們的芳名</h3>
<p>— 灃</p>
<p>現在我國幾位女明星的命名，就字義上說，最佳妙的要算陳燕燕，最大方的要算顧蘭君；因爲她們兩位的名字，都超越尋常一般以紅香綠玉命名範圍之外，而自成其馨逸的。考辭源，「燕燕」重言燕也。（詩經）燕燕于飛，古人每用鶯鶯燕燕來代表姝麗，就是道偭意思。且古有「鶯鶯」，今有「燕燕」，雙文相映成趣。「蘭君」二字，「蘭」是香草之名，古人因其香氣淸遠，取爲佩御之物，「君」是尊稱，婦稱夫（古樂府，十七爲君婦。）夫稱婦（漢書，歸遺細君。）皆曰「君」，還有封號稱「君」，如孟嘗君春申君等，而婦人的封號，古人亦稱「君」，所以用「蘭君」取名，不但表示美人芳草，不同凡卉，並且有比德古人，錫以榮封之意，是何等典雅大方呢。其次白虹單以「虹」字爲名，光氣變化而爲「虹」，分成種種顏色，非常美麗，故題名爲「虹」，倒也新韻而有意義。這與周璇「璇璣」的「璇」字題名，有異曲同工之妙。陳雲裳的「雲裳」字，並非說「雲裳霞佩」，當屬嫦娥仙子一流，非人間所有。周曼華的「曼華」二字，「曼」有「輕細」和「修長」兩種意義，「華」可解作美觀，這與王熙春袁美雲等一樣不脫窠臼。最奇的，張翠紅的「翠紅」二字，「翠」是翠烏，翠玉，凡靑綠色皆稱「翠」，又「翠」又「紅」，這是甚麼顏色？查辭源又有尾肉曰「翠」（禮記，舒雁翠。一條，那麼她的「翠」字，作尾肉解吧，可是底下有「紅」字，好像更不對了，反不如李紅單用一個「紅」字，當她紅紫之紅解也可，當她顯寵走紅解也可，倒覺直捷爽快而無語病，比較翠紅好得多了。</p>
<h3>羣英社義務工演記</h3>
<p>— 病鳩</p>
<p>本市羣英聯歡社爲時思小學籌募敎育經費，二十一日夜塲假座卡爾登戲院舉行平劇彩排，名票參加者甚衆。筆者九時到院，榮寶錦郁念慈之「打漁殺家」方登塲，榮君之蕭恩，嗓音雖覺沈瘖，做工却頗老到，配以在悅知之敎師，臨時抓哏，妙語如珠，丑角雋才也。决爲王霞影之「六月雪」，由蓋三省藝員飾禁婆，蓋伶在黃金屢陪京朝派名角演此劇，斵輪老手，自是不凡，王小姐寶娥，儀容沈靜，步履輕盈，深合靑衣格律，水袖工夫，美化程度未到，險上表情，極能傳神，出塲搖板，抑揚得宜，大段慢板，歌來若斷若續，如泣如訴，調格純以峻險取勝，深得收放縱擒之法，採用程腔兼有梅味，此乃得力於李琴仙敎導之功。法塲一塲，實娥臉不上油，僅以髮絲披面，輓近坤旦多如此，無形中減弱恐怖氣氛不少，「上天天無路入地地無門」之白口，凄凉哀厲，能以舒卷婉激之音調出之，頗爲難得，猶憶珠塵演此，眼停體倚，作昏迷狀態，情形之凄慘，坤旦中無有過此者。後段反二黃以衷氣關係，未見佳妙，反調較正調多三個音階，非有佳嗓，不易討好，內行且視爲畏途，邊論票友，何忍深責！大軸「黃鶴樓」，華震亞之劉備，詹筱珊之趙雲，崔　先之周瑜，張哲生之張飛，勢均力敵，銖　悉稱，華震亞以麒派老生名於時，與張中原齊名，以是舉手投足，皆有分寸，非有工力不克臻此。崔逖先票界小生之傑才，單挑戲能動「雅觀樓」「八大鎚」，故演來綽然有餘，不費氣力，而自然佳妙。張哲生實大聲宏，有如黃鐘大呂，票界之金少山也。惜以時晏，未帶水戰爲憾耳。</p>

<h3>Confused News of the Vietnam Incident: French Government Determined to Protect Rights, Warns Public Not to Believe Rumors, Awaits Negotiation Results; One Account Says Japan's Request Has Been Accepted, Allowing Japanese Troops to Pass Through; Chinese Army Denies Entering Vietnamese Territory</h3>
<p>VICHY: The French government yesterday warned the public not to lightly believe rumors spread by foreign countries regarding the current situation in Annam, and asked the public to calmly await the outcome of negotiations with Japan. France's rights will definitely be protected. (Haitong Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>HONG KONG: According to the Chongqing Dagongbao, the Vichy French government has accepted the Japanese request to allow Japanese troops to pass through Vietnam to attack Yunnan Province in the north. Observers claim that this step was expected since Vietnam allowed the Japanese inspection team to investigate the situation there. (International News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>VICHY: Regarding the promotion of commerce between Japan and French Indochina, the French government sent a note to the Japanese government at the end of last week. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a reply from Japan today. It is reported that there are still some difficulties that have not been resolved, and negotiations are continuing.

<p>CHONGQING: Authoritative sources here today solemnly denied rumors that the Chinese army had crossed the Annam border, and emphasized that the Chinese government had not received any protests from French Indochina. (Haitong News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>VICHY: According to well-informed sources here, Japan's reply to France's proposal for resolving the Vietnam issue arrived here yesterday afternoon. French officials are reportedly very dissatisfied with the Japanese response, as Japan is demanding not only the establishment of naval and air bases in Vietnam, but also the use of railways to transport troops and joint management of Vietnam. (Haitong News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>CHONGQING: A Reuters dispatch from Vichy on the 14th of this month stated that fierce fighting was taking place between China and Japan along the Vietnamese border, but this had not been officially confirmed. A Haitong dispatch from Vichy on the 18th of this month stated that, according to reports from Hanoi, several Chinese army units were planning to cross the Vietnamese border but were repelled by French troops. A Domei dispatch from Vichy on the 19th of this month stated that, according to Hanoi, the Chinese army was attempting to invade Vietnam under the pretext of strengthening border defenses, and had concentrated five divisions of troops, deploying them at key military points along the Vietnamese border. Since August 7th, this Chinese army had attempted to enter Vietnamese territory, and the Vietnamese authorities had protested to China. The reporter, finding the matter too bizarre, visited an observer in diplomatic circles to inquire about the truth. The gentleman said that the purpose of such rumors was very simple and worthless to spell out. The Japanese had been coveting Vietnam for a long time. Taking advantage of France's exhaustion, they were pressuring the former Vietnamese authorities to accept their unreasonable demands. However, if they did not create an excuse, launching an attack rashly would be difficult to justify to the world. Therefore, the Japanese have recently been fabricating various false reports and trying to force the Vichy government to recognize these false reports as the basis for the Japanese army to send troops to Vietnam. From the above rumors, all originating from Vichy and promoted by Domei, the truth can be clearly understood. The Chinese government has solemnly denied the above rumors, and Reuters also firmly proved their inaccuracy on the 20th. In the future, the Japanese will inevitably have various propaganda, but if one can see through their background, all rumors will lose their effect. (23rd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Central Hubei Heavily Damaged</h3>
<p>BADONG: A unit of Japanese troops entrenched near Xiantao Town in central Hubei launched another attack on Xinlirenkou on the evening of the 18th, fighting fiercely with the Chinese army in the darkness for three hours.

<h3>Japanese Troops in Southern Shanxi Cut Off From Contact</h3>
<p>LUOYANG: The Japanese outer strongholds around Jincheng, such as Tianjingguan, Lanchezhen, Zhoucunzhen, and Ershilizhen, are constantly being attacked by the Chinese army, suffering heavy losses. They are now trapped in their strongholds and dare not move rashly. The Changjin Highway has also been actively attacked by the Chinese army, and much of the transportation has been destroyed. Japanese contact has been cut off, and the Chinese army is continuing to advance according to plan. (23rd)</p>
<p>XINGJI: A unit of Japanese infantry and cavalry, supported by aircraft, launched a westward attack on Pandao at dawn on the 19th from Fencheng, Gu Chengqian, Congshang, and other places. The Chinese army defended from a strong position and also used part of their force to threaten the Japanese flanks and rear, engaging in fierce fighting with the Japanese for an hour. The Japanese army was unable to withstand the pressure and retreated in disarray. (22nd)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops in Southern Guangdong Repeatedly Capture Strongholds</h3>
<p>YINGDE: Many Japanese strongholds in southern Guangdong have been repeatedly captured by the Chinese army in recent days, and the Japanese are restless. On the morning of the 15th, a unit of Japanese troops from Longquan advanced towards Gu Hu Tieqiao, which is under the jurisdiction of Xinhui, in an attempt to relieve the threat. After a fierce battle for three hours, the Japanese soldiers were defeated. (22nd)</p>
<h3>Soliciting Friends of the Wounded Soldiers: Enthusiastic Support</h3>
<p>CHONGQING: The enthusiastic response from overseas to the movement to solicit friends of wounded soldiers, and the situation of their donations, has been repeatedly reported previously. It is now learned that the Overseas Department of the Central Committee has received US$1,000 from the Honolulu Chinese Homeland Wounded Soldiers and Refugees Relief Association. The association has also organized a Friends of Wounded Soldiers Movement Committee, electing enthusiastic men and women as members to promote the movement immediately. It is expected that the results in the future will be remarkable. (22nd)</p>
<h3>Shaoguan Business Community Responds to Laboring the Troops</h3>

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Suffering from Malaria</h3>
<p>CHONGQING: Official sources recently stated that Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi is suffering from malaria but is expected to recover within a few days. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Rumors of National Government Relocation Completely Groundless</h3>
<p>CHONGQING: Rumors that the National Government is relocating from Chongqing are completely unfounded. The addresses of various government agencies have indeed changed due to being bombed by Japanese aircraft, but all important government departments are firmly staying here. They may be setting up new offices outside of Chongqing or in the suburbs due to the Japanese bombings, but they are all in the vicinity of Chongqing. Moreover, all major agencies will move back to Chongqing or its suburbs after the air raids are over. Although there was a bombing as late as October 20th last year, the number of air raids will likely decrease after October, as the winter climate is mostly foggy and rainy, and the raids will have to be postponed until April of the following year. The rumor that the government is moving to Xichang in southeastern Xikang is completely nonsense. The source of this rumor is mainly due to the government using Xichang as the center for developing the wealthy southeastern region of Xikang. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>National Government Issues Order to Commend Qian Hongye</h3>
<p>CHONGQING: On the 23rd, the National Government issued an order stating that Qian Hongye, Presiding Judge of the Shanghai First Special District Local Court, had served in the judiciary for thirteen years.

In recent years, as times became more difficult, he often expressed righteous opinions and did his best. He has now been assassinated, which is deeply regrettable. He should be commended by order, and a funeral expense of 2,000 yuan should be issued. In addition, the Judicial Yuan should follow the usual procedures and provide preferential compensation to comfort his loyal soul and encourage those who come after him. This is the order. (23rd)</p>

<h3>Scientists and China</h3>
<p>Political clarity, economic development, and even military warfare, in seeking to overcome the enemy and achieve results, the academic community should bear the responsibility, accounting for nine out of ten. This is especially evident in the recent European war. New types of weapons, sharp and swift, emerge endlessly, and those who create them and use them all judge their merits based on academic knowledge. If one cannot create these powerful weapons, even if there are abundant materials in front of them or hidden in the ground, they are just waste and rubbish. If one has these powerful weapons but cannot use them, they are just stubborn iron and rotten steel. Although they are the same human beings and the same materials, why is there such a clear difference in skill and such a wide gap in quality? This is simply because of the unevenness of academic standards. Therefore, in the past, when entering the battlefield, it was about strength and courage; now, it is about comparing advantages in the slightest of bullets. In the past, being able to write and respond was enough to enter the official career; now, one must have specialized knowledge to be able to take on partial political affairs. In the past, doing business was just about trading what one had for what one needed; now, one must first be familiar with the surpluses and deficits of international production and sales, and the changes in supply and demand, to be able to compete in the commercial arena. All of this requires practical knowledge to be effective. Moreover, the so-called knowledge is not something that can be put to use by simply reading a few books of principles. It has no constant teacher, no constant place, and constantly innovates with the times without knowing where the end lies. In the past, studying was generally in a static state for thousands of years. When studying principles, there was a warning against deviating from the classics. When studying the investigation of things and the extension of knowledge, there was a warning against indulging in objects and losing one's ambition. Those who have deeper achievements are secretly pleased with themselves, with the idea that the skill resides in the person and is lost when the person dies. Compared with the current academic world, which strives for perfection, and the scientific spirit of real evidence, it is not just two eras, but two worlds. The basic concepts and basic attitudes of studying in ancient and modern times are indeed completely different.</p>
<p>China lags far behind in modern science. It is not that there are no outstanding individuals who have created unique achievements, but because the general level is too low, there is a view that it is disconnected from general academics. Moreover, because general society ignores science and scientists, their highest functions are buried. At this great time, to strive for survival, we must mobilize the entire society to believe in science with the spirit of religious faith and catch up quickly, so that we can have a chance. To say that the wisdom of a large nation is not as good as others, to say that the past inferiority means that we must always lag behind in the future, is self-defeating talk. The progress of a country's academic knowledge truly depends on the efforts of those who devote themselves to academics, but it also depends on society urging them, rewarding them, supporting them, trusting them, and worshiping them, so that they can persevere and achieve their goals. Setting them up as role models and cultivating a good atmosphere, if general life becomes scientific, then this society is a modern society and this country is a modern country. If one listens to the radio at home and rides a motorcycle outside, this is a modern life. However, if one only loves to listen and only loves to ride, if the whole society loves to listen and loves to ride like this, if the whole society can only buy and enjoy it but cannot create it, let alone invent it, then the lag is very serious and the lack of scientific approach is very serious. Why is this so? Scientists are truly rare, and there is fundamentally no society that cultivates scientists. For forty or fifty years since the rise of new learning, primary and secondary schools have had introductory science courses. However, the traditional unscientific attitude has obscured them, the country and society have not made efforts to promote them, the atmosphere has suppressed them, and life has hindered them. On the contrary, all kinds of people who do not know what science is can also seek profit and gain, and those who study science and gain fame, profit, and even official positions may not have obtained them because of their study of science.</p>
<p>The achievements of scientists are not a matter of one day or one night, nor can they be achieved in one step. Cultivating scientists is the common responsibility of the country and society. Take the imperial examination era as an example: Jiangsu is known for having many top scholars, not because the people of Jiangsu are particularly outstanding, but because the economic conditions in Jiangsu Province are superior, which can nurture a literary atmosphere, and scholars can carefully study without worrying about being cold and hungry. Scientists are not comparable to talented scholars who study traditional essays. Seeking truth from facts is not something that can be forced, and everything emphasizes experimentation. Equipment, reagents, materials, constant effort, thoroughness of equipment, and the mental and financial resources to get up again after falling, if one is missing, progress cannot be made, or there may be failure at the last step. Therefore, to cultivate scientists, one must make those who are determined to study science have a stable life. This is true for national cultivation. In society, subsidies for the tuition fees of poor students are gradually becoming a trend, but grants for scientific undertakings, although heard of, are still rare. It is hoped that in the future, scholarship funds can also be heard of and rise up like a storm. As for today's industry, it is a product of modern science. In an era of rapid change, it is especially necessary to have scientists who bury themselves in hard work and catch up quickly, engaging in continuous improvement. Therefore, if factories are content to stand still and are willing to fail, then so be it. Otherwise, they should use the strength of one factory or one industry, and each year, take out a certain amount from their profits as scientific awards directly or indirectly related to their business. On the one hand, it is especially hoped that young people with ambition will gather their comrades and engage in research, creating many amateur scientists, so that society will be full of interest in science and will become a prevalent atmosphere, then the progress of Chinese science can be counted on the days to come. Those who usually enjoy the benefits of human science can also repay it with scientific achievements. "To bring welfare to the people and to create peace for all ages," the responsibilities of scientists cannot be ignored.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft in Three Batches Again Bombed Chongqing Yesterday, Causing Two Major Fires; Bombs Also Fell on the South Bank of the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>CHONGQING: At noon today, Japanese aircraft in three batches bombed Chongqing, causing two fires. Anti-aircraft guns gave them a heavy bombardment. The alert was issued here at 10:45 AM, followed by an emergency alert half an hour later. Just as residents were taking shelter in air-raid shelters, Japanese bombers appeared in the sky and dropped bombs on two districts some distance from Chongqing. Several bombs fell on the south bank of the Yangtze River. One of the places bombed was the Asia Oil Station, where a bomb hit houses downstream, causing a major fire. The other area was Tanzi Stone, located downstream where the Jialing River enters the Yangtze River. The British gunboat Falcon is currently moored at a point downstream of Tanzi Stone. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>CHONGQING: Chinese officials recently stated that, up to yesterday, Japanese aircraft have attacked Chongqing 38 times this year, costing the Japanese US$46 million. However, only 2,051 Chinese people have been killed by the bombing. On average, it costs the Japanese more than one ton of explosives to kill one person. According to the Air Raid Relief Association, in addition to the 2,051 killed, 3,479 Chinese people were injured, and 17,000 buildings and other structures were destroyed. A senior officer of the Chinese Air Force said that the massive amount of incendiary bombs dropped by Japanese aircraft on Monday and Tuesday proves that the Japanese aim to destroy the entire city. According to an investigation report, in these two air raids, no fewer than thirty foreign stores, homes, and other buildings in the city were destroyed by fire. On Monday, 190 bombers flew into the skies over Chongqing, and on Tuesday, 170 bombers were guided by a large number of reconnaissance planes. He also stated that the claim that Japanese fighter planes participated in the air raids was inaccurate, as Japanese fighter planes could not fly here from Hankou or Yuncheng, and the airport in Yichang had not been completed for full use. According to a survey by Reuters, no fewer than thirty foreign agencies and homes were burned or damaged. The great fires in the city on Monday and Tuesday have razed to the ground seventeen buildings, including the American Asia Insurance Company, the Asia Film Company, the American International Assurance Company, the Barry Company, the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company, Jardine Matheson, Butterfield &amp; Swire, Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada, the China Inland Mission, and the Methodist Episcopal Church. Chinese officials commented on the Japanese spokesman's claim that 3,300 aircraft had participated in the 38 attacks on Chongqing and that 2,500 tons of bombs had been dropped, saying that the Chinese had shot down 64 Japanese aircraft. These 64 Japanese aircraft alone have cost the Japanese US$32 million. In addition, the 448 Japanese airmen killed in the air raids have cost the Japanese another US$9 million. They also said that the gasoline consumed by the 3,300 Japanese aircraft amounted to US$4.3 million, and the 2,500 tons of bombs dropped were worth more than US$2 million. In total, the Japanese air raids on Chongqing have cost US$46 million. An Air Force officer recounted that the Scottish Bible Society, the Canadian Church Hospital, the Chongqing YMCA, and the residence of American businessman Xue Weier were completely burned down, and that several other places were damaged, including Jardine Engineering Corporation, Standard Oil, Reiss &amp; Co., China General Edison, Mobil Oil, British American Tobacco, and several agencies of the Associated Press, Reuters, Havas, DNB, and Reuters. The Chongqing Federation of Labor has issued a declaration stating that "The workers of Chongqing have witnessed everything and will never forget these tragic days. They will never forget this blood debt. We should obey the guidance of the government in order to retaliate." (AP, 23rd)</p>
<p>CHONGQING: The Chongqing Business Daily, a newspaper with a long history in this city, was also affected when Japanese aircraft bombed Chongqing yesterday, and the building was completely destroyed by fire. However, the newspaper has found a temporary location and will continue to publish as usual. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Spokesman for the Chinese Army Talks About Recent War Situation</h3>
<p>CHONGQING: A reporter recently met with a military spokesman to discuss the war situation this week. According to him, the Chinese army's attacks in southern Guangdong and northern Shandong this week have achieved great results. Zengcheng had long become an important Japanese stronghold, and its outer strongholds, such as Fuhe and Guantang, had strong fortifications. The Chinese army recently used all their strength day and night to completely recapture Fuhe and Guantang. The Japanese retreated to Zengcheng. On the Qidong side of northern Shandong, which is an important Japanese rear base, the Chinese army recently launched a surprise attack, even entering the city and thoroughly destroying various Japanese military facilities. The Japanese suffered heavy losses and were extremely panicked, as Qidong is deep in the Japanese rear and had been occupied by the Japanese for a long time. The sudden attack made them suspect that divine troops had descended from heaven. The reporter then asked about recent rumors that Japan was frequently transferring troops within its country, seemingly with the intention of sending reinforcements to China. The spokesman vaguely said that the Japanese have been fighting in China for three years and have suffered heavy casualties. The source of soldiers has now been exhausted, and there is no way to replenish them. Recently, they have newly established military districts in their country in order to strengthen control over the people and force them to enlist. This is a sign of their desperate situation. Maintaining the status quo is already difficult, so how can they send reinforcements? Therefore, the rumors are probably a misinterpretation of these measures. As for the Japanese aircraft's recent brutal bombing of various places, it further shows the Japanese's lack of wisdom. Japan's number of aircraft and replenishment capabilities are far inferior to Germany's, but they are blindly imitating them, indiscriminately bombing and wasting bombs, which is self-defeating. It can be seen that their military authorities are unwise. As for the indiscriminate bombing of innocent civilians, what military effect does it have? There are many foreign residents in Chongqing, and they must all be laughing at their shamelessness. (20th)</p>
<h3>Madame Chiang is Concerned About Refugees Bombed in Chongqing, Drives to Inspect Various Disaster Areas, and Gives Instructions to Staff at Tea and Porridge Stations</h3>

<p>CHONGQING: Madame Chiang is very concerned about the victims of the bombing in this city. This afternoon, after 5:00 PM, she drove to various disaster areas to inspect them. She saw the tea and porridge stations run by the New Life Movement Association, which were crowded with victims. Madame Chiang immediately got out of the car to express her condolences. The victims were all deeply grateful. Madame Chiang also gave instructions and encouragement to the staff at the tea and porridge stations. (23rd)</p>

The party ended in joyful dissipation at 6 o'clock. (23rd)</p>

<h3>The Conversation Between Craigie and Matsuoka: British Undersecretary Answers Questions from Members of Parliament</h3>
<p>London - Liberal Party MP Mander inquired of the Undersecretary in the House of Commons yesterday whether Sir Robert Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, had received a reply regarding his request to Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka for a clear explanation of Japan's future foreign policy direction, and whether the Undersecretary had made any comments regarding the withdrawal of British troops from Shanghai and other areas of the Far East. Butler replied in writing, "I am unaware that Craigie made such a direct request. However, Mr. Mander must have seen the Japanese government's statement on general policy issued on August 1 in the newspapers. I have no comments to make at this time on the second point in Mr. Mander's question." (Reuter's dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Soldier Li Rongde's Spirit of Sacrifice</h3>

This private first class participated in various battles in Xinxian, Shanxi, and Nanchang, Jiangxi, experienced countless battles, and was wounded several times. His spirit of sacrificing and fighting for the country is readily apparent. Furthermore, his ability to economize on food and clothing and donate all of his savings to help refugees in the rear is even more commendable. It is reported that the National Relief Commission has specially commended him. (Dispatch of the 23rd)</p>

<h3>German Long-Range Guns Bombard the Southeastern Coast of England, British Air Force Launches Massive Bombing Raid on Calais Area, German Planes Bomb Suburbs of London Again</h3>
<p>London - German long-range guns on the northern coast of France began a 45-minute bombardment of the southeastern corner of England yesterday evening. However, British bombers immediately retaliated with a whirlwind bombing of the gun battery. Nevertheless, in the minutes before the British counterattack, more than 20 shells weighing over a ton each landed and exploded in the Dover area of Kent. It is reported that some platoons of the German artillery squadron, consisting of four guns, were completely annihilated and others were heavily damaged after the most intense British bombing. Dozens of British fighters launched a large-scale counterattack on Calais and Boulogne, where anti-aircraft batteries fired intensely. Smoke and flames rising into the sky could be seen from the British coast. The bombardment of the southeastern coast of England by guns located 20 to 30 miles away resulted in loss of life and property. Many houses were reduced to rubble, like eggshells being crushed. Among the remains of the dead, several women and clergy were found, seemingly a prelude to the long-awaited invasion of England. At the same time, it was reported that German planes again flew over various parts of England and Wales, bombing everywhere. Prior to the German artillery bombardment of the British coast, a total of 30 German planes, three of which were shot down by the British. According to reports, German 14-inch long-range guns had earlier bombarded British escort ships in the English Channel for 54 minutes, firing a total of 108 shells. Later, German planes also attacked the escort ships, but none of the British ships were damaged. (International News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>London Harbour - German heavy guns on the French coast bombarded the southeastern coast of England last night. "Observers along the Channel saw flashes of gunfire and heard shells whistling through the air before exploding with a roar. More than a dozen shells fell. Amidst the artillery fire were the sounds of anti-aircraft guns and exploding bombs, as British Air Force fighters were launching a fierce attack on the German gun batteries. The British Air Force attacked twice, the second time even more intensely. During the initial British attack, the enemy guns were temporarily silent, but the gunfire soon resumed. The damage caused was considerable, but casualties were light. A church was hit and collapsed, but residents had already entered air-raid shelters, so there were few casualties." (Reuter's dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>A Town on the Southeastern Coast of England - German artillery on the French coast of the English Channel began bombarding the coastal area of Kent in southeastern England at 9 p.m. last night (6 a.m. Shanghai summer time today) and continued to create an artillery barrage at 11 p.m. (8 a.m. Shanghai summer time this morning). British coastal batteries also returned fire across the Channel. The entire Channel coast was shaken by the intense artillery fire. Large shells screamed through the air and bombarded England. Before 10 p.m. yesterday, German long-range guns bombarded 18 British escort ships in the Channel for 80 minutes. The reporter saw the escort ships enter Dover harbor and then head east. British fighters flew overhead to provide cover, while other fighters patrolled between the French coast and the warships. The German artillery bombarded the ships for 40 minutes, but the ships continued on their course without changing direction. Small boats and British destroyers completely obscured the ships with smoke. Later, dive bombers took off from the French coast and began attacking the escort ships. The sea was filled with white spray hundreds of feet high. The warships and merchant ships responded with anti-aircraft fire to prevent the bombers from making low-level bombing runs. British fighters then engaged the enemy planes in fierce combat. Experts here estimate that the German gun batteries were firing at a rate of ten rounds per minute, with a total of 80 to 100 shells fired. However, it is understood that none of the ships were hit. It is believed that at least two German bombers were heavily damaged. (United Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Berlin - German coastal artillery units conducted firing exercises yesterday to determine the range of their guns. Many guns have been deployed along the English Channel and the Atlantic coast. The artillery fire boomed for hours. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>British Convoy Sails Unhindered</p>
<p>London - Authoritative observers believe that the German long-range artillery bombardment of England further demonstrates the signs of German intentions for a future invasion of England. Although the British convoy was bombarded, it is still sailing in the Channel, which contradicts German claims. The bombardment has clearly failed to disrupt British shipping. British destroyers still maintain control of the English coast. The general public suspects the inconsistency between the two sides' statements, but it is believed that the victor's news is reliable. There is no doubt that in the Battle of Britain, Britain is winning, so British intelligence is more accurate. (International News Service dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>London - The following are the details of the German artillery positions on the French coast firing on a British convoy sailing in the Channel yesterday. The convoy, consisting of several merchant ships and their escorts, was approaching a harbor in the Channel at about 10 a.m. when suddenly loud artillery fire was heard from the French coast. Soon four columns of water were seen erupting upwards in the sea. The cities along the British Channel coast were also shaken by the artillery fire. A Reuters reporter who was standing on a rocky hill observing the situation estimated that the Germans were firing one round per minute. The shells landed in the sea and were clearly visible. Subsequently, the artillery fire became more frequent, about one round every half minute. Reuters personnel in London also clearly heard the artillery fire over the telephone while receiving this information. As the convoy passed through a harbor, the German heavy artillery fire between Calais and Boulogne became even more intense. The shells landed about 20 miles from the French coast. The escort ships immediately maneuvered around the ships they were protecting and laid down a smoke screen. After about half an hour, the bombardment was a waste of ammunition and had no effect. The convoy continued to advance without showing any sign of fear. At that time, a single enemy plane appeared in the sky over the Channel, probably a reconnaissance plane acting as eyes and ears for the German artillery positions, but it was quickly driven away by British planes. Suddenly, the sound of engines was heard, and a squadron of British fighters appeared in the sky. The convoy slowly sailed up the Channel. The German artillery on the coast near Calais then resumed its intense bombardment, the intensity of which did not diminish. The bombardment only began to weaken after the convoy passed Dover and headed towards Deal. The entire convoy safely passed through the Channel 80 minutes after the Germans opened fire, and no ships were hit. The bombardment was clearly a failure. The flashes of gunfire indicated the location of their artillery positions. A resident of the southeastern coast described the bombardment as follows: "Three of our warships laid down a black smoke screen and rushed to rescue the convoy. At that time, the sea was filled with thick smoke, and the shells fell, spraying seawater hundreds of feet high. The convoy was in a dangerous situation, but it continued to sail slowly and without panic. A large crowd stood on the rocks and beaches, watching the attack from afar. The convoy was also attacked from the air by enemy planes, but they were driven away by intense anti-aircraft fire and hastily dropped several heavy bombs, all of which landed in the sea."

<p>British Planes Raid German Military Zone at Night</p>
<p>London - On Wednesday, British planes once again ventured out in bad weather to carry out night raids, heavily bombarding German military targets and continuing to disrupt the striking power of the German war machine. According to a communiqué from the Air Ministry, the main targets of the British raids were vital railway hubs, airfields, and oil refineries. Only one British plane failed to return. Oil refineries in Magdeburg and oil depots in Hanover were bombed. Airfields in Caen and Abbeville were attacked, and bombs hit runways and hangars, causing explosions and fires. Searchlight batteries were also destroyed. Airfields on Quakenbrück near Hanover and Texel Island were also bombed. British planes also bombed vital railway hubs in the Ruhr and Rhine regions. A military supply train between Homburg and Verdun was also bombed as it entered a tunnel. (Reuter's dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>German Planes Appear Over London</p>
<p>London - This morning, London once again became the target of enemy air raids. Air raid sirens sounded loudly, enemy planes appeared in the sky, and the residents heard the sound of anti-aircraft guns. Searchlights were busily searching for enemy planes. According to a joint communiqué from the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Home Security, several bombs fell in the suburbs of London, destroying several houses and a cinema, and causing a few casualties. According to reports, at least four bombs fell in a certain place in the suburbs, but only a few people were slightly injured. Two of the bombs landed on the road, one hit the rear of a bank building, and another landed in a garden. It is reported that one of the bombs nearly hit an apartment building where 200 people were sleeping. Another communiqué from the Air Ministry stated that enemy planes were active over British airspace last night. Several bombs were dropped in several areas of southeastern and northeastern Scotland. Last night and this morning, enemy planes bombed a city in southern Wales, dropping several bombs and injuring several people. Several high-explosive bombs were dropped on a village, causing some casualties. Last night, three cities in southwestern England were attacked. Twelve bombs fell near one of them, causing minimal damage. A German plane dropped several incendiary bombs in a certain area in the southeast. One landed in the city center, setting a house on fire, but it was quickly extinguished. Another German plane dropped several bombs on two cities in northeastern England, causing some material damage. (Reuter's dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>German Reconnaissance Planes Continue Activity</p>
<p>Berlin - According to a supplementary war report released by German military sources, German reconnaissance planes continued their activity yesterday and attacked 15 British airfields. Seven British planes were lost, and six German planes did not return. Factories and arsenals in Beauvais and Breteuil were hit. Dockyards and harbors in Southampton and Bridlington were also bombed. An aircraft factory near London was also hit. German bombers hit the arsenal in Birmingham and the motor factory in Coventry, causing heavy damage and starting a large fire. An airfield near Leamington was also bombed, and many planes were destroyed on the field. The Martlesham Heath airfield was destroyed, and many planes, barracks, and ammunition depots were also hit. British planes also attacked various parts of Germany, but there was no damage. Several civilian houses in Ghent, which is in the German-occupied area, were bombed by British planes, causing many civilian casualties. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Germany Announces Air Force Results</p>
<p>Berlin - This afternoon, the German military report claimed that German planes had sunk four enemy merchant ships in the sea near Berwick. The airfield at Manston was bombed, causing heavy damage. Numerous air battles occurred over southeastern England, with German planes repeatedly gaining the upper hand.

British planes dropped bombs on western Germany last night, with no significant effects. Several civilians were injured and one house was destroyed, with several others damaged in one city. Yesterday, the enemy lost eleven planes and two barrage balloons. Two German planes were missing. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Göring Issues Berlin Air Defense Order</p>
<p>Berlin - German Air Force Commander-in-Chief Göring issued an order stating that enemy planes have recently attempted to attack or fly into Berlin, so it is necessary to issue advance warnings to prepare. However, when an air raid alert is issued in Berlin, it does not necessarily mean that bombs will fall in the city of Berlin. Citizens only need to seek refuge in air-raid shelters or basements when the activity of searchlights or anti-aircraft guns indicates that enemy planes are approaching Berlin. In any case, people are not allowed to stand in the streets. Those who do not seek shelter in a safe place are simply inviting trouble for themselves. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>British Air Force Bombs Italian Fleet in Libya, Communiqué Claims Several Italian Ships Destroyed, Alexandria Raided</h3>
<p>Cairo - A communiqué from the British Air Force here this morning stated that when British planes made low-level bombing runs on Italian warships docked in Bomba harbor in Libya, they dropped bombs and destroyed two Italian submarines, one destroyer, and one submarine tender.

<h3>Rumors of Italy Pressuring Greece to Repeal British Guarantee, Greek Government Holds Special Meeting</h3>
<p>London - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that there has been no official confirmation here of rumors that Italy has issued a 24-hour ultimatum to Greece demanding that it repeal the British guarantee. This guarantee was announced in the House of Commons on April 13, 1939, stating that in the event of any action clearly threatening the independence of Greece and deemed important by the Greek government, requiring it to resist with all its national strength, the British government would feel obligated to immediately assist Greece with all its power. According to official statements, Britain is now firmly maintaining this guarantee, and that the rumors that Britain has occupied Corfu are completely unfounded and considered to be Italian propaganda. (Reuter's dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>London - According to a report from the Yugoslav capital by the "Daily Telegraph" correspondent, Italy has given Greece 24 hours to renounce the British guarantee of assistance to Greece in the event of an attack. According to reliable sources, Italy warned Greece that if it refused to renounce its agreement with Britain, a conflict would ensue immediately. Recently, the "Daily Mail" Athens reporter reported that crowds of Greeks in Crete protested loudly at the Italian consulate after hearing that an Italian submarine had sunk the Greek destroyer "Helle" last week. (United Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Athens - This morning, King George summoned government leaders to hold a special meeting to discuss the concentration of Italian troops on the Albanian border. At the same time, reports were received that Italian and British warships were patrolling off the coast of Crete. The special meeting lasted for more than half an hour. Those present included Prime Minister Metaxas, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Ministers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and the Chief of the General Staff. The meeting was held at 2:15 a.m. (10 a.m. Shanghai Summer Time this morning) at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (United Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Argentine President Suddenly Resigns, Cabinet Also Submits Resignation Due to Corruption Scandal</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires - Argentine President Dr. Ortiz resigned yesterday afternoon. Ortiz was elected on September 5, 1937, and took office on February 20 of the following year, with a six-year term. Ortiz has been in poor health, and his duties have long been carried out by Vice President Castillo. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Buenos Aires - All Argentine cabinet members submitted their resignations to Acting President Castillo yesterday afternoon, but before the Legislative Assembly meets to discuss the president's resignation, the ministers, although resigned, will remain in office temporarily. If the Legislative Assembly approves President Ortiz's resignation, Vice President Castillo will legally succeed him until the end of the term in 1944. The reason for this cabinet crisis is that the Minister of Finance and the Minister of War embezzled huge sums of money in the construction of the Palermo airport, so the President resigned to take responsibility. The fate of the Cabinet awaits decision in Argentina. (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Investigation into the Assassination of Trotsky, Mexican Authorities Investigate the Cause</h3>
<p>Mexico City - After the assassination of former Soviet communist leader Trotsky, an autopsy was performed yesterday in accordance with Mexican law. The assassin, Jackson, intended to commit suicide, and the police have taken precautions to keep him detained in the hospital. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Mexico City - Since the assassination of exiled Soviet revolutionary Trotsky, the Mexican authorities have been doing their best to investigate the terrorist activities of the Soviet secret police. An unofficial source claimed, "We are convinced that the assassin, Jackson (that is, Van den Dreissche), is a close confidant of Stalin. We also believe that he was involved in the attempted assassination on May 24 last year. That night, he may have been the one who ordered Hart, Trotsky's guard, to open the door to Trotsky's bedroom. He may have directly participated in the assassination, but he must have been the one who planned it." Trotsky's guards said, "If the police can get a confession from Jackson, we will be able to learn the whole truth. We need his confession, which is why we didn't kill him at the time."

<h3>Large Number of Overseas Ambassadors and Consuls Recalled: Japanese Foreign Policy to Change; Outer Provinces Reject Pro-British and American Faction Members; Kensuke Horiuchi Also Among Those Recalled</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka yesterday ordered the recall of forty Japanese diplomats, including five ambassadors, nineteen ministers, five counselors, and eleven consuls-general. In addition, there will be major changes in the personnel of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The recalled ambassadors include Kensuke Horiuchi, Ambassador to the United States; Toshihiko Taketomi, Ambassador to Turkey; Renzo Sawada, Ambassador to France; Kazue Kuwashima, Ambassador to Brazil; and Masaaki Horita, Ambassador-at-Large. This large-scale reshuffle is unprecedented in Japanese diplomatic history. Observers believe that under the cooperation of Matsuoka and Ohashi, Japanese foreign policy will undergo drastic changes. The newly appointed Acting Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Tadashi Ohashi, told Japanese reporters yesterday, "Japanese diplomacy has entered a new era. All talented individuals will be promoted. New appointments for diplomatic officials will not be limited to officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Journalists may also be appointed." Ohashi stated that the successors to the recalled diplomats would be announced within a week. It is reported that Colonel Hashimoto, leader of the Japanese Youth Party, has accepted an invitation from Japanese Prime Minister Konoe to join the preparatory committee for a new Japanese political structure. (United Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The "Asahi Shimbun" stated in an editorial today that Japan will adopt a harsh diplomatic policy toward Britain and the United States, which can be seen in the expulsion of pro-American and pro-British elements from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the diplomatic corps. The newspaper stated that Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka intends to completely reorganize the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, appointing a "collection of geniuses" and "expelling those within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who are considered to belong to the so-called British and American factions" as steps to adjust Japanese foreign policy. Commenting on Foreign Minister's "recall of forty Japanese diplomatic officials," the newspaper stated that in the future, foreign diplomatic officials and officials in various departments of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may be further reshuffled. The newspaper said that Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka will appoint a collection of geniuses from within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and from non-official sources. The "Asahi Shimbun" also stated that the recall of Japanese Ambassador to Washington, Kensuke Horiuchi, was inevitable, as he had suffered a diplomatic setback a year ago when the United States abolished the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty. Regarding the Far East, Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka will recall two consuls, Keinosuke Fujii in Beijing and Miura in "Manchukuo," as well as two consuls-general, Yoshida in Manila and Miyakawa in Vladivostok. (United Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Suma Stated Yesterday That It Was Due to Administrative Needs</p>
<p>Tokyo: Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma, while receiving news reporters today, mentioned that Foreign Minister Matsuoka had redistributed diplomatic personnel yesterday, recalling five ambassadors, nineteen ministers, five counselors, and eleven consuls-general stationed abroad, saying that this was a routine matter, but that it was intended to introduce new people into diplomatic affairs to bring a new atmosphere. The recall of forty representatives had nothing to do with their competence or merit, and even less to do with the relations between Japan and the countries where they were stationed. Japan will have diplomatic relations with all the countries from which diplomatic representatives have been recalled, and arrangements have already been completed to ensure that there will be no difficulties or obstacles in Japan's dealings with these countries. Some of the vacancies will be filled immediately, while others will be filled within a month or two. The spokesman hinted that there were several vacancies that would not be filled, but would be handled by ministers stationed in other countries serving concurrently as chargés d'affaires. However, everything would depend on the development of the overall world situation in the next two months. When asked if the vacancy for the US ambassador would be filled, the spokesman replied that the position would be filled immediately, but that it might take some time to obtain "consent" for the new ambassador. Subsequently, someone asked whether any government had been consulted regarding the appointment of a new ambassador or minister plenipotentiary. The spokesman declined to answer, saying that this was not proper diplomatic practice. The spokesman reiterated that there was no special reason for the Foreign Minister's recall of forty diplomats, but that it was unavoidable due to higher administrative needs. When asked whether this move was a prelude to Japan's redetermination of its foreign policy, the spokesman gave the same answer as before. The spokesman then mentioned the issue of General Koiso, saying that everything would be clear within a week, and that General Koiso seemed to be seriously deciding his attitude towards the position of head of the commission to the Dutch East Indies during this week. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Washington Closely Watching New Developments in Japanese Diplomacy</p>
<p>Washington: Political circles here are puzzled by the reshuffle in the Japanese diplomatic corps. Some well-informed sources believe that the recall of forty Japanese diplomats may be a "startling move" to attract the attention of the Japanese people. Others refused to criticize the reshuffle in the diplomatic corps, with most officials commenting that changes in diplomatic personnel are often an internal matter for any country and are not relevant to other countries. When Foreign Minister Matsuoka first took office, there were general expectations of major changes in the Japanese diplomatic corps, due to Matsuoka's strong methods and the declaration to promote the "Greater East Asia" doctrine. However, a complete reshuffle did not materialize, as the entire Japanese diplomatic corps was almost entirely enthusiastic about promoting any policy of Tokyo. This impression makes people here believe that the changes in Japanese diplomatic personnel will only have minor changes on US-Japan relations. Well-informed people here refused to acknowledge that the new Japanese diplomatic reshuffle was merely an internal matter. Most non-official people here do not believe that Japan has definitely decided to join hands with the Rome-Berlin Axis. They claim that Japan may take a cautious attitude towards ventures in French Indochina and the Dutch East Indies until the outcome of the British war is more certain. The Japanese Embassy here has confirmed that Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Kensuke Horiuchi, has been ordered to return to Tokyo. The date of his return has not been decided. Embassy officials declined to comment or speculate on the meaning of the recall. The Japanese Minister to Canada and the Consuls-General in New York, Chicago, and San Francisco have all been ordered to return home. (United Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>US and Canada Form Committee to Study Joint Defense Issues; First Meeting Scheduled for Monday; US President Allows Old Ships to Be Given to Britain</h3>

According to the above list, the last two members on the US side will alternate their attendance, one attending discussions on naval issues, and the other attending discussions on land and air force issues. The first meeting of the committee will be held in Ottawa on Monday. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt, along with Secretary of War Stimson, Secretary of the Navy Knox, Undersecretary of State Welles, and Attorney General Jackson, discussed the issue of leasing Atlantic bases to Britain yesterday. The difficulty regarding the transfer of overage destroyers has not yet been fully resolved. It is reported that the President favors the transfer, but the attitude of Congress is still an obstacle. It is desirable to avoid lengthy legislative procedures for this matter, but a method of avoiding the need for congressional approval has not yet been found. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Britain Denies Alliance with the United States; Anglo-American Relations Growing Closer; Japan Expresses Concern</h3>
<p>London: According to a statement from authoritative sources in London to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent, the rumor that the British government intends to conclude a military alliance with the United States, and that the current talks between Canada and the United States are merely the beginning of a complete military agreement, is completely unfounded and should be firmly denied. Washington also denied the same rumor yesterday, dismissing it as nonsense. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Tokyo dispatch: All major newspapers here this morning published commentaries on the growing closeness between Britain and the United States. The newspapers believe that Prime Minister Churchill's speech in the House of Commons the day before yesterday, as well as the meeting between Roosevelt and King, are sufficient to show that Britain and the United States have become increasingly close. Many newspaper editorials believe that although the islands Britain is currently leasing to the United States are limited to the Atlantic, there may come a day when British territories in the Pacific may also be leased to the United States. The "Asahi Shimbun" pointed out that if Britain intends to lease its Pacific territories, such as the Bismarck Archipelago and other places in Australia, to the United States, Japan would express great concern. "Nichinichi Shimbun" stated that in order to extricate itself from its own crisis, Britain is attempting to disrupt the status quo in the Pacific, and Japan must firmly oppose this. "Yomiuri Shimbun" stated that although the islands that Britain is currently leasing to the United States do not include the Pacific, it is a natural trend that the scope of the lease will extend to the Pacific in the future as the situation develops. In particular, Vancouver and Victoria are located at the throat of the North Pacific, and the result of the US-Canada agreement will also make them US air force bases. At the same time, the US's proposed military road through Canada, if extended to Alaska, will make Alaska and the Bering Islands like Hawaii and become the US's forward air force bases, and the distance between them and the US mainland will be shortened. From this point of view, the Anglo-American and US-Canadian agreements not only affect the situation in Europe, but also have a significant impact on Japan's future. (Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Important Historical Anniversary: First Anniversary of the German-Soviet Pact; Political and Economic Cooperation Between the Two Countries Lays the Foundation for Permanent Friendship</h3>
<p>Moscow: August 23, 1940, marks the first anniversary of the signing of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact. "Izvestia" published a commentary entitled "An Important Historical Anniversary," stating that "war provocateurs deliberately stirred up Soviet-German animosity, but since the signing of the Non-Aggression Pact, this animosity has ended. At the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Stalin issued a serious warning to all war provocateurs who attempted to involve the Soviet Union in war for their own benefit. At that time, British and North American newspapers invented a German "seizure" of Soviet Ukraine "plan," but it was exposed by Stalin. Stalin said, "The purpose of this clamor seems to be to arouse Soviet animosity towards Germany, to poison the atmosphere at the time, and to provoke war with Germany for no reason." In the same report, Stalin clearly elaborated on Soviet foreign policy, saying, "We seek peace and seek to increase trade relations with all countries. This is our position. If other countries maintain the same relations with us and do not attempt to infringe on our interests, we will adhere to this position." Based on this policy, the Soviet Union immediately accepted the German proposal and began negotiations on a non-aggression pact. During the negotiations, both sides acted according to their respective fundamental national interests. Molotov said at the Fourth Congress of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, "History proves that Soviet-German war and animosity are harmful to both sides. As a result of the 1914-1918 war, the Soviet Union and Germany suffered the most losses. Therefore, the interests of the Soviet and German peoples do not lie in mutual animosity. On the contrary, the Soviet and German peoples need peaceful relations." The Soviet-German Pact, signed on August 23, 1939, was not only an important turning point in the history of Soviet-German relations, but also an important turning point for the whole of Europe and the world. The pact is truly the most important document in diplomatic relations in recent decades. (To be continued) (TASS dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Berlin: German newspapers reviewed the effects of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact in political, economic, and military aspects on the first anniversary of the pact. The "Essen National Daily" declared that Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Non-Aggression Pact on August 23, 1939. This simple text stipulated the relations between the signatory countries and created an atmosphere of peace, allowing Germany and the Soviet Union to cooperate in all aspects. The leaders of the two countries have placed the people of the two countries on a foundation of honesty. The German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact was signed on the eve of the European war, which naturally had an important impact on the military aspect, and the cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union in the economic aspect was also of great significance. The signing of the transportation agreement on August 23, 1939, and the re-signing of various economic agreements on February 11, 1940, were not accidental consequences. The German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact has established the friendly relations between the two countries and laid the cornerstone for various agreements. Germany is no longer worried about the rear in its war against Western European countries, while the Soviet Union can also avoid being drawn into the vortex of war. Both Germany and the Soviet Union have obtained various economic benefits, and the construction work in Europe is also possible. The "German Foreign Policy News" declared that the Soviet Union, in view of the unrest in Europe, eliminated the possibility of disputes with intelligent action. The results of the first year of German-Soviet cooperation have proved that the signatories of the Non-Aggression Pact have realized their hopes. The Soviet Union has eliminated the unstable and dissatisfied factors in the west, and Germany has satisfied its needs through the exchange of goods between Germany and the Soviet Union. Germany and the Soviet Union have the determination to cooperate, and over the past year, they have solved various problems in a proper way. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Japan Strictly Controls Rice; To Be Implemented from September 1st</h3>
<p>Tokyo dispatch: The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry announced that from September 10th, Japan will implement a special white rice control ordinance, which will enable the government to completely control the purchase and distribution of the nation's main food, white rice. According to "Miyako Shimbun," according to the new ordinance, the public cannot obtain white rice without going through the government-controlled distribution agency. The purchase and distribution of white rice has been unified by the Imperial Agricultural Association and the Japan Rice Company, and control is implemented in the producing areas, which can eliminate the complaints from residents of producing areas that it is easier to obtain rice than in urban consumption centers. From now on, all rice producers, whether landlords or tenants, can only sell rice to the Imperial Agricultural Association and cannot sell it to others. Only the government and the Japan Rice Company, which is controlled by the government, have the right to collect rice. Therefore, landlords living in the city cannot obtain the rice produced in their own fields, and even the rice eaten by farmers in the producing areas must be distributed to them by rice sales companies or merchants recognized by the authorities. The transportation of rice between counties is also controlled, so that farmers cannot send rice to their children studying in the city, and even bartering rice is prohibited. The severity of this ordinance is evident. (Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Japan Plans to Mobilize Ten Thousand Monks; To Encourage People to Seek Divine Blessings</h3>

<h3>Strengthening Defense in Central District; Armored Cars Deployed This Morning; Rifles Issued and Training Provided Overnight; British Light Cavalry Also Called Up to Assist</h3>
<p>The Hongkou West District of the British Defense Area of the Public Concession is currently temporarily defended by approximately 300 members of the A Company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps (i.e., the British Company). However, the members are all volunteers, and they all have other legitimate occupations that they cannot ignore. Therefore, the Public Concession authorities have considered calling up the B Company (i.e., the American Company) for rotation. It was learned from sources related to the Concession authorities yesterday that the American Company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps has not yet been ordered to be called up because the Japanese side still opposes any company other than the British Company of the Volunteer Corps defending the Hongkou West District. Therefore, the Public Concession authorities had to issue an order again at 5:00 PM yesterday, calling up a squadron of armored cars from the British Company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps for deployment starting this morning to remedy the current difficulties of the A Company. In addition, the British Light Cavalry of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Headquarters will also be called up. As for the B Company, it has not yet been called up to assist because the Japanese side has not yet agreed.</p>
<p>Armored Car Squadron Ordered to Mobilize</p>
<p>Since approximately 600 British defense troops withdrew from Shanghai starting at 11:30 AM yesterday, the A Company has felt inadequate in its defensive duties. The Concession authorities specially issued an order from Commander Hempel of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps at 5:00 PM last night, calling up the armored car squadron from the Volunteer Corps to assist. The armored car squadron is also a British unit, but it has never belonged to the A Company and is incorporated into the Volunteer Corps of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. The original quota was 169 men, but there are many vacancies, and there are currently only over 90 men.</p>
<p>Rifles Issued Overnight, Taking Over Defense This Morning</p>
<p>The British armored car squadron is trained in armored car warfare, and is relatively less proficient in foot combat than in tank combat. Moreover, the weapons they usually use, in addition to the Lewis machine guns on the armored cars, are only seven-inch revolvers. For this reason, the Volunteer Corps Headquarters specially summoned them last night to issue rifles and rifle ammunition, and the instructors of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Headquarters temporarily taught them the necessary techniques of foot troops in the Public Works Department barracks. They are scheduled to be deployed starting this morning to assist the A Company.</p>
<h3>Arnold Returns Home Early; Leaves Shanghai on the 5th of Next Month</h3>
<p>The American Association of Shanghai has scheduled a farewell banquet for Arnold, the US Commercial Attaché in China, for the evening of September 5th. It has been learned that the date has been changed and moved to the evening of September 4th because Mr. Arnold has changed his return schedule and will leave Shanghai on September 5th, planning to take the China Clipper to the United States.</p>
<h3>Vietnamese Exports Still Use French Franc Standard; US Dollar Settlement Cancelled</h3>
<p>After the Vietnamese authorities stipulated that all export goods should be settled in US dollars or Dutch currency, it was recently reported in transportation circles that the settlement in US dollars or Dutch currency by the Vietnamese authorities was once implemented, but has now been cancelled and the French franc has been restored as the standard. As for the reason for this cancellation, it is said to be due to British opposition, as Britain wants to maintain its gold pound standard and does not want to buy Vietnamese products in foreign currencies.</p>
<h3>Military Strategist Discusses the European War</h3>
<p>A military strategist here said that Germany has already missed the opportunity to defeat Britain. If the German army had captured Sedan on May 18th and then gone straight to Paris, then Paris could have fallen one or two weeks earlier. If the German army had occupied Paris and then attacked Britain, then Britain's best land forces would have been in France, and they would have been less prepared to deal with a coastal surprise attack, making it easier to succeed. Delaying until now, Britain has gained air superiority, and its control of the sea and its land defenses have also made significant progress, so the difficulties will only increase in the future.</p>

<h3>British Ambassador Kerr Regularly Travels to Hong Kong to Fly to Chongqing; May Change to the President Coolidge; French Ambassador Cosme to Go to New Capital Next Month</h3>
<p>British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, returned to Shanghai from Weihaiwei with his wife, etc., and has been residing at his private residence on Dunsing Road. Because it is currently high summer, he has been living a quiet life with little contact with the outside world, except for attending the British military review ceremony and the farewell dinner for Major General Simmons. Now that summer is passing and autumn is approaching, the Ambassador has decided to leave Shanghai by boat on the day after tomorrow (the 26th) to Hong Kong and then fly to Chongqing, and the journey is expected to arrive on September 1st.

<h3>The Second Batch of British Troops Embarked Yesterday; Full Withdrawal Expected Soon; Enthusiastic Farewell with Music Along the Way; Officers' Families to be Sent to Australia</h3>
<p>The first batch of British defense troops, approximately 300, ordered to withdraw from Shanghai, boarded the Deisen Liner on the 21st and departed on the morning of the 12th. Yesterday morning, a second batch of 600 British troops from the East Surrey Regiment marched from the Jing'an Temple Road along Nanjing Road to Hongkou to embark. Around 9:00 AM, the troops left their camp in western Shanghai and marched to the Racecourse, where they rested for a while.</p>
<p>American Troops Played Music to See Them Off</p>
<p>At that time, the Fourth Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps also arrived to see them off. At 11:00 AM, they set off together. The U.S. Marine Corps band played military music along the way, with clear and melodious tunes. Pedestrians lined the streets, standing and waving their hats, cheering and bidding farewell. The British troops also nodded and smiled in response. Some of the shops along the street displayed the British flag. When the British troops marched through the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road, a patriotic Briton scattered colorful confetti from the rooftop. When the British troops turned onto the Bund and arrived in front of the British Consulate, the U.S. Marine Corps band played a farewell song, paying their respects. The British troops then marched across the Waibaidu Bridge, under the salute of the White Russian merchant corps guarding the bridgehead, and entered Hongkou to board their ship at the wharf.</p>
<p>Recruited British Soldiers Depart Together</p>
<p>According to a reporter's inquiry yesterday, the remaining British troops stationed here will be withdrawn successively over the next three days. By next Monday (the 26th), all British troops stationed in this city will be completely withdrawn. It is understood that there are currently five British ships prepared to transport British soldiers from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Singapore. In addition, about 200 British expatriates who have registered to join the British military service will leave Shanghai next Monday. The British soldiers recruited in this city will travel together with the Seaforth Highlanders regiment, which is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the "Narkunda" Liner on Sunday afternoon. The British Shipping Company's "Danda" Liner will depart today, carrying the families of British soldiers to Australia. Furthermore, the soldiers of the Seaforth Highlanders regiment guarding the British Consulate on the Bund were also withdrawn yesterday morning. It is rumored that the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department will send Indian constables to the British Consulate starting today to take over guard duties.</p>
<p>Withdrawal Costs Approximately One Million Yuan</p>
<p>Preparations for the British troop withdrawal have been underway for more than ten days. Jardine Matheson's requisitioned ships, Ewo, Arnhold, and Ewo, were specially painted in Shanghai, and the cabins were completely renovated. In addition to the original berths, more than a thousand temporary straw mattresses were custom-made. These straw mattresses were similar to Simmons mattresses in style and were very elaborate. The ship's dining hall was also improved, with new large dining tables made uniformly. The menu for lunch, dinner, and snacks were all pre-arranged and different each day. Living and dining on board were more comfortable than in the barracks. It is said that as many as 2,000 cases of beer were prepared, and each soldier was provided with HK$1 per day for food expenses. This price was the standard rate for previous British troop rotations by ship. The ship's stewards believed that the menu set for this trip was richer than that set for routine troop rotations. Moreover, with rising prices recently, they requested an increase of HK$0.50 from the company. The Shanghai office said that this matter belonged to the Hong Kong office and should be requested from Hong Kong. Therefore, the stewards planned to request it again after arriving in Hong Kong. All expenses, calculated in legal tender, could reach one million yuan.</p>
<h3>Three Hurricanes in the Pacific</h3>
<p>Hurricanes in the Pacific Ocean are occurring one after another.

<h3>Summary of Important News</h3>
<p>Packages to Tianjin and Beiping: The Parcel Delivery Group of the Shanghai Postal Administration announced yesterday that due to congestion and limited space in the large parcel group, all large packages to Tianjin and Beiping will be temporarily accepted by the Parcel Delivery Group starting from the 24th of this month. To ensure clarity, Counter No. 9 will be dedicated to receiving packages for Tianjin, Counter No. 10 will be dedicated to receiving packages for Beiping, and other miscellaneous goods will be received by Counters No. 6, 7, and 8.

<p>Coal Ball Prices: The eighth phase of low-priced coal balls sold a total of 6,300 piculs of low-priced balls and will cease from the 20th. The ninth phase is pending a decision at the meeting. Currently, the source of coal dust is abundant, and the cost of production has been reduced. All retail prices on the market, whether factory or store sales, should be reduced accordingly. However, the relevant trade association is still waiting and watching, which is inexcusable.</p>
<p>Situation in Chengxi (Jiangyin and Wuxi): News from Wuxi reports that the puppet "Magistrate" of Jiangyin, He Peixuan, strongly "resigned." Li Tingzhang has been appointed to replace him. Li is from Xinning County, Hunan, and held important positions in Jiangxi Province before the war.

<h3>American Merchant Ship "Daxin" Has Entered Gu'aotou; Hana of Harner and Moford of Ford Intend to Test the Waters; Zhejiang Provincial Government Orders Ban on Navigation to Shipu</h3>
<p>After the Zhejiang and Fujian ports were blockaded by the Japanese navy, shipping routes were completely interrupted. Although Gu'aotou and Songmen were not included in the blockade, ships sailing to various ports were obstructed and forced to return, as reported in the newspapers. It is now known that the American merchant ship "Daxin" entered Gu'aotou the day before yesterday (21st). The ship's entry telegram has arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Activities of Shipping Merchants</p>
<p>Upon hearing this news, many shipping merchants are eager to try. The German merchant ship "Hana" of the Far East Company, previously obstructed and returned to Shanghai, has unloaded its cargo and intends to sail empty to explore the situation. Yesterday, it reported to the customs for customs clearance, which was approved. It is scheduled to set sail tomorrow morning. It is rumored that the "Moford" of Reiss &amp; Co. also has a proposal to sail. The German "Daping" of the Sino-Italian Company is still under repair and will attempt to sail once completed.</p>
<p>Small Ship Routes</p>
<p>As for the shipping route between Shanghai and various ports in eastern Zhejiang, the "Gaodeng" of the Lulun Shipping Company is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 24th, carrying passengers and cargo to Songmen, as well as Juexi, Nantian, and Jinqinggang. However, it was heard yesterday that there are still problems, and it has not been decided. The Italian "Anli" returned to Shanghai from Songmen the day before yesterday, but due to obstruction by Japanese warships and difficulties in cargo transportation, the voyage was delayed. Therefore, it has been decided to temporarily suspend operations. The "Lima," which sails to Cengang, is operating smoothly, with one sailing every three days. The shipping route to Dinghai, which has already fallen, is monopolized by three Japanese small ships, including the Lianfeng Maru.</p>
<p>Shipu Navigation Ban</p>
<p>Regarding Shipu, although it is not within the Japanese blockade zone, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has prohibited navigation. This ban has been telegraphed to the shipping industry in this city by the Ningbo Defense Command. The original telegram stated, "Instructed by the acting telegram of Provincial Chairman Huang Qinyong, it has been found that Shipu is a place where various red sailboats store goods. Recently, it has been repeatedly reported that prohibited items are privately transported and stored in the port. Merchants use the pretext of unclogging the interior to engage in smuggling, and able-bodied men are escaping, making it difficult to control. The difficulties in controlling materials after opening navigation have been listed in detail and telegraphed to Commander Gu for review. We have now received a telegram stating that fishing boats and cargo transportation should be handled at your discretion. It should be complied with. In addition to allowing fishing boats to continue fishing and restricting the handling of essential necessities, all wheeled steamships engaged in the business of carrying cargo should be suspended to facilitate administration and strengthen defense."</p>

<h3>Foreign Ships to Haiphong Suddenly Postponed; Seemingly Related to the Situation in Vietnam</h3>
<p>According to news from foreign shipping circles, it is rumored that French Vietnam intends to accept Japanese demands, and it is feared that the situation in Vietnam will fall into a state of war. Therefore, the Taikoo Company's "Shandong" ship, originally scheduled to depart for Haiphong at dawn yesterday, has temporarily suspended its departure due to the unstable situation there. However, the Taikoo Company issued a notice yesterday, only stating that the departure has been postponed to the 25th of this month, without explaining the reason for the postponement. It was also found that the ship's suspension of departure was not requisitioned by the British authorities in this city, so it seems to be related to the situation in Vietnam. Furthermore, the French Mail Line's "Xijiang" ship, originally scheduled to set sail directly for Haiphong from Shanghai at 8:00 AM today, has been postponed to tomorrow (the 25th) at 8:30 AM due to unfinished loading, and it is said that there will be no further delays.</p>

<h3>Reporter Cheng Zhenzhang of the Da Mei Evening News Laid to Rest Yesterday; Colleagues Saddened by the Loss; Mourning Guests Wept</h3>
<p>Cheng Zhenzhang, international editor of the Da Mei Evening News, was suddenly shot and killed by thugs at the intersection of West Aisi Road and Jin Shenfu Road on the morning of the 19th. Details have been reported in the newspapers. Colleagues at the Da Mei Evening News were saddened by the loss and organized a funeral committee to handle all funeral arrangements. The memorial service was held at the International Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. Many people from all walks of life attended to pay their respects. Wreaths of flowers sent as condolences filled the space in front of the altar. The hall was arranged with benches in a rectangular shape, surrounded by wreaths. The coffin was placed in the center, with the lid open. Mr. Cheng lay peacefully inside. After a mortician performed cosmetic procedures, he looked lifelike, with a vibrant spirit. He was wearing a white broadcloth suit, a bright red tie, and white leather shoes, looking extremely dapper. As the clock struck 2:00 PM, everyone bowed three times to the portrait amidst sobbing and mournful music, standing in silent tribute.</p>
<p>Life Story</p>
<p>Then, his close friend reported on Mr. Cheng's life story. According to him, Mr. Cheng's life can be divided into three periods. The first period, from 1930 to 1933, was his school period. After class, he gathered like-minded comrades with literary interests and founded the weekly magazines "Nahan" (Outcry) and "Lion's Roar," which were entirely composed of new, young writers. The second period, from 1933 to 1936, was his time serving at the Chen Bao newspaper. In addition to his editorial duties, he continued to learn diligently and often wrote commentaries. His colleagues admired the impartiality of his opinions. The third period was after the Chen Bao newspaper closed, when he joined the Xin Bao and, finally, the Da Mei Evening News. Unfortunately, he encountered an accident while being faithful to his duties, fulfilling a great and just mission, which makes us feel deeply saddened and inconsolable.</p>
<p>Viewing the Remains</p>
<p>After the general manager of the newspaper, Bai Luosi, led the guests to view the remains, the coffin was closed to bid farewell to Mr. Cheng forever. All those who mourned on the spot wept and lamented. Bai Luosi and his eight close friends helped carry the coffin out of the hall and into the funeral home. The most heartbreaking scene was his mother, who followed behind the coffin, weeping uncontrollably. The mother and son, who depended on each other for life, were tragically separated, creating immeasurable sadness.</p>
<h3>Murder Case on Route Doumer; Zhou Jinyin Shot Dead; Ambushed After Lunch at Jinjiang; Stray Bullet Injured Two Young Female Students</h3>
<p>Yesterday at noon, a sudden assassination occurred across from the Enxiangfang on Route Doumer in the French Concession. The victim was named Zhou Jinyin, from Hangzhou, who was shot twice and died from his injuries. Stray bullets also injured two female students walking by. The following are the detailed findings of the news agency reporter:</p>
<p>Lunch at Jinjiang</p>
<p>Zhou Jinyin, also known as Shimin, 33 years old, from Hangzhou, currently resides at No. 376, Third House, in a two-story building on Jufu Road, French Concession, paying a monthly rent of 60 yuan. Zhou's wife's younger sister, siblings, and others are all in Shanghai, so he divided the building into two rooms. Zhou and his wife, Fan Huiwen (23 years old), lived in the front room, while the back room was provided for his wife's younger brother and others to rest in. This arrangement has been in place for three months. Yesterday around 10:00 AM, Zhou made an appointment with friends Han and Xu for lunch at the Jinjiang Tea Room on Hualong Road. He went with his wife, Fan. Zhou wore a light gray silk long gown and white silk shirt and pants. After lunch at Jinjiang, it was already 12:05 PM. They left together. Han had other business to attend to, so he said goodbye after leaving and headed towards Xiafei Road. Zhou, his wife, and Xu walked and talked towards Route Doumer.</p>
<p>(Ambushed En Route)</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, at this time, next to the miscellaneous goods stall by the fence across from the Enxiangfang on Route Doumer, two men and women in short clothes bought two bags of spiced beans and started eating them. They glanced at Zhou and the others passing by, suddenly pulled out pistols, and fired two shots at Zhou. One bullet hit Zhou in the head, and the other hit him in the chest. He immediately bled profusely and fell on the sidewalk across from No. 48 Route Doumer, next to Enxiangfang, barely breathing. The shooters, seeing their goal achieved, still wanted to fire another shot, but the gun jammed, and the bullet failed to fire. Zhou disregarded the danger and shouted for help. Nearby police, who had heard the gunshots, came to encircle and capture them. The shooters preemptively fired at the police, who returned fire. Fifteen or sixteen shots were fired in total. As a result, the criminals threw their guns into the wasteland inside the French military barracks and fled to the intersection of Huanlong Road, climbing over a low wall into the Gujiazhai Garden. The Western and Chinese detectives from the police station then encircled the garden for a strict search, but the criminals had already escaped without a trace.</p>
<p>Died from Injuries</p>
<p>The injured Zhou was taken to Guangci Hospital, but he died before arriving due to the severity of his injuries. However, the body was still sent to the hospital and then transferred to the Tielasi Road mortuary for examination. During the crossfire, it was lunchtime for students to return home from school, resulting in two female students from Hualong Elementary School, Xu Baogen (14 years old) and Zheng Dingjian (12 years old), being hit by stray bullets in their legs. They were also sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Zhou's wife, Fan Huiwen, was questioned by the police, but Zhou's friend, Xu, disappeared when the shooting started. As for the motive for the assassination, the police, after investigating the case, believe it was a vendetta and are currently conducting a strict search for the perpetrators. As for Zhou's occupation, inquiries made by the reporter to Zhou's co-residents revealed that Zhou rented the house in Fan Huiwen's name and only knew that Zhou worked at the Yihua Industrial Society on Daxilu. Another investigation revealed that Zhou was the owner of a certain printing house. (Another report) Two Chinese children were injured by stray bullets, one in the buttocks and the other in the thigh and foot. The deceased had previously opened a printing house and was now engaged in brokerage business. It is rumored that the motive for the assassination may be due to a personal feud. The pistol abandoned by the perpetrators during their escape was inspected by the police and found not to be connected to other cases.</p>
<h3>Dancer Chen Juanjuan Accused of Assault; Both Parties Have Reached a Settlement</h3>
<p>Chen Juanjuan, a dancer at the Guotai Dance Hall on Yu Qiaqing Road, has a good reputation for her dancing skills. On the evening of the 9th of last month, Chen, Gu Erkang (a shareholder of the Guotai Dance Hall), and Gu Haitao (another shareholder of the Guotai Dance Hall) suddenly clashed for unknown reasons, leading to a physical fight that disrupted the order of the dance hall. Afterwards, Gu Haitao reported the incident to the Xinzha Police Station, accusing Chen Juanjuan of organizing a gang to commit violence, causing serious injuries and losing a diamond ring. After investigation by the police, an arrest warrant was issued for Chen, and Gu placed a reward advertisement in the newspaper for Chen Juanjuan's arrest, forcing Chen Juanjuan to temporarily avoid dancing. It is now learned that the case has been mediated by people and that both parties have reached an understanding, agreeing to a settlement, resolving the dispute.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Over Failure to Deliver Ordered Cement; Wufu Company Sues Dingkang Firm</h3>
<p>Chen Youqing of Wufu Company in this city ordered 1,000 bags of "Red Dragon" brand cement from Zhu Lianqing, owner of Dingkang Trading Company at No. 160, Sixth Floor, Aidoo Road, on April 24 of this year. The price was seven yuan per bag, totaling 7,000 yuan. An advance deposit of 2,000 yuan was paid, and delivery was agreed upon by May 15 of this year. However, the delivery was not made on time. At the same time, the price of cement soared to 15 yuan per bag. Wufu Company learned that the trading company had sold the ordered goods at a higher price, causing the delay in delivery. The company had already sold all the cement, and had to purchase existing stock at market price, incurring a loss of over 7,000 yuan. Having been unable to negotiate with the trading company, they hired lawyer Ma Yizhong to file a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the First Special District Court against Zhu Lianqing for failure to deliver the goods. The case was heard by Judge Tao yesterday. Both parties were represented by lawyers. After a detailed hearing, the court adjourned the hearing to another date to investigate the defendant's evidence.</p>
<h3>Shadow Puppet Exhibition to Support Nursery</h3>
<p>The Shanghai YWCA, with the intention of benefiting children and families, proposed the establishment of a free childcare center for underprivileged children. The association planned and sought a location for the operation, but due to the considerable funds required, the project was delayed. Fortunately, artist Zhou Jiyuan, recently returned from elsewhere, brought over 200 shadow puppet paintings he had created. To assist the association in raising funds for the opening expenses of the childcare center, he volunteered to hold a personal shadow puppet exhibition at the YWCA hall on Jingan Temple Road. Fifty percent of the proceeds from ticket sales, after deducting expenses, will be donated to the center, and fifty percent of the proceeds from the sale of artwork will also be contributed. Shadow puppets have significant uses in Western countries, such as in advertising, graphic design, and decoration, and are widely used. However, there is little attention paid to this in our country. Now, a unique art form is being offered for the appreciation of connoisseurs, with a single-color, finely printed shadow puppet picture included with each ticket, limited to 5,000 copies.</p>
<h3>Large Quantity of Military Weapons Found Hidden in Gluten Workshop; Searched by Japanese Military Police; Shop Owner Zhang Chunquan on the Run</h3>
<p>Around 11:00 AM the day before yesterday (the 22nd), the Japanese military police dispatched more than 20 military police officers, accompanied by more than ten police officers from the Xujiahui "Police Station," in trucks to Xuzhen Road in Xujiahui Town, temporarily cutting off traffic for a major search. Afterwards, a news agency reporter learned that the Japanese military police were searching the Zhang Tongtai gluten workshop on that road. A large quantity of military weapons was found inside the workshop, including a large number of rifles, approximately 10,000 rounds of ammunition, and five medium-sized bombs. The shop owner, Zhang Chunquan, had already fled beforehand. The Japanese side considers the matter serious and is still conducting a strict investigation.</p>
<h3>Four Robbers Apprehended; Stolen Goods Displayed for Claim</h3>
<p>The Chengdu Road Police Station recently apprehended four male and female robbers, who were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The case is currently under postponement. The gang confessed to having invaded Room 10 of Apartment No. 5, Lane 470, Seymour Road, on July 12 of this year, armed and in a group, robbing Cantonese women Chen Yanming and Xu Miaojin of 150 yuan and a rectangular gold watch with a gold chain. The detectives have retrieved the stolen goods, which are temporarily stored at the police station. However, the two victims have moved to another location, and their address is unknown, making it impossible for the police station to investigate. It is rumored that Chen and Xu are dancers at a certain dance hall. After seeing the news, it is hoped that they will immediately go to the detective section of the Chengdu Road Police Station to claim the stolen goods.</p>
<h3>Attempted Kidnapping of Zhong Caiqing Thwarted; Rickshaw Driver Suspected and Arrested</h3>
<p>At 9:10 AM on the 19th of this month, several kidnappers hired a car from the Xiang Sheng Seventh Branch on Jiaozhou Road. The rickshaw driver, Qian Aliang, No. 77, was driven away. The car then drove to Lipu Road, attempting to kidnap Zhong Caiqing, manager of the De'erke Light Bulb Factory, but failed. After the arrest of a thug posing as a rickshaw driver, Pan Jiangsheng, he was sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The police station found that Qian Aliang, the rickshaw driver of Xiang Sheng, was also suspected of collusion. He had received a reward of 25 yuan from the gang. He was apprehended and sent to the First Special District Court yesterday morning, requesting detention and joint interrogation. The court granted the request.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Speculation Interest Decreases</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold unofficial market was lethargic and unable to recover. In addition, foreign exchange continued to ease and flatten, and operators' interest decreased. Although some buyers were constantly purchasing, most leaned towards selling. The morning opening was at $5,690. After money changers and banks sold, it immediately fell to a low of $5,658. Later, gold firms and securities houses took the opportunity to carry in, and it returned to $5,692. The noon closing was at $5,677. The afternoon market initially was extremely flat, opening at $5,675, then falling another $5. Later, due to sudden purchases from the Hong Kong gang and panic buying from retail investors, the price rose to $5,695. Although short sellers from the gold firms came out one after another, the buying interest was still good at this time, and the evening closing was also at $5,680, down slightly by $15 from the previous day. The total daily transaction volume was still strong, with over 2,500 taels. Gold jewelry prices ultimately remained unchanged, and customs duties remained flat.</p>
<p>Gold Fell $15 Since Morning Every Bar (Ten Taels), initially with slightly weary sentiment, the market opened with a decrease of $5, with gold firms selling securities houses ten taels, for $5,690. Then, due to competition between gold firms and money changers to sell, the trend was soft, falling another $32. Gold firms sold gold firms ten taels, lower at $5,658. Then, relying on securities houses and gold firms to buy in, and retail investors also seizing the opportunity to drag in cheaply, the market trend changed from weary to stable, rising to $5,692. Later, the money changers returned to sell, and buyers hesitated, and before the closing, it dropped to $5,667 again. However, the closing relied on the gold firms to pull up, and there was still $5,677. The initial afternoon market was flat and weary, opening with a decrease of $2, with gold firms mutually trading, for $5,675. Then, due to money changers selling, it fell another $5, with money changers selling gold firms ten taels, retreating to $5,670. Later, fortunately, retail investors bought in, and the Hong Kong gang also suddenly dragged in, and before long, it soared to $5,695. Afterwards, the price fell again by more than $10, as gold firms' long positions came out. Money changers sold gold firms twenty taels, for $5,680 as the evening closing price. As a result, it was down slightly by $15 from the previous day, with only a fluctuation of $37 throughout the day. The cash price of gold firms and the selling price of proprietary gold are higher by about a dozen dollars than gold, and the purchase price is reduced by $30. The current mark price is more than $50 lower than the listed price of proprietary gold, and there is little trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Prices Remain Unchanged</p>
<p>The price of gold jewelry per tael in jewelry stores remains unchanged. Dahang remains at the original price of $580, and the prices in the new shops are similar to the prices above, with purchases reduced by about $30.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Returns Slightly $2</h3>

<h3>Another Blow to Those Who Like to Collect Foreign Currency The British Pound Note Plunged Yesterday</h3>
<p>In order to prevent British currency from falling into the hands of the Germans and to exchange British exchange, yesterday each newspaper published the British Embassy's announcement of a plan to prohibit the import of Bank of England notes into the United Kingdom. Because of the complicated procedures for sending banknotes to the UK in this city and the need to bear the risk of postal delivery en route, the market has changed. The initial opening price was $53. Because more sellers emerged and buyers hesitated, most stopped buying and selling. There was a market without goods. However, some banks still had trading. After the afternoon closing, some banks' buying prices were calling $48, although not the official market, falling $6-7 compared to the 22nd. The exchange rate for British exchange yesterday was $3 pence 7/32 (70.3125), and each pound was worth $64.81 in legal tender, while the price of each British gold note was $48. The difference between the two was $16.81 per pound, that is, the British gold note was only worth 74% of the British exchange. Since this incident occurred, it has caused another blow to those in Shanghai who like to collect foreign currency. With the situation so unstable, the future fate of various foreign currencies is also unknown. So those who hold foreign currency are worried again. (British)</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw slightly small rotations in gold, and British and American gold pounds were also fatigued. The British gold note continued to plunge by $3.40 under certain rumors, calculated at $51.60, and each party had a rare need, while the supply was quite abundant, resulting in more emptiness. The American gold note revolved within a small range, and finally fell by one cent, to $17.73. Hong Kong notes were fairly balanced in supply and demand, and the market price was stable. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes are still rising, with the former at $1.455 and the latter at $1.085.</p>
<h3>Securities Domestic Debt Floating and Grasping Uncertainty After a Sharp Rise, a Small Correction is Seen Foreign Stocks Rise Universally</h3>
<p>The stock market yesterday saw a large number of long positions released by big players, and the market price shifted from stable to falling. The reason is the uncertainty of the floating long positions. As soon as the market situation softened slightly, they immediately let go to seek evening. There was absolutely no change in the environment. Market rumors are intentionally spread by a very small number of long and short positions without awareness in order to profit themselves, which is not worth knowing. A smile from a knowledgeable person is enough. A sharp rise with a small correction is an intended matter. The market was very stable at the initial opening yesterday, and not smaller than the day before yesterday's price. Jiufeng's short covering was very lively, but since Xinfu's long positions emerged very strongly, the price could not support it. Hongda, Yongkang, Wuyuan, and each house followed the wind. Although Hengkang, Lianyi, and Hongkang absorbed, they failed to stand firm. The morning saw a decrease of 23-30 cents. In the afternoon, Jiufeng continued to enter, Hongda also turned from selling to buying, and Lianhe also had absorption. Sixth Place had a very strong appetite, Hengkang continued to enter, Xinfu's long positions continued to emerge, Yitai and Tongkang added codes, Yongfeng and Defu drifted with the tide. Retail long positions also sold out one after another, and the market price saw exhaustion. As a result, it fell by 35-75 cents. Throughout the day, Hengkang's purchase of nearly 300,000 was most notable, because it had sold at a high price the day before yesterday, and now it has returned. The total transaction volume was more than one million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading The transaction of 20 shares of Dasheng No. 1 Factory stock, the price is 14 yuan.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Stock Exchange continued to be firm and bullish, and the prices of each stock continued to increase and rise, with very little turning back. Regarding the weekend settlement as nothing, so almost no stock did not rise. Rubber stocks are the most popular, and the amount of transactions is huge, which has not been seen for a long time in the simple morning trading process. It is very difficult to list the rising stocks individually, because the firmness of the market situation is too universal. Whether this kind of vigorous trend can be continued remains to be proven by the facts next week.</p>
<p>London, 23rd (Thursday) The listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British merchant companies' stocks today are still flat and sluggish. Only HSBC Hong Kong Registered Stock rose by half a pound, with the price at 68.5 pounds. English registration was unchanged, and there were no other changes.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Distant Covering Yarn Market Recovers</h3>
<p>After the yarn market began to stabilize, the trend slightly increased. This is because it has been rotating for a long time without falling, causing some speculators' minds to move, and they came to absorb a few packages. At the same time, for the futures to be withdrawn in September, because of profitability, they also came to compensate, so the people's hearts were shaken, and the market has recovered. However, the actual sales channel is still narrow, and the inventory is still thick, and has not been reduced. The fundamental problem must rely on consumption as the first priority. The September futures price initially made $924, then $934.</p>
<p>The spot market opened flat in the morning, with a gentle situation. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse was $926, not much different from the previous day. Once this market opened, there was very little change, and everyone looked at each other and did not move. Therefore, it rotated for a long time. By the time of closing, it was slightly rising, because short positions were entered into September, and people's hearts were lifted. The closing price of 20-count Double Horse was $926.5, and after that it was made to $932. The half-day transaction statistics totaled 1,790 packages. The market for 10-count Double Horse rose by $3.5. Today, 380 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Yantai, and 60 pieces were shipped to Tianjin. Yesterday, there were also 947 pieces shipped to Yantai and 537 pieces shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each gang is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Peer 1,520 Hong Kong 185 Wenzhou 50</p>
<p>Inland 125 Statistics 1,790</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Trading Scattered</h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation has shown a slight improvement, but factories are still not absorbing it in bulk. Only sporadic replenishment transactions of raw cotton occur occasionally and on a small scale, so prices are slightly firm. As for the business of fellow traders settling previous transactions, it is relatively large. The price of Fire Machine Brand cotton and grassy bales is 154 yuan, white bales are at 160 yuan, and good quality Tongzhou cotton is priced at 180 yuan. Generally speaking, the cotton market is also on the horizontal line. The biggest factor is that new cotton will soon be on the market. The weather has been dry recently, and the harvest season is earlier than in previous years. Therefore, all parties are temporarily taking a wait-and-see approach.</p>
<p>In other news, the price of foreign cotton: the New York cotton market is once again quiet, as there is a lack of buyers in the market, and at the same time, some large positions are being closed out. As a result, the closing price fell by four or five points compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market fell by more than one rupee yesterday, including forecasts.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been slightly relaxed in recent days. Japanese manufacturers have slightly increased their purchases, but the quantity is not large. As fellow traders are well aware of the scarcity of spot goods on the market and the infrequency of ship arrivals, they are quite keen to purchase. Although few transactions have been made, the sentiment is exceptionally firm.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Can AoJiang Be Navigated? The Key to Sales of Chinese-Made Cloth</h3>
<p>Domestically produced cloth: The market situation was calm yesterday, with sales channels being too narrow and speculators being inactive. However, holders of goods are maintaining a calm attitude. The decision of the Hana Maru to resume sailing to AoJiang has a significant impact on the future of the cloth market. There was little change in cloth prices yesterday. Small amounts of hand goods fell by 1 to 2.5 jiao per piece. The local street handled more than 20,000 pieces of satin, tricotine, velvet, and various grey fabrics, more than 200 pieces of coarse cloth, colored cloth, and printed goods, more than 200 pieces of colored cloth, twill, and other goods handled by Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants, and more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth and printed cloth handled by the Yantai merchants in the north.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The morning was flat, but the afternoon saw a rise, with a firm trend. White goods, especially long-staple fine cloth, hovered around 30 yuan 8 or 9 jiao in the morning, and the highest closing price in the afternoon was 31 yuan 1 jiao 5 fen. The "Four Gentlemen" serge rose to 9 jiao 1 fen 2.5 li. Although not many transactions were made, the market atmosphere was very tight.</p>
<p>Exports: Cotton cloth, yesterday (the 23rd), totaled 457 pieces, shipped to Yantai, and another 517 pieces shipped to Hong Kong. Today, there are 40 pieces to Tianjin and another 820 pieces to Yantai.</p>
<h3>Grain: More Foreign Rice Arrives, Sales Are Flat</h3>
<p>Sales of foreign rice were weak again yesterday. The local street has special sales arrangements, and long-term customers are satisfied. Mainland merchants have not been able to solve the transportation problems, so they have not continued to buy. Therefore, the market immediately fell by half a yuan after opening. Although there were scattered purchases by rural households and mainlanders in the later market, the final result was still weak. Grade 1 old Saigon was 59 yuan, 58 yuan 7 jiao, new superior was 57 yuan 2 jiao, 57 yuan, Grade 2 No. 1 was 53 yuan 8 jiao, Grade 1 Siam was 58 yuan 5 jiao, Grade 2 was 53 yuan, 52 yuan 6 jiao, fire-milled was 58 yuan, 57 yuan, Hong Kong superior was 57 yuan 3 jiao, 55 yuan, Jue was 52 yuan 5 jiao, small-milled was 53 yuan 2 jiao, 53, Tokyo polished superior was 48 yuan 5 jiao, 48 yuan, rough superior was 47 yuan 5 jiao, 47 yuan, broken superior was 43, 4 yuan, rice tea was 45 yuan 7 jiao, 45 yuan. Returned original packages were in oversupply. Grade 2 Siam fell slightly from 63 yuan to 62 yuan 5 jiao, down one yuan from the previous day. Grade 2 Saigon also fell from 63 yuan to 62 yuan 5 jiao, down half a yuan. However, rice tea had local sales, and the price opened at 55 yuan 5 jiao, which was half a yuan better. A total of 220 tons were sold, while only 40 bags of existing rice were sold.</p>
<p>A large batch of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday, totaling 16,301 bags, shipped directly from Saigon by the Randi, managed by Shun Heng Foreign Firm. It arrived at the port yesterday afternoon and is currently docked at the Bund Observatory Wharf in the French Concession for unloading.</p>
<p>Only six or seven hundred bags of japonica and glutinous domestic rice arrived, and trading in the open and closed markets was reportedly flat. Therefore, supply and demand were similar, and the selling price remained unchanged, with no significant gains or losses.</p>
<p>The number of new Zhoupu japonica rice arriving at the port was still small, only 24 dan. The morning market was weak due to the weakness of other goods, but it soon recovered, so the initial price was 62 yuan, 61 yuan 3 jiao, but the final price for special quality was still 63 yuan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Flour First Flat, Then Firm; Wheat Market Mixed</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour transactions were still dominated by Japanese factory flour, because although Chinese factory flour, Fuxin and old brand, were supplied, the quantity was very small. General speculators mostly focused on trading Phoenix brand futures. The market opened flat, but as shorts covered their positions and there were slight sales of existing flour, the price rose by several fen to 1.5 jiao. The price for this month was 14 yuan 3 jiao to 3 jiao 5 fen, and the prices for September and October were 14 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen and 14 yuan 7 jiao, respectively. A total of more than 7,000 bags were traded. The price for Chinese factory flour was still 15 yuan, and 3,000 bags were traded. There were few transactions of other flours, and the market was flat. In addition, 1,500 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin yesterday.</p>
<p>The new wheat market was relatively stable yesterday, with most owners unwilling to sell easily. However, there were also some small-scale vendors secretly selling at a lower price, so the market was slightly mixed. It was reported that three or four thousand bags of goods were delivered to the factory, but the selling price was not finalized. The purchasing price of Chinese factories was still around 13 yuan, and five or six hundred bags of Gao Du wheat were purchased.</p>
<p>300 bags of corn were shipped to Weihaiwei today.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: 8,000 Bags of Refined White Sugar Opened</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market did not fluctuate much. The association's price quotations: spot goods, second grade coarse white sugar, local warehouse, 73 yuan 5 jiao; new goods in foreign warehouses, 73 yuan 5 jiao; old goods, 72 yuan 8 jiao to 9 jiao; re-exported goods, i.e., warehouse warrants, 58 yuan 4 jiao; delivery on September 6, 59 yuan. Dutch-milled white sugar was slightly loose, TML mark 73 yuan 2 jiao, small triangle, KD mark 71 yuan 5 jiao, small 7 jiao. After continuous increases, Dutch red sugar slightly decreased, yesterday it was 62 yuan 5 jiao. Taikoo Refined White B mark 74 yuan 5 jiao to 74 yuan, small 7 jiao, lower grade sugar decreased more, DY mark 69 yuan, down 2 yuan, HX mark 68 yuan 6 jiao, the same decrease. The same price for delivery at the end of this month, H mark car red sugar 60 yuan 2 jiao, small 8 jiao. Taikoo Foreign Firm opened a total of 8,000 bags of refined white sugar for immediate shipment, DY mark at HK$12.80, HX mark at HK$12.70, the combined price was more favorable, so the price quotation also followed the trend. The factory's snow white sugar was 71 yuan, down 1 yuan, and there was no change in the factory's crystal sugar.</p>
<h3>Dried Fruits and Nuts: New Longans Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>The arrival of new Hainan longans has increased, and the market continues to soften. However, this year's output is higher than last year's, so it is impossible to hold on and not sell. Therefore, the northern and southern market firms have opened up as scheduled yesterday, with the higher price being 130 yuan, and the decided price being slightly reduced. It is reported that the market price in Hong Kong is better than in Shanghai, so the source of supply may decrease in the future, and the market may benefit from this turnaround.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Guanli Shrimp Tails from Yantai Presented Fresh</h3>
<p>The first batch of new Guanli shrimp tails from Yantai, six boxes, arrived, with excellent color, but unfortunately the shrimp were very small, so it was difficult to sell at a high price. Yesterday, they opened at 287 yuan. It is reported that more will arrive in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous: Cigarette Factory Production Is Insufficient</h3>
<p>The price of cigarettes in the unofficial market has been rising steadily in recent days, because the factory's shipments are not smooth and sales in various places are quite strong, resulting in tight market conditions. Yesterday, the market price of the Great Britain brand was 1,082 yuan, the Old Knife brand was 794 yuan, the Little Fairy was 525 yuan, and the Five Flowers brand was 514 yuan. The price of the Little Champagne brand produced by the Great Eastern Company rose by 25 yuan due to foreign exchange factors, and the new price was 471 yuan.</p>

<h3>Humorous Anecdotes upon Receiving News</h3>
<p>In Suzhou, during the years of the provincial examinations, all ships receiving news from various prefectures are moored near Tong Bridge in Shantang. The students often linger by the bridge on the day of the announcement, hoping for good news. A certain student told a story of receiving news, which is both amusing and cautionary! It is said that in a certain department of a certain province in a certain subject, hundreds of people went to the examination. After the announcement, they all went outside the city to look at the news boats. From afar, they heard the sound of gongs resounding. Soon they saw the yellow flag of receiving news being hoisted high. With two oars and double paddles, the boat was as fast as an arrow. As it approached the city, the students stood on both banks, craning their necks and waving their hands, anxiously asking for news. They saw an old doorman standing precariously at the bow of the boat, shaking his spirit, ringing the gong endlessly. Looking around, seeing the students eagerly inquiring, he stopped ringing the gong, raised his voice, and said to the crowd: "Gentlemen, you usually use taverns as study rooms, opium dens as schools, brothels as examination halls, and gambling dens as examination sites. You do not read poetry or study literature. This year's list has people from every prefecture and every county, except for this place of mine, where there is not a single one. All have fallen into the vast ocean! I was hoping to bring good news and earn some silver, but now I have wasted my effort and lost my time. Where can I be compensated? I ask you, gentlemen, do you have face or no face!" After saying this, he threw the gong with one hand and the hammer with the other, sighed deeply, and went into the cabin. The students knew that they had failed, and had no time to argue with him. They all lowered their heads and went home dejectedly. It is said that in the next examination, the number of those who passed from that department was twice as many as in other places.</p>

<h3>Free Talk, Thirtieth Year</h3>
<p>— The Editor</p>
<p>Starting today, Free Talk enters its thirtieth year.</p>
<p>Among the supplements of various Chinese newspapers, Free Talk can be considered one of the most historically long-lived. When we bring out and look at old newspapers from around the birth of the Republic of China, we seem to be reading the history of the Republic of China. We see the giant wheels of the era turning, we see the revolutionary currents of thought gestating, we see the new China growing longer. And Free Talk was founded at this time. (August 24, 1911)</p>
<p>Many young readers may not have the opportunity to see the face of Free Talk in its early years. We specially, at the beginning of the thirtieth year, select a portion from each stage and republish it as a small commemoration.</p>
<p>These short articles have all left traces and had an effect in the minds of the previous generation.</p>
<p>July 1st of the Xinhai Year (August 24, 1911)</p>
<h3>### Generous and Tragic Song: Yue Wumu's Poetry and Lyrics</h3>
<p>Song Yue Wumu's "Manjianghong" lyrics. Generous and impassioned. Many people recite it. But they do not know that many of his poems and lyrics are also worth passing down. Such as "Sending Mr. Ziyan Zhang on the Northern Expedition" says: "Commands are swift as wind and thunder. The voice of heaven shakes the northern frontier. Charge straight into Henan and Luoyang. Strike directly towards Yan and You. Horses trample the blood of the princesses. Banners behead the heads of the Khans. Return to report to the wise ruler. Restore the old Divine Land." Eulogy for Mr. Shizhai says: "It has been thirty years since the southward crossing. How many of the robes and hats remain today? Heartbroken at the loss of the old guards. Turning my head to look at the Central Plains. Leaving the country due to the power of treacherous officials. Preserving my body thanks to the grace of the sage ruler. Bringing about the days of Yao and Shun for the ruler. Sincere intentions entrusted to humble words." Sending to the Buddhist monk Huikai says: "How many autumns at Wenpu and Mount Lu? The Yangtze River twists and turns towards the east. A man should aspire to support the royal family. The sage ruler personally leads the campaign to eliminate the barbarian chiefs. The achievements must be engraved on the Yanshan stone. Retirement will ultimately accompany Chisong. Please convey my words to the old man of Donglin. The Lotus Society should from now on focus on cultivation." Inscription on Juma Ridge says: "Standing on the Lin Ridge, my eyes open to the battlefield. Where the battle clouds open, a stream flows. The water of Ji Spring is still said to be Jin's. In whose palace is the Shu millet flourishing, who mourns for Zhou? The southern lands are only small clowns. When will the northern chariots return to the Divine Land? I vow to repay the wise ruler with my seven-foot body. Angrily pointing to the horizon, my tears cannot be contained." Inscription on the wall of Guichi Zhai Mountain says: "In recent years, dust has filled my battle clothes. Leisurely humming, I climb the emerald green. Good waters and good mountains cannot be seen enough. Horse hooves urge me to return in the bright moonlight." The "Little Heavy Mountain" lyrics say: "Last night, the cold crickets kept chirping. Startling me from a thousand-mile dream. It's already the third watch. I get up and walk around the steps alone. People are quiet, and the moonlight outside the curtain is hazy. My white head is for fame. The old pines and bamboos of my old mountain are old. Blocking my journey home. I want to entrust my thoughts to the Yaoqin. Few understand my music. Who will listen when the strings are broken?"</p>

<h3>Jokes: Secrets of Humor</h3>
<p>August 24, Year 9 of the Republic</p>
<p>— Changshou Ren</p>
<p>Recently, Free Talk has published many secrets. The reporter also has several secrets. Dare not keep it secret. Publish it to the world.</p>
<p>Secrets to curing diseases. In recent times, incompetent doctors treat people's diseases. Often there is a problem of medicine not matching the symptoms. I now think of the safest way. It is better for the doctor to prescribe a prescription in advance. Making people get sick according to the prescription. Perhaps the medicine will cure the disease. Absolutely no mistakes.</p>

<h3>Free Talk: Three Words and Two Phrases</h3>
<p>August 23, Year 14 of the Republic</p>
<p>I was just saying that there's nothing to see in the student movement. It's better to be calm. Wait until August 18th to watch the Qiantang tide in Shanghai. But I didn't expect the student movement at Beijing Women's Normal University to escalate even higher. Many female students were injured. Heads were broken and bleeding. Had to go to the hospital. It's lucky that no one was killed this time. Otherwise, the student dormitory would be a sea of blood. What would that be? It seems that in the future, fathers and elder brothers who send their children to school. Must hire bodyguards for them. At least, they must buy insurance from an insurance company to avoid paying a whole sum of tuition fees. If they are beaten to death, they will have to pay for funeral expenses.</p>
<h3>Recording the Collection of the Heroine Qiu Jin</h3>
<p>August 23, Year 17 of the Republic</p>
<p>— Jiyang</p>
<p>Thoughts in the Yellow Sea Boat: Hearing this, the place where the fierce battle took place that year. Still bearing traces of blood. Rushing and driving the horses, the dream of the Central Plains. Broken rivers and mountains, shame of the old country. Grieving for the lack of authority over the territorial waters. Sharpening the knife, eager to think of revenge. The heavenly wind blows coldly on my face. A hundred thousand clouds and smoke in my eyes.</p>
<p>Feelings of Anger: A vast and desolate Divine Land, sighing and sinking. Ashamed of being born as a teacher, with no plans to teach. Vowing to seize sand to revive the Chu. Striking Qin with no hammer. Knowing that the people are cheap when the country is broken. The righteousness is high, not hindering the poverty of the traveler's bag. Hating that the business has not repaid the comrades. Holding the sword, singing sadly, tears flowing horizontally.</p>
<h3>Various Donation Ranks</h3>
<p>August 26, Year 22 of the Republic</p>
<p>— Luowen</p>
<p>In the mid-Qing Dynasty, one could become an official by donating money. Those were called the "donation ranks." The young masters of wealthy families, with oily hair and shiny faces, would suddenly be busy for a few days. They would have a small crystal bead on their heads, sometimes with an old feather, speaking official language, saying, "The weather is good today."</p>
<p>By the Republic of China, it was supposed that donating for official positions was gone. But in reality, the path of donating for ranks was opened up even more. Even "scholars and literati" could obtain official hats through this method. The first chapter of the founding principle was naturally to have money. As long as you have money, everything is easy. For example, if you want to donate to become a scholar, you can buy a batch of antiques, get to know a few French guests, and hire a few workers to rub out the patterns and words on the antiques, print them into a book using glass plates, and call it "Collected Antiquities" or "Archaeological Records." Li Fusun made a "Record of Epigraphy," which was exclusively for people who studied epigraphy. But this became a "precedent," allowing French guests to continue and expand on it, even including young masters and merchants who collect and sell antiques. This was called "epigraphers."</p>
<p>Donating to become a "writer" also doesn't require new tricks. Just open a bookstore, pull in a few writers, hire some idle helpers, and publish a small newspaper. You must also be able to say "The weather is good today," write it down, print it, and give it to the newspaper vendors. In less than a year or two, success is guaranteed. But the rubbings of patterns and words from antiques cannot be used. They should be replaced with photos of movie stars and modern women, because this is the art of the new era. There are still many people in China who "love beauty," and "writers" or "artists" arise in this way.</p>
<p>Donating for an official position can hope to make a profit by plundering the people. But donating for scholars and literati won't result in a loss either. Printed materials can certainly be sold for cash, and foreigners will be willing to pay high prices for antiques in the future.</p>
<p>This is also called "gaining both fame and wealth." But first, you need to be able to "invest." So ordinary people can't do it. Otherwise, scholars and literati wouldn't be worth much.</p>
<p>But they are still worth money now, so people are still busy making biographical dictionaries, writing literary histories, publishing essays on writers, and compiling autobiographies. I think that if you are writing a historical work, you should divide writers into Romantic, Classical, and a separate "Donation Rank" school. History should be "true," and it's okay to offend some people, isn't it?</p>
<h3>Imperturbability</h3>
<p>August 3, Year 28 of the Republic</p>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Hearing bad news, we naturally furrow our brows and grit our teeth; similarly, hearing good news, we can't help but nod and give a knowing smile. Humans are emotional animals, and it is only natural to have these expressions when our emotions are affected by hateful or joyful things.</p>
<p>However, I believe that our usual expressions of emotion are casual, and in this extraordinary era, they are not appropriate and not enough.</p>
<p>From the beginning, we have known the arduousness of our responsibility, and we have long been determined to achieve our goals, regardless of how the environment changes, with unyielding persistence. Therefore, any external news, whether bad or good, we really have no reason to be emotional other than to pay close attention and use it as a reference. Moreover, expressions of hatred often lead to frustration, while expressions of joy often lead to laziness. It is inevitable that frustration leads to a decline in ambition, and laziness leads to a dissipation of spirit. We absolutely do not need that!</p>
<p>Imperturbability is what our wise predecessors called不动心 (bù dòng xīn), "not moving the heart." This is a skill that all great figures throughout history have had to cultivate. We people of today are certainly not all great figures, but we are the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, the favored children of heaven. We dare not belittle ourselves. We are citizens of a great country, and at this critical moment of survival, everyone should maintain imperturbability.</p>
<p>We are by no means cold and heartless. In fact, our emotions are completely entrusted to our country and nation, and have already exceeded the scope of ordinary emotions. If we still cannot help but furrow our brows in hatred and smile in joy, we must redouble our efforts beyond these smiles and frowns to fully express our emotions.</p>
<p>Until this full expression of our emotions is achieved, we can only maintain imperturbability. And we should know that, apart from our barbarians, the actions of other friends, although sometimes unfavorable to us, seem not to help us, are mostly for their own benefit, not because they harbor resentment against us; similarly, apart from ourselves, although they sometimes benefit us, seem to help us, it is often for their own benefit, not necessarily because they love us. So, why should we hate and rejoice because of them?</p>
<p>泰山崩于前而色不变; 麋鹿兴于左而目不瞬 (Tàishān bēng yú qián ér sè bù biàn; mílù xīng yú zuǒ ér mù bù shùn) - "The Taishan Mountain collapses in front of you, but your expression does not change; a deer appears on the left, but you do not blink an eye." We must have this kind of imperturbability, and only look at the goal and run straight ahead! Otherwise, in the future, bad news or good news will continue to come, and we will only have emotional impulses, what else can we do?</p>
<h3>Imperturbability</h3>
<p>August 17, Year 23 of the Republic</p>
<p>It's not surprising that, in summer, gentlemen who care about the world and the people suddenly intensify their emphasis on the "defense" between men and women? Women's clothing in summer is really too provocative, and the focus of "provocation" is that too much of the physical body is exposed. Therefore, the official document banning women from showing their legs and feet is a proud work that hits the topic accurately.</p>
<p>When our ancestors lived a "barbaric" life in the mountains and forests, they had no clothes to cover their bodies. Everyone was used to seeing each other naked and didn't feel anything. However, this is precisely why barbarians are considered superficial. "Civilized people" have much more complex minds and emphasize "subtlety" and "having no end in sight." From this, "association" is particularly developed. Seeing a small, exposed leg makes them feel a little something. In fact, a leg is just a leg, far less expressive than eyebrows that can speak and eyes that can "send flirtation." Speaking of this, one can't help but admire the way Turkish women used to wear veils when going out, as that was truly thorough.</p>
<p>As for exposing legs and applying oil and powder, or painting red toenails when barefoot, changing from seeking convenience and coolness to wanting to be troublesome and look good—that is even more shocking. Of course, these legs with oil and powder are probably only a small part of the bare legs. Their purpose is completely different from ordinary bare legs. Not only should they not be allowed to "shine," but they might as well be thrown into a coal kiln. What a pity is that these legs mostly sit in cars, and law-abiding police officers can only look at them.</p>
<p>Looking at it from the other side, the leg owners go to the trouble of applying oil and powder simply to look good. Making the legs look good is not for their own appreciation, but because the male society that seizes power and prohibits bare legs needs this kind of decoration. It is said that there used to be female-centered societies. At that time, did men deliberately dress up like women do now? We are not very clear, but Wu Jingzi gave us an answer in "Flowers in the Mirror." Even men with big black beards in the Daughter Kingdom still have to apply rouge and powder. However, when gentlemen who care about the world and the people read "Flowers in the Mirror" to this part, they are unwilling to close the book and think about it.</p>
<h3>Simplification</h3>
<p>October 10, Year 27 of the Republic</p>
<p>— Baiwu</p>
<p>Being able to simplify is naturally very good. Because being simple allows one to settle. "Only when settled can one be calm, only when calm can one be at peace, only when at peace can one deliberate, and only when one deliberates can one gain!" Thus, those who advocate "simplification" have "gained" something.</p>
<p>However, "gain" is sometimes not enough to compensate for "loss," which is also very clear. For example, someone said this:</p>
<p>"In any case, if countries can still use non-interference to advise China and Japan to mediate, this may simplify things."</p>
<p>Why should countries "not interfere"? Yet why should they "advise"? For humanity? For justice? For human culture? However, in the face of humanity, justice, and human culture, there should be clear right and wrong, and passionate likes and dislikes. Not "non-interference," not "advising," but "aiding" the aggressed, as decided by the League of Nations!</p>
<p>This way, things are not simplified, because the fighting will continue.</p>
<p>Originally, it wasn't simple: the war of aggression and the war of anti-aggression, this relationship is international. The American Revolutionary War was not only American, but international, because it was a victory for justice and humanity, and humanity can be called humanity from then on. Only by incorporating all the laws of historical evolution into the personal or minority group's gains, can things naturally be simplified? This is to let China be a colony forever, and to let the aggressors be "imperialists" forever. Humans as knives and cutting boards, I am the fish, how simple!</p>
<p>However, everyone knows Sima Zhao's intentions! The majority of the Chinese people will not be deceived forever!</p>

<h3>The Whereabouts of the Dance Queen</h3>
<p>Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Five: Bad News</p>
<p>Shi Gui interjected, "What to get? I'll get it for you."</p>
<p>I shook my head and went straight upstairs. What I took was mainly a small black steel pistol, as well as rulers, pieces of paper, and other useful items. Because the person we were looking for at the moment was carrying a pistol, I naturally had to be prepared. A minute later, I followed Ni Jinshou into his car. Ni Jinshou had a separate chauffeur, and I sat side by side with him in the car, feeling very comfortable. After the car started, I asked him if he had any other information on the investigation. He briefly replied a few sentences.</p>
<p>He said, "I went to the Yangtze Hotel and asked about the banker Lu Jiansheng's whereabouts last night. He's a regular customer there, and the staff all know him, but he wasn't there last night."</p>
<p>I said, "Jinmei said that Lu Jiansheng called Wang Lilanzhi's house today to ask about it. He claimed that he was playing cards at the Yangtze Hotel all night and only found out about the tragic news when he got home at dawn."</p>
<p>"Yes, Mr. Huo, because of this, specially asked me to inquire about it when we parted. But he really wasn't there last night."</p>
<p>"So, why did he lie? This person is also a bit suspicious."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou hesitated for a moment and slowly replied, "However, this point alone doesn't count for anything. There are many people who are more suspicious than him right now. We shouldn't just put him on the list of suspects."</p>
<p>I was silent for a moment, feeling that Ni Jinshou was indeed somewhat apprehensive about this banker, and I naturally didn't want to continue this topic. (85)</p>

<h3>Casual Talk about the Beautiful Names of Movie Stars</h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>Currently, among the names of several female stars in our country, the most exquisite in terms of meaning is Chen Yanyan, and the most generous is Gu Lanjun. This is because the names of both of them transcend the ordinary range of naming with red fragrance and green jade, and form their own unique fragrance. According to the dictionary, "Yanyan" is a reduplicated word for "swallow" (Book of Songs). "Swallows flying," ancient people often used orioles and swallows to represent beauty, which is that meaning. Moreover, there is "Yingying" in ancient times, and "Yanyan" now, the two words echo each other interestingly. The word "Lanjun" means "orchid," which is the name of a fragrant herb. Ancient people used it as an adornment because of its clear and distant fragrance. "Jun" is an honorific title, a wife calls her husband (Ancient Yuefu, "Seventeen is the wife of Jun.") A husband calls his wife (Han Shu, "Returning relics to Xijun.") Both are called "Jun," and there are also titles called "Jun," such as Lord Mengchang and Lord Chunshen. The ancient people also called women's titles "Jun," so using "Lanjun" as a name not only indicates that the beauty is a fragrant herb, different from ordinary grass, but also has the meaning of comparing oneself to ancient people and bestowing glory, which is so elegant and generous. Next, Bai Hong uses the single word "Hong" as her name. Light and energy change into "Hong," dividing into various colors, which is very beautiful. Therefore, naming it "Hong" is also a new rhyme and meaningful. This has the same effect as Zhou Xuan's "Xuanji" named with the word "Xuan". Chen Yunshang's "Yunshang" does not mean "Yunshang Xiapei," belonging to the category of Chang'e the fairy, not something in the human world. Zhou Manhua's "Manhua" has two meanings, "Man" has the meanings of "light and fine" and "slender," and "Hua" can be interpreted as beautiful, which is the same as Wang Xichun, Yuan Meiyun, etc., not breaking the stereotype. Most strange is Zhang Cuihong's "Cuihong", "Cui" means emerald bird, emerald jade, all blue-green colors are called "Cui", both "Cui" and "Hong", what color is this? Checking the dictionary, the tail meat is called "Cui" (Book of Rites, Shuyan Cui). One item, then her "Cui" is interpreted as tail meat, but there is the word "Hong" below, which seems even more wrong, it is not as good as Li Hong using a single word "Hong", which can be interpreted as her red-purple red, or it can be interpreted as her being favored and popular, it feels more straightforward and without grammatical errors, which is much better than Cuihong.</p>
<h3>Group of Heroes Society Volunteer Performance Record</h3>
<p>— Sick Dove</p>
<p>The Qunying Lianhuan Society of this city raised educational funds for the Shishi Elementary School. On the 21st night, a Peking opera rehearsal was held at the Carlton Theatre, with many famous amateurs participating. When the writer arrived at the hospital at nine o'clock, Rong Baojin and Yu Nianci's "Killing the Family by Fishing" had just taken the stage. Although Mr. Rong's Xiao En's voice felt deep and dull, his acting was quite experienced. Paired with the teacher at Yuezhi, improvising funny lines, clever words were like pearls, he was also a comedic talent. It was determined to be Wang Xiaying's "June Snow," with Gai Sanxing's actor playing the old woman. Gai Ling has accompanied famous Beijing Chao-style actors in this play at the Golden Stage many times, an experienced craftsman, naturally extraordinary. Miss Wang's Bao'e has a calm appearance and light steps, which is very much in line with the Qing Yi rules. The skill of the water sleeves has not reached the degree of beauty, the expression on her face is extremely expressive. The opening Yaoban is appropriately modulated, and the slow board of the large segment is sung intermittently, as if weeping and complaining. The tone is purely based on the steep and dangerous to win, deeply obtaining the method of taking and releasing, indulging and capturing. The use of the Cheng cavity combines the Mei flavor, which is due to the guidance of Li Qinxian. In the Fa Court scene, Shi'e's face is not painted with oil, only covered with hair, which is the case for many Kun Dan (female roles) nowadays, which invisibly reduces the terrifying atmosphere. The white speech of "up to the sky there is no way, down to the earth there is no door" is desolate and sad, and it is quite difficult to express it with a soothing and exciting tone. I still remember Zhu Chen performing this, her eyes stopping, her body leaning, making a state of coma, the tragic situation, there is no Kun Dan who has surpassed this. The second half of the Anti-Erhhuang is related to the inner Qi, not seeing the wonderful, the reverse tune is three tones higher than the positive tune, it is not easy to please if you have a good voice, and the insider sees it as a daunting task, how can you deeply blame the amateur actors! The finale "Yellow Crane Tower", Hua Zhenya's Liu Bei, Zhan Xiaoshan's Zhao Yun, Cui Dixian's Zhou Yu, and Zhang Zhesheng's Zhang Fei, are evenly matched and commensurate. Hua Zhenya is famous for his Qipai old Sheng at the time, and is as famous as Zhang Zhongyuan, so every move has a sense of proportion, which cannot be achieved without skill. Cui Dixian is an outstanding talent among amateur young actors. He can perform "Yaguan Tower" and "Eight Hammers" with a single pick, so he acts with ease, without effort, and naturally wonderfully. Zhang Zhesheng's voice is loud and vast, like a yellow bell and a great bell, a Jin Shaoshan in the amateur world. It is a pity that it was late and he did not bring a water battle.</p>
