<p>社評</p>
<h3>德義會談之檢討</h3>
<p>德國外長里賓特洛浦於本月十九日抵達羅馬之後，連日和義相墨索里尼義外長齊亞諾密談數次，官方除發表簡短公報，照例聲言雙方見解一致之外，對於談話的內容和結果，始終沒有正式公佈。據美國通信社的報道，兩國巨頭在這次會談中，已着手起草一種準備在義佔埃及，德佔英倫後實施的「新歐洲秩序」方案：據法國通信社的消息，這次會談的主耍問題，乃是軸心國和蘇聯西班牙兩國關係之檢討，這在德國半官方面，也說除了今後的戰略以外，還曾述及多瑙河和西班牙問題。</p>
<p>關於所謂『新歐洲秩序方案，』在交戰中的德義兩國，或有提前加以商討的可能，但是究竟比較遼遠些；現在既沒有接到更較詳細的情報，我們不必妄贅一詞；據我們所臆測，似乎還是德方的報道比較接近事實，易言之，在德國攻英未見得手，義國攻埃剛剛開始的目前，德義兩國當局所急於要交換意見的，似乎不在將來的利益分配，而在目前問題的應付和今後策略的決定。</p>
<p>交戰國在戰事進行中的第一要務，當然是在注意軍事，這是不必多談的；其次却在拉攏與國和破壞敵方的與國陣綫。德國在去年開戰之前，先拉攏蘇聯，使他成爲「親德的中立國」，這是第一步；今年又使義大利自「非交戰國」變爲參戰國，這是第二步：現在却又輪到拉攏西班牙了。在里賓特洛浦赴義之前，西班牙弗朗哥元首先派他的親信蘇納內長前往柏林，和德國當局接洽，一俟里賓特洛浦返國，據聞還要賡續會談，然後再轉赴羅馬一行；證諸近日所傳西班牙即將正式對英宣戰，以及德義慫恿西國參戰並許以重大報酬之種種風聲，蛛絲馬跡，實在令人不能漠視。假定弗朗哥決定參戰，他一定要求收回直布羅陀港，以破壞英國和地中海乃至東菲的聯鎖關係，這樣對於德義的軍事行動，當然是有莫大利益的，所以德義會談中提到西班牙問題，可說是毫無疑問的。</p>
<p>單單拉攏西班牙做與國，似乎還不夠，因爲在地中海的東部，還有土耳其和希臘兩國，却是英國可能的與國，必須設法把他們拉過來，才可以做到盡善盡美。不過，這是一件不容易的工作；第一，土希都是巴爾幹半島方面比較强盛的國家，如果一定要用武力來征服他們，才能逼他們疎遠英國，那是德義所不樂爲的；因爲德義的打算，是兵不血刃而在巴爾幹方面擴展勢力；過去之鼓勵匈牙利保加利亞瓜分羅馬尼亞，以及事後的扶植羅國鐵衛團，便是這種策略之具體表現；所以除非確有勝算或非此不能自拔，德義絕不致弄假成眞，以分散對英作戰之兵力。第二，巴爾幹是各方利益交錯矛盾得最厲害的地域，歷史上的幾次巴爾幹戰爭都是列强互相傾軋的結果；以目前而論，除了英國在土希兩國的潛勢力之外，蘇聯的關切和企圖，也是德義所不能不顧及的重要對象，過去在瓜分羅馬尼亞的一幕中，就可以看出蘇聯的「一步不放鬆主義」；今後德義不論要在巴爾幹方面作何活動，都有引起蘇聯「對等要求」之可能，此所以德義兩國巨頭在討論多瑙河問題的時候，同時必須檢討一下對蘇態度。</p>
<p>綜上所述，可見德義兩國今後除以重大代價，力圖慫慂西班牙參戰而外，其在巴爾幹方面，還需要一個相當時期的佈置和接洽；這幾天盛傳保加利亞又向希臘要求在答臘斯區劃一走廊，同時義國要求希臘放棄英國保證和阿爾巴尼亞人要求索回齊慕尼亞省的宣傳，也似乎方興未艾，在這種情勢之下，蘇聯的態度，允其是蘇聯和土耳其的關係，却是値得十二分重視的，關於這一點，吾們惟有期待蘇聯當局自已來打破他們暫時的沉默了。</p>
<p>然後回返東京、至日僑之撤離、並非認爲危機已至、實因有轉入惡劣傾向之可能、據西原氏宣稱、若談判確已無望、彼卽擬先赴海防一行、然後回返東京、至於日本所提出之新要求、設不幸一旦遭法國拒絕時、則今後究採何種步驟、應由東京決定之、該日軍代表團領袖、對於外間所傳、日方所提新耍求、已離乎東京與維希協定範圍之揣測、曾予以吾認、並聲明日代表團始終嚴密依附東京維希協定之條件而行事、彼且斥責法國目東京協定於三週前簽訂以來、法方採取拖延態度、屢將日本建議、棄置不顧、當記者詢及美國務卿赫爾前者所爲聲明、對保持安南現狀、頗深關懷時、西原氏答云、安南現狀、並未遭受威脅、安南之完整、亦未被侵害、兼之法日間之關係、猶英美兩國所有之合作也、（二十一日合衆社電）</p>
<p>河內　西原昨曾在保衛森嚴之日軍代表團行署中、接見美國新聞記者、並重復表示、日本人民對於法國之情感、特別友好、日本人民、對於法國毫無反對情緒、（二十一日合衆社電）</p>
<h3>法報對越南談判　著文述經過情形</h3>
<p>克萊蒙費朗城　「小巴黎人報」頃以「越南與法日兩國關係」爲題、載有論文一篇、檢討法日兩國自本年六月十三日起、開始進行談判之經過、其文有白、法屬越南前總督賈德魯將軍、於六月十三日、卽接受日本要求、下令封鎖越南與中國之邊界、並在原則上允與日本淮行商務談判、時隔未久、英國亦徇日本政府之請、封鎖滇緬公路、迨近衛內閣成立之後、外相松岡洋右、復於八月二日、向越南當局要求、准許日軍假道開往中國邊界、法國政府當卽正式予以拒絕、同時因法國往日層受危險的思想之害、亟宜加以遏止、而以實事求是爲尙，爰向日本表示、願就法日一般關係、進行談判、並準備顧及日本在遠東所處特殊地位、此項見解、曾經通知美國政府、但美國態度、頗爲空洞、法日談判、旋由日本外相松岡洋右、與法國駐日大使亨利在東京進行、並卽成立一般性質之協定、此一協定、正常演進之結果、亦不過爲日後雙方在河內談判經濟軍重協定之序幕而已、厥後越南當局與日本代表團主任西原中將進行談判、以冀成立「忠實的諒解」、俾克　足日本要求、同時保全越南之獨立、與法國依照法德兩國停節協定對於越南所保有之主權、要之、吾國海外屬地、仍爲政府所最關切之事、良以各殖民地、均信任法國、患難與共、法國對其完整與繁榮、自當密切加以注視云、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>維希　小巴黎人報、維希政府八月二日接日本第一次所提出假道越南進兵中國之要求時、曾向美國接洽、但偵知美國不能採取切實態度、法國業已正式拒絕日方要求、惟政府不承認日本在遠東之優越地位、以應付現實、談判乃進行、以期成立可供河內據以詳細討論之妥洽、至是越督德古與日代表西原遂開始談話、迄今雙方談話繼續進行、互有覓取諒解之決心、法方一面予日本以法政府所認爲合法之滿意、一面將保障法屬越南之獨立、與法國之主權云、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<h3>英報稱越督地位　最近已愈見困難</h3>
<p>倫敦　泰晤士報今日著論云、法日對於越南締結協定事、英國雖未接有消息、但有理由可信維希政府已在原則上接受東京所提要求之大部、越督德古之地位、已因泰國提出更廣泛之領土耍求而愈見困難、（二十一日路透社電）</p>
<p>河內　越南總督德古中將、頃於各校秋季開學之際、發表吿法國學校同學書、略謂、「當此新學年開始之日、願以一種口號與忠吿、貢獻於越南全境各中小學同學之前、質言之、汝等在此慘痛之時代中、必須具有飲活之勇氣、並須想念祖國曁汝等之父母與故鄕、想念遭遇重大苦難之法蘭西祖國、須知我人之祖國、誠如貝當元首所言、乃永生不減而決不淪亡者、惟是祖國之未來、唯汝等之努力與意旨是頓、自今厥後、汝等必須注意日常工作、嚴守紀律、隨時警策、並在法國同胞與越南土著之間、永保睦誼、法國學校過去業在越南境內完成深刻而又有力之事業、使法國與越南言語統一、思想一致、是以凡我親愛之同學、今後皆有兩重義務、一爲想念祖國、信任祖國、並聽命於祖國、二爲認識法蘭西的越南、維持越南、並爲越南努力是己」云、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>泰國向越南當局　提出新要求三項</h3>

<p>星期增刊英國的「心臟」　　英國的心臟Midlands廣二萬一千方哩，東自北海，南至伯明罕，西達愛爾蘭海，北迄斯托克敦。這一個四方形地域之中，實含蘊着英國的生命素。　　這區地域，在軍要性的意義上，與美國之本薛文尼亞，紐裘賽，與新英格蘭相仿。本薛文尼亞與紐裘賽爲鋼廠，煤礦，軍火工廠的中心區；而銅礦，機器廠，飛機工廠則集中於新英格蘭。這三州在美國的國防工業上佔着非常重要的地位。如果這些地方的工廠，鐵道與公路，迭遭連續不斷的轟炸，或者爲敵軍所佔據，美國作戰的力量就要大受打擊了。　　英國心臟在兩世紀以來，經過產業革命的激動，已一躍而爲世界上最偉大的工業區。其當源和人力，把不列顚的威勢廣播四分之一的地球面，使不列顚於已往一百二十五年間，在商業上執了世界的牛耳。英國人把開發印度所得的剩餘資金，投資在這工業區中，收集了蘇格蘭的羊毛，美國和埃及的棉花，英國本土和瑞士，西班牙的煤鐵，把原料造成了貨物行銷世界各地。　　自從印度，日本和美國自行發展紡織業之後，英國這區的紡織却受到了一部份的損失，但是寳貴的出品也正多着，成爲各種軍器和日用金屬器皿的最大出產地。譬如歇斐爾德出產刀劍利器，精巧儀器，大砲，金屬鋼板，軍火和行船機器；伯明罕出產火車龍頭，鈕扣結婚戒指，機關槍，銅床架子，安全別針，車胎及汽車；斯托克敦至脫侖特間的六個城市中出產各色陶磁器皿；巴羅白根赫特及利物浦的船塢中能製造各種船壳。　　靠東沿海一帶平原間，出產各種英人所需的食品。沿海各港則極富於漁鹽之利。希特勒洞燭這英國心臟地帶，實爲英國國際貿易的推動機紐，開戰之後曾欲把這個地區澈底破壞。實際上說起來，建造英國艦隊以保護不列顚帝國的就在那里。　　該區各項實業，沿着彭寗山脈兩旁發展。在孟却斯德與利滋之間爲山峽所劃分，十九世紀初葉，英人卽就此山峽開鑿運河。（詳見本報歐戰叢談開戰前的英國民間生活）此運河匯通麥爾西，亞耳，及恒伯，諸水，極有利於航運舟楫。彭寗山脈兩　地下之煤鐵之蘊藏量殊爲豐富。工業中心區利滋，歇斐爾德，諾丁亨，竇倍，伯明罕，及孟却斯德等均此山脈蔓延所至。這些城市，烟突高聳天表，日夜煤烟繚繞，爐火熊熊，素有「黑鄉之稱。生長在如此生硬無情趣的環境之中，無怪那些老百姓都是性情倔强異常者流了。諸大城市之問，有公路鐵道的連繫，交通亦極便捷。　　自六月以來，希特勒曾把這個地區作爲轟炸英國的最大目標。德國轟炸機在上空飛翔之時，總能找到些工業上的目標，値得他們投彈毀滅的。鐵路，河道及遝河的交通網間，軍火的運輸頗爲繁頻，如果投彈適中要害，倒也大有影響於軍隊輜巾的供給呢。　　除了倫敦區之外，這區域又是英國航空事業的大本營。利滋是海軍用疾降式轟炸機和戰鬥機的產生地。蘭開夏的斯托克堡地方的一家泛萊航本公司，能製造一種空中魚窗。堤伊河旁吉士德地方的工廠，專造維格式長距離巨型轟炸機，威萊斯雷及及威林呑兩種牌子的飛機卽生產於這個地方。供海岸巡察之用的亞芙洛•愛森式飛機，在孟却斯德及斐爾斯萊綏兩地所造，著名的羅斯•勞埃士引擎產於竇倍。　　利物浦和黑爾兩港，一是接通愛爾蘭海的出口，一是北海恒伯河所經流之要道，爲美國水道心臟地帶，德人在交通破壞上，最着眼於道兩處地方。的克，竇倍，佩得波羅，斯把廷，史丹福，士魯茲巴立，及吉士德諸地的鐵道交叉點最容易遭受轟炸的損傷。恒伯河旁的大葛林十倍平常是一個漁港，在戰時期中，一變而爲魚雷艇的集中營，和巨大油庫的所在地。附近還有接通澳洲的無綫電臺。利滋爲英國肉食和皮革的最大實業區。英國北路陸軍指揮總站設立在的克。　　東海濱南部水量較淺，有許多地方大船不易行駛或靠岸，不過這種現象並不到處皆是。極北之區，在布立特林登以北的海濱，沿岸有絕壁斷崖爲天然的防築工事，岩作綠色，往往高至六百餘尺。但是恒伯河之南，岩石作灰黃色，高度較低，沙灘大概寬廣十碼至二十碼之譜。　　恒伯河中早就埋好了地雷，並也飽有風霜，丹麥人種式的海軍防守耍道。華許河口幾英里長的低平淺灘，究因低淺的緣故，不十分合宜於海軍的登岸。華許河之南芬倫—一切很像荷蘭地方居民高大多髮，風磨凌空，山慈姑到處可見—全地盡是堤壩。靠近海岸的廣坦之區，河溝交織，倒很堅實平坦，直到東愛格萊山脈爲止。　　英人在那裏的防空也相當嚴密，空軍與民用航空機塲，爲數也不算少，儘可進則攻，退則守；人口繁盛城鎭高射砲的佈置，力量亦不算弱。此外沿彭寗山脈兩側，坡度下削，敵機很不容易在那裹降落。彭寗山頂顚人跡罕至，一片野原，除了一部份草地以外，其餘荒草叢莽，無可生存。不過在那裹，傘兵隊也可以找到幾處降落的平地，和掩蔽的所在，然後從山上下來，把村莊間的交通破壞。英人在今年初夏，就發覺在這荒凉野原之間警戒的困難。因爲所可通行的祇是些羊腸徑，而藉資保護的惟有灰色的石牆而已。羅素的敎學自由說（續完）　　有組織的黨化敎育，是當代一大危險。以民族主義的形式出現，則引起國際戰爭，以其他形式出現，則引起內戰。敎師任務，就在置身於黨爭以外，努力灌輸靑年人大公無私的研究習慣，判斷問題的得失，防止其接受片面的理論。敎師旣不應阿諛眾衆的偏見，也不應曲徇官方的隱私。其職業上的道德，應對各方，一秉大公，跳出是非以外，純作客觀的科學研究。其研究的結果雖引起衆怒，亦所不惜。　　然而敎師的任務不僅在淌彌當代熱烈的爭端於無形。他更有應盡的積極任務在，如無盡此項仟務的願望，卽不能成爲當代偉大敎師。故敎師比之其他各階級，更有文明保育者的重責。他們更應深切了解何謂文明，更需對學生敎養成功一種文明的態度。然則何謂文明社會乎？　　此一問題的普通答案，大都以物質的成就爲標準。如一個國家，有很多的機器，很多的汽車，很多的浴室，交通很快，就算是文明國家。惟據我的意見，現代大多數人對於這些東西，過分重視。文明就其更重要的意義講，是一個精神的問題，而不是一個肉體享受的物質問題。故知識佔一部分，情感也占一部分。就有關知識方面講，一個人應該在時間空間上，明瞭其自身及其所處環境對世界的關係。他應視其國家，不僅是他生息的園地，並應視爲世界好多國家中的一個，這些國家同具着平等的生存思想與感覺的權利。　　就情感方面言，如果一個人眞正開明，則亦需擴大範圍，推己及人。人類由生到死，有時幸福，有時不幸，有時慷慨，有時貪慾，錙銖必較；有時英勇，有時怯懦卑微。就其一生言，自有若干事物，卓然特立，値得重視。若干人則爲其愛人類的衝動所激發，若干人則由於其超人知慧帮助吾人了解其所居住的世界；若干人到由於其特殊的敏感，產生美術。這些人產生了於人有益的『善』，遠非歷史長期的殘暴，壓迫及迷信所能及其萬一。這些人在其權力範圍以內，使人類生活較之野蠻人橫行時期，更像樣些。一個文明人，對於有些塲合，不能表示讚同，則應首先明白共眞象，而不應一味指斥。換言之，他應找出罪惡的根源而謀怎樣剷除，不應專事憎恨陷於罪惡中的人。這一切是敎師在理智上情感上應有的認識，唯其有這樣的認識，他才能將此種使命，灌輸於受敎的靑年。　　一個人，除非對於他的學生有熱忱，及以有價値的學識灌輸學生的志願，不能做一個良好的敎師。然而這種態度與宣傳家的態度不同。宜傳家不願他的門徒考察世界形勢及自由選擇有價値的目的。宣傳家像一個園藝專家，欲把學生訓練成欲曲則曲，欲直則直，正如園藝家的培植盆景一樣。他爲欲阻碍門徒們自然發展，不惜摧毀他們高尚的精神，而授之以嫉妒，破壞性及殘暴。人類無須殘暴；我相信大多數的殘暴，皆由早年敎育不當，允其是誤入不良的歧途的結果。　　壓迫與虐殺的狂熱，極爲普遍，目前世界各處，皆不乏其例。但這並非人性中不可少的部分。反之，我認爲這是出於某種不幸。這又是敎師的任務，開闊學生的眼界，指示他們人類尚有其他大衆所歡迎同時有利於人的行動，因此，應令其良善的本能充分發展，而阻止剝奪他人快樂的慾望的生長。若干人非難幸福的目的是爲己同時亦爲人，爲公共目的而放棄個人幸福，固爲一事，視大衆幸福爲無址輕重又爲事。但後者的行動，常以虛僞英勇行動的名義出之。那些採取此一態度的人，大致含有殘暴的意味在內，而此項行動的成因，或由於不自覺的嫉忌，而此項嫉忌的來源，常發生於兒童或靑年時代。敎育家之目的，就在訓練成年人解除此項心理上的不幸，及養成不願妨害別人幸福的心理。　　據當前事實所昭示，好多敎師不能盡量做到共能盡的責任。所以如此者，有好多理由，有些比較是偶然的，有些則屬根深蒂固的因襲。大部分敎師授課太多，結果以訓誨學生完成考試，就算了事，而不願予學生以自由的心理訓練。不從事敎書的人，不曉得敎書所費的精力。牧師不需每天宣敎幾小時，但敎却得每天有幾小時的工作，結果大多數敎師苦惱非凡，變爲　經過敏，不能對於他們所敎授的最新出版的敎材，加以研究，也不能鼓勵他們的學生，發生興趣，以獲得新理想及新知識。　　三，　　但這還不是最嚴重的問題。在好多國家中，某種意見算是對的，其他算是危險的。被認爲意見不對的敎師，於是國家希望其對於那項意見，保持沉默。如果他們提到了他們的意見，那就是宣傳”而只有提到國家認爲對的意見，才算是妥善的敎授。結果是好學深思的靑年，時常出了敎室以後，不能正確認識當代傑出的思想。允共在公民一項科目，比之共他科目，其敎授的目的，更在引人走入五里霧中。授於靑年的政治知識，乃政治上想當然耳的老生常談，而把一切實際從政的眞相皆故意隱蔽不宣。靑年人長成了以後，發現其眞實內幕，結果甚易造成憤世嫉俗的現象，而一切社會的理想都失去；如果最初卽授以眞理，並予以適當的說明，他們也許可以變爲富有朝氣，敢向一切罪惡挑戰，而不像他們現在一樣，對於罪惡的存在，只是，聳一聳肩，默許共存在了。　　啓發虛僞，變爲樹立敎育制度者一種牢不可破的罪惡。我認爲一個人，必須決心在其敎學中，不抹煞眞理，才能成爲好的敎師。由於掩沒眞理而產生的道德，其本身是脆弱的，在一觸到實際時，就會宣告失敗的。通常認爲明白事實的眞相，足以引人陷於憤世嫉俗，允其這一項的過程，是突如其來。但如果是逐漸明白其理，而同時明白何者爲善，及由於獲得眞理的衝動，從事科學的研究，以求明白眞相，卽可無此不良結果。總之，對於無判別能力的靑年說謊，在道德上是無可辯護的罪惡。　　如果欲令民主政治存在，敎師對其學生最要做到的事，首先是對於那些與我們意見不同的人，發生一種容忍的態度。這也許是一種人類自然的衝動，對於一切與我們平常不同的習慣風俗，常存恐怖與厭惡之感。螞蟻與野　人常置外來者於死地。那些從未遊歷國外，或與國外有精神接觸的人，很難容忍那些屬於另一國家，另一時代，另一敎派，或另一政黨的奇異行動與信仰。此項出於無知的不能容忍態度，是與文明前途立於敵對地位，而為吾人人口稠密世界最嚴重的危險。　　敎育制度對此應加糾正，但目前敎育制度對此却盡力很少。在每一國家，民族情感皆加鼓勵，而使學生相信別國中人，無論在道德上及在智力上，皆較本國為低。人類感情中最瘋狂最惡毒的集體憂　病，不加禁止，而反加鼓勵，同時欲靑年人深信不疑者，亦為此項無理性根據之事。對於這一切，敎師不尸其咎。因為他們無敎授其心中抱負的自由。他們深切了解靑年的需要，他們與靑年有經常接觸，但他們無瓜決定何者應敎授，應用何種方法敎授。因此之故我，敎育事業，應有比目前所享有的更多的自由。　　敎師正如藝術家，哲學家與文學家一樣，只有在其直接受個人內心創造的衝衝下，不受外界支配與束縛，才能充分盡其任務。然而在現代世界中，已無個人存在的餘地。個人可以在極權國家中，以獨裁者的姿態出現於最上層，或在工業發達的國家中，以富豪的姿態出現，但在知識的園地，保持獨立生存於控制現代生活的一切組織勢力以外，已愈趨愈難。如果世界不願失去它的最有貢獻的智力，則應不顧組織勢力，而設法令其有自由活動餘地。這意義就是講，那些有權力及明白對某此地人應予以自由的人，應深思遠慮，對其權力自加約束。文藝復興與時代的敎皇，對於文藝復興時代的藝術家，就有這種自覺，但當代的有權者，對於特殊天才，似乏崇敬之忱。或許我們等到較平靜的時代到來後，對文明的要求，始能克服對政黨精神的要求。同時若干人應明白組織的成就極屬有限。每一制度，應令其有伸縮餘地，不然，必使人性中最優秀的一切，有趨於消淶的一天。羅素與學生談話</p>

<p>兒童周刊怎樣在圖書館裏看書  楊春綠　　　假使你的學校裏，有一所完備的圖書館，那是你無上的幸福。因為圖書館是知識的寶庫，那裏藏着許多寶貴的書籍，供給我們去借閱，以補教科書的不足。　　但是，我們怎麼樣利用圖書館呢？我們到圖書館裹去借書，先要翻閱圖書目錄，選擇自己歡喜閱讀的圖書，塡寫一張借書單，註明自己姓名，所借書名，號數，起借日期等，然後向管理員借書。　　看書的時候，要專心一志，有始有終，才能獲益。最好隨時做筆記；筆記可以幫助我們的記憶，增進我們的心得。　　看好了，將圖書還給管理員，並且收回借書單。借到館外看的書，時期大概都有限制的，普通以一星期為限。到期尙未看完的，須向管理員續借，逾期歸還，就要受罰。　　看報，不必有甚麼手續。但看過之後，仍要歸還原處。　　還有，在圖書館裏看書，應該注意的幾件事：　　一：要遵守圖書館的一切規則，並聽從管理員的指導。　　二：出入脚步要輕；搬動椅子，也不能發出大的聲音。　　三：閱書時，要坐得端正，腰背挺直。　　四：不要同時取閱兩種圖書。　　五：在館內，不可高聲朗讀，更不得談笑，爭論。　　六：不耍用唾液去翻書，或把書角折捲，更不可塗汚和撕　　毀圖書；如有損壞，須照價賠償。　　親愛的小朋友！假使你要增長知識，就應該常常到那「知識的寳庫」中去走走！葉落的緣故  金箴　　一陣秋風一陣雨，把炎夏殘餘的熱蒸汽，吹散到遙遠的地方去了，凉快的空氣便替代了熱氣的地域，於楚在地上的生物又起了一番變動—蟬聲歇了，變了秋虫的鼓疊翼；人在單薄衣衫上，再加上了一件衣；茂盛的樹木，染上了一層衰黃的色彩；更有一張張的老黃葉，經不起風雨的吹打，便簌簌地脫離老家而飄落到地上來，這一幅變動的情景，確實地表明秋是早已來了。阿明當然也感覺到秋意的凉快。更眼見到庭國中的樹上葉片，確慢慢地飛落下來，便有意和阿明打趣地問道：「秋天一到，爲什麼葉會變黃？更會飄落下來」？　　「這有什麼多問！因爲一到了秋天，樹上的葉一定會落下來的，這是必然的現象。」阿慧似乎在笑他哥哥的蠢笨而回答着。　　「我知道葉到秋天會落下的，這倒底是什麼道理？」阿明便更接口問着，這時阿慧實在是被問得說不出話來，就想乘此到廚房裏去，却被阿明拉住了。　　「你不明瞭這個，倒也不要緊，可不要走呀。我可以告訴你，給你一個滿意的答覆。的確，這個問題是不容易回答。入秋以後，樹葉會變黃而凋落，似乎樹葉自春經夏而到秋，，它對樹木的任務已告完畢，自可漸漸枯槁，枯葉對於樹木旣無利益，那落去亦不要緊，這種說法，也不算錯，不過太不切實。我們須先知道葉在樹木的生活史中，究竟佔着什麼地位？要知樹葉是樹木製造養料的機關，它吸收空氣中的氧氣和二氧化碳氣，由根中吸收地中的水，這三份原料，一同彙集在葉片上，葉中更含有葉綠素，這是營同化作用的機器，再用陽光的原動力，於是製成養料，這種作用，大多在春夏兩季，發生得最繁。養料製成伐，便要輸送到樹根和樹幹中，這都發生在秋季。已製成的養料，一部分貯蓄在根和莖一部分便分解而利用，當分解時，就產生一種能，這能就是吸取陽光，而得到的，而樹木的發育生長便需要能。所以春季是製養料時期，秋季是分解和輸送養料的時期，夏季則幾種作用都有。分解時的廢物也由樹葉排泄到幹外，所以葉是製造養料和排泄廢物的塲所，對於樹木當是很緊要的。葉落的緣故是節省樹木內無益的消費，而牠養料貯藏起來，預備來春欣欣向榮，所以葉落，完全是樹木實行節的運動呀！」敏兒不愛蟋蟀了  王滄萍　　蟋蟀是我們英勇的戰士，去年的秋犬，敏兒養了幾頭驍勇善戰的蟋蟀，在每個瓦盆上，貼着常勝將軍無敵大將等等的封號，他隨時隨地很謹慎的豢養着，非常寳貴。待到秋末冬初，天氣一陣陣的寒冷了，這幾頭雄糾糾的大將，竟敵不住寒冷的襲擊，不的而同的行動呆滯了；叫聲亦軟弱無力了。這種棟的表現，無異向敏兒發出乞憐的哀鳴。敏兒當然着急，忙向母親要了不少新棉花，很小心的舖在瓦盆底下，可是微弱的小生命，還是受不住冷氣的煎迫，幾天以內，相繼僵死了。敏兒悲傷之後，只好把它們埋葬起來。　　今年敏兒已經十二歲了，他的智識及觀念，跟着年齡有着長足的進步，他準確地覺得比蟋蟀更驍勇有意義的戰士。所以今年的敏兒，深深地覺得，應該把熱愛蟋蟀的心，整個的移動了。　　當前正是秋風，報上載着徵集寒衣，敏兒把積下來的二元錢，很高興的送去，充作捐款了。秀蘭鄧波兒傳（十五）  民　　可甘，你聽着，我是這樣得到一個很好的機會的。有一天，媽媽總得喬治韋德先生替爾克斯公司攝製一部叫做「恥辱」的影片，需要許多小女孩子擔任歌舞的節目。我們得到了他辦公處的一個電話，就急忙趕去了。那時足足有三百多個女孩子，由伊們的媽媽或代理人伴同前來，早就報到，所以我們沒法接近韋德先生。媽媽是失望得什麼似的。但是後來却有一位先生向我們走來，據說他是導演，名喚李歐霍克。他對媽媽說先前曾瞧過「嬰兒把戲」，所以一見我就認出來了。他說我過去的成緩，是很不錯的，以後一定要給我幫忙。他又對媽媽說，在韋德先生這部「恥辱」影片中，怕沒有什麼太失望。這一次的召集，不過要試騐一下，看他們要決定了需要小女孩子的時候，可有多少人應召而來；如今却是還未決定哩。末了霍克先生又說他們不久要攝製別的影片，也許需要像我這樣的一個女孩子，到那時再給我設法好了。同時他也很想瞧一瞧那部「青年玩意」，看我表演得怎麼樣？　　有一晚，我和爸爸媽媽到倍佛來山一家影戲院去參觀「靑年玩意」第二部的預映，霍克先生也果然來了；和他同來的，是一位歌曲作家高南先生。據高南先生對爸爸媽媽說，威爾羅吉士先生新近有一個計劃，打算攝製一部偉大的音樂影片，由希漢先生擔作監製，請華納裴克士德，梅琪伊文絲，的翰鮑爾斯，傑密鄧恩諸明星合演，早已決定了。這部影片中，也需要一個小女孩子，扮演　密鄧恩的女兒，地位雖並不重要，却也要聰朋伶俐的孩子，才可加入這個堅强的陣綫。他對媽媽說，明天倘帶我到攝影塲去，可以介紹我見一見幫助希漢先生監製和作曲的劉白朗先生。他說　與白朗先生相見，也是一件挺好的事，因爲他當初曾發見賈克古柏，賈克因此成名，這一回也許要「發見」我哩。我們聽了這話，都笑起來了；爸爸更笑得厲害，說發見美洲的哥侖布可惜死了，不然的話，也許早就會「發見」我了。　　第二天我們在攝影塲中就見到了劉白朗先生，媽媽坐在那裹只是微笑，霍克和高南兩位就把我先前所演過的影片告知白朗先生，當下白朗先生對我說道：「秀蘭，且看你的本領怎麼樣？」於是有人在鋼琴上奏起聖路易樂曲來，我依着拍子舞了一下，又學着前幾天在無綫電機中羅第萬利歌唱的作風，低低的唱了起來。他瞧了之後，很爲驚異，卽忙說道：這就決定了！」他願意和我簽訂合同，派我在片中擔任那小女兒的角色。果然，劉白朗先生是「發見」我了！小學生作文的幾種毛病  夢白　　由於幾年來在小學裏担任國語科教師的緣故，就觀察所得，知道目前大多數的小學生，上作文課每是犯下面的幾種毛病。　　（一）不肯仔細想　一個題目到了手，笨的學生在嚷不好做，聰明的事實上能够寫一些，但不肯用心，祇要做滿了幾行，就此交卷，不管內容寫得好不好。　　（二）字跡太潦草　近來一般的小學生，對於寫字，多半不大高明。在作文簿上，字寫得潦草的居多，像他們的心，最好用鉛筆或自來水筆寫，用毛筆寫字最怕。其實作文簿上，應當寫正楷的。　　（三）歡喜簡寫字　正楷都寫不好，可是專門歡喜寫草字或簡寫字，甚至寫得七差八搭，新來的敎師批卷時會看不出什麼字。所謂先學跑，慢學走，字再也寫不好的了！　　（四）時常要塗改　多數小學生，作文懶得用草稿紙，如果不用草稿能够一直寫下去，不加改竄，原也可以。但時常要寫錯而任意塗改作文簿上，在留出的一行空格裹塗滿了字，使敎師枇改時沒有地方寫。　　（五）賓主不分淸有的小學生，對於每一段落，每一文句的賓主，分不淸楚。其實每一段，每一句，都有賓主。甚至上文用他或你，下文用他們或你們，諸如此類的錯誤，時常可發現。　　任何人知道，如果作文而犯了上面的幾種毛病，就再也不會進步。何况除了上面幾種，其餘的毛病還多。所以筆者希望一般小學生，能擊把這些毛病改去，才能使作文進步。</p>

<p>㳺藝界愛克司光影戲  華志　　電影藝術發明迄今，雖只短短的數十年，却已有了長足的進步，譬如由無聲變爲有聲，由單色變爲彩色，由平面變爲立體，可謂極視聽之娛。新近在試騐中的，是把無嗅味的變爲有嗅味，卽所謂嗅覺電影」；父有不用膠片，利用廣播的無綫電傳影一凡此都已耳熟能詳，接踵而來的，又有「透明電影卽愛克司光影戲一，則提及者尚少。　　原來高速度X光照相的發明，可以拍攝百分之一秒的景物的動作，貫穿景物的內部組織。美國威斯丁地方某工稈院的技師史拉克，新近利用X光製造特種光管，已告初步成功。當它裝到鏡頭下的時候，透過景物的表裏，蔚爲一種奇異的景像。　　這種新奇的發明正在積極試騐中，內容是極端的秘密，不過好萊塢的製片商早已期待，預備出資購買它的攝製權。從大體說來，X光影戲拍製繁複，上演的時間，不會很長，非有特別的節目，如精彩的足球，網球，高爾夫球比賽，可用慢動作表現球的進行路錢，此猶不足爲奇，逢到海陸軍操練的時候，大砲怎樣從砲管裹爆炸，衝出管口，機關槍彈怎樣在空中進行，乃至榴彈如何爆發，X光影戲都可淸楚的演映出來，現時的影戲對於開放檢砲，只見白烟一縷，轟然一聲，十九都是僞裝的，與此當有大巫小巫之別了。　　總之，X光影戲對於拍攝戰爭片神怪片，或科學冒險片，當有不少幫助。它究竟發展到什麼程度，吾人只好拭目以待了。海外藝壇近事錄  鏞　　（一）　　最近柏林當局在一决招待外國新聞記者的席上，曾放映過幾卷新聞片，片中是介紹德軍入荷蘭第一商港鹿特丹（Rotterdam）時的飛機動態。散席後，有一位美國新聞記者告訴人家說：「我在畫面上，竟不能看到鹿特丹區內有一幢房屋是受飛機的轟炸而遭損毀。一可是後來據路透社的電傳：「該城受德國飛機轟炸的結果，人民的死亡，市容的蹂躪，是不能拿言語或筆墨來形容的。」從這裹我們可以認淸，德國的新聞片，其唯一目的是利用作爲宣傳工具而已，它所表現的決非是一種眞實的新聞　　（二）　　牛津大學是英國的最高學府，二個月前，曾由該大學未滿二十一歲的男女學生，爲募捐法國駐英某救濟會的基金，借了一家倫敦最聞名的影院，演過一次戲劇，所演的劇本就叫：「在二十一之下」“Undor　Twenty-one”　　（三）　　派拉蒙公司的新聞片，不久後將不准再在日本各地影院上映，這是東京官塲方面所宣佈的。據聞，此項命令在本年秋季卽須實行；以後日本銀幕上的新聞片係完全由日本影商所組織的公司供給，而歸外商發行的新聞片將一律化被禁映之列。（附註：派拉蒙駐滬當局對於此項消息尚未獲得報告，故至今尚未正式承認。）　　（四）　　英國自開戰以來，對於各項稅額，無不盡量增加，而影院方面最近亦受該國財政部的通知，要在他們的營業上抽出大部份作爲國家應付緊急時的財源；爲了這個緣故，全國影商現在已決定採取提高票價的唯一辦法，此種現象在英國的電影界史上，可以說是未見前例的。「海國英雄」演員陣容　集各雷影公司演員之大成　擇星期五晚塲在璇宮獻演  禾肯　　集各雷影公司演員之大成　擇星期五晚塲在璇宮獻演　　魏如晦吳永剛再度合作編導的「海國英雄」，是賡續「葛嫩娘」中第二幕鄭成功出走後赴臺灣起義的悲壯事躍。自從「新藝劇社」成立以來，魏如晦就從事於這四幕悲壯劇的編寫，半年於茲，六易原稿，在前個月才全部脫稿。　　「新藝劇社」是集各電影公司演員之大成而組織起來的，在接到油印本之後，就分AB制排練（恐怕與公司拍戲工作衝突），一面就由負責人開始接洽演出地盤，最早外間喧傳的卡爾登，果然是理想的地點，但因故沒有成功。於是依舊和「葛嫩娘」的紀念地璇宮劇院合作，於二十七日（星期五）晚塲起連演一星期。　　「海國英雄」的演員陣容是：隆武帝（司馬英才），曾后（丁芝），鄭芝龍（徐立，裴冲，賀賓）鄭成功（劉瓊），滄兒（朱寄萍），郭必昌（屠光啓），董氏—成功妻（沈浩，顧蘭君），博洛（周起，奚蒙，章志直）鄭經—成功子（錢毅），張名振（舒適），鄭瑜—成功女陳琦）馬金子（嚴斐）……全體演員七十餘人其數額之多，爲「怒吼吧中國」後所僅見。紀陳德霖之桃李  梅花館主　　連日讀病鳩唯唯二君紀「王門桃李」，所有涉乃陳德霖之門牆諸節，均屬非是。二十二日病鳩補遺文內，謂「王（蕙芳）姜（妙香）梅（蘭芳）尚（小雲）四人，雖稱德霖弟子，而亦未執贄受業，德霖眞正弟子，僅王琴儂一人耳」。云云，亦屬錯誤。按石頭生前所收學生共計九人，民初入門者，爲王瑤卿王琴儂王蕙芳梅蘭芳姜妙香姚玉芙六人，（以上六人，與乃師曾合攝一影，老師中坐，六弟子分决後立，此影曾由蘭芳命照相館放大，並託某美術師用綢緞加製袍褂，貼於照片之上，遠望之頗覺像眞，此照製成　，山六弟子聯名送與老師，作爲永久紀念，現此照仍懸石頭大廳中。）民十後續收者爲將君稼黃桂秋二人，晚年又收一崑弋名旦韓君靑，（世昌）君靑而後，卽從此關門。　玉霜簃主程硯秋，亦時向石頭請益，石頭對於硯秋，且非常愛悅，凡有所問，無不詳爲啓導，故硯秋亦可算得是陳氏嫡傳弟子之一也。藝華新人夏舫近影  （秦泰來攝）霍桑探案舞后的歸宿  程小青著　　第七章　「把他押起來」　　霍桑不答，忽探頭向轉灣處望望，隨卽又回過來。我心頭也突突亂跳，原來先一次，我們在這裏談話時，那個大搖大擺的人，就是趙伯雄，也就是開槍打霍桑的人。因着這案子的發展，似乎已從複雜而趨於簡單，同時也由懸疑而進入緊張階段。　　霍桑又低聲問道：「你在那裹瞧見他？」　　阿根也低聲說道：「就在這裹——五層樓。」他用手指向下層指了一指。「剛才我到五層樓去找小李，忽然瞧見這個人，我起初還不在意。不料他從我身邊走過以後，又回過頭來向我釘了一眼，才使我想起剛才我跟你在七七六號近邊談話時，也曾瞧見過他。我再回想，便認得出這個人就是住在七七四號裹的姓錢的。」　　「你從什麼上認得出是他？」　　「他的下頷特別方闊，兩隻眼睛也有些怕人，這是，我見慣的；而且他的身村也同樣高大。不過當時我還不敢就相信是他。我我到了小李，才證明我沒有瞧錯——小李是五層樓的茶房，五十四號。」　　「怎樣證明？」　　「小李說他是在十八號夜裹兩點鐘光景到旅館的。霍先生，我已告訴你過，他在十八號半夜以後冒雨回來，就整理了他的皮包，付了房錢，乘電梯下去。我還以爲他已離開這裹，誰知他不過換到了五層樓去。」　　「他此刻住在五層樓幾號？」　　「五五六號，不過又換了一個姓，姓孫。」　　「你在什麼時候瞧見他的？——此刻快近十二點了。」　　「還不到一刻鐘。我一瞧見他，馬上趕上來，打電話到你府上去。」（一一四）</p>

<h3>Although Japan Changes Scope of Demands, Tensions in Vietnam Remain High; French Officials Believe Agreement Possible Soon; Rumor of Sino-French Agreement on Military Cooperation in Kunming</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: According to reliable Chinese sources, Japan recently demanded the right for its troops to land anywhere in Vietnam without a limit on the number of soldiers. It is reported that Chongqing has requisitioned telegraph and other transportation matters between Chongqing and Kunming for military use. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: A Hong Kong dispatch reports that, according to credible sources, China and France recently held secret talks in Kunming, discussing military cooperation measures in the event of a Japanese invasion of Vietnam. At that time, the French side would not oppose Chinese troops entering Vietnamese territory. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>Hanoi: According to French officials here last night, after Japan altered the scope of its final demands on Annam, French-Japanese negotiations resumed yesterday and are progressing well. French officials are even impressed that the outcome of these consultations may lead to an agreement being reached soon, possibly before the "midnight of doom" deadline this Sunday. As for the nature of Japan's demands, it has not been revealed as of yesterday. It is only known that the most important condition is Japan's desire to obtain naval and air bases in Annam. Regarding how Japan changed the scope of its demands, official circles are tight-lipped. However, it is generally speculated that there will be no concessions on important points, and French officials indicate that this agreement may be reached this weekend, giving equal rights and interests to both France and Japan. Observers here believe that the sudden change in attitude of French officials is clearly influenced by French Foreign Minister Baudouin's statement in Vichy this week. The statement implied that Britain and the United States would not provide France with any substantial assistance in resisting Japan's aggression in Annam. (United Press, 21st)</p>
<p>Hanoi: Regarding the current French-Japanese negotiations, the scope of Japan's demands has been altered, and both sides are actively continuing negotiations in a more favorable environment. An agreement can be reached in a short period of time, taking into account each other's interests. Regarding this, responsible sources claim that during the negotiations, the territorial integrity of Vietnam and French sovereignty have never been in question. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Hanoi: Because the Vietnamese government openly declared that Japan's recent demands had forced the negotiations into a stalemate, the situation in Vietnam suddenly turned critical today. The Vietnamese government's communique announced the rejection of Japan's recent demands and strongly stated that, based on recent instructions from the Vichy government, the Vietnamese government can only take a firm stance. The leader of the Japanese delegation, Major General Nishihara, and his entourage have left for Haiphong. French troops have implemented emergency preparations, awaiting orders to act. Vietnamese trains are also prepared to evacuate women and children to the south in the event of an emergency. The Vietnamese government's communique stated that the negotiations resumed yesterday had gradually reached a resolution, but when the agreement was about to be concluded, the Japanese side raised new demands, causing the negotiations to fall into a stalemate. The Vietnamese government's communique did not mention the content of Japan's new demands, but it is believed that the demands that the French cannot accept include (1) the occupation of Hanoi by 20,000 Japanese troops, (2) the management of the Lang Son and Lao Cai railway sections, and (3) the use of the Gia Lam airfield near Hanoi. (United Press, 21st)</p>
<p>New York: The New York Times Washington correspondent claims that the US State Department believes that the urgency of Japan's invasion of Vietnam may be the most difficult immediate problem in US foreign relations. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Japan Times stated in an editorial today that the Japan-Vietnam conference is not related to the United States. It stated, "Whatever understanding is reached between Japan and the Vietnamese authorities only concerns Tokyo and Hanoi." Regarding Washington's claim that the United States cannot tolerate Japan changing the status quo in Vietnam, the newspaper said that since the American people have no substantial interests in Vietnam and the attitude taken by the United States in the past was very distant, "Isn't it strange that they suddenly feel interested in this matter?" It should be noted that the newspaper's tone has always been regarded as a reflection of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' views. (United Press, 21st)</p>
<p>French Cabinet Holds Meeting to Review Situation in Far East</p>
<p>Vichy: The French Cabinet held a meeting here last night to review the situation in the Far East. Before the meeting, the French government announced that it had received a "strong invitation" from Japan to end the protracted French-Japanese negotiations on Vietnam. It is announced here that the French government has already decided to end the negotiations as much as possible in order to control Japan. It is believed here that the delay in negotiations in Hanoi, Tokyo, and Vichy is the result of the French insistence on respecting Vietnam's independence and integrity, and French sovereignty in the colony, in the new military and economic agreement. It is said that Tokyo's "strong invitation" requires the negotiations to be concluded "within days." French officials here did not confirm external reports that the Japanese note was a final ultimatum, expiring at midnight on Sunday. Informed sources here believe that, as a result of last night's cabinet meeting, an agreement may be reached with Japan this afternoon or at the latest by Sunday, accommodating most of Japan's demands. French Foreign Minister Baudouin told American reporters yesterday that, given France's current situation, it may recognize Japan's power in the Far East, because Britain and the United States have both failed to agree to provide Vietnam with material assistance in the event of a Japanese invasion of French territory. (United Press, 21st)</p>
<p>People in Chongqing Observe Vietnam Situation, Fear French Will Succumb</p>
<p>Chongqing: After the news that Japan had presented Vietnam with a new ultimatum, demanding that 25,000 Japanese soldiers transit through the country and establish naval and air bases, with a deadline of midnight on Sunday, reached here, everyone paid close attention to the situation in Vietnam. It is believed that Vichy's statement accepting Japan's demands and the issuance of Japan's final ultimatum are adding final pressure to Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux. Although Decoux has adopted a firm stance, he is isolated and weak, and it is feared that he will eventually succumb. If Japanese troops land, Vietnam will be quickly occupied, because Vietnam's military strength is weak and may not be able to offer effective resistance. Chinese military vehicles are preparing in great secrecy, but it is rumored that Chinese trucks are now gathering on the Yunnan-Guizhou border, and over 200,000 elite troops of the Central Army, led by the most capable senior officers, are now guarding key border areas. Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin recently flew to Kunming twice to inspect defense work. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>Hundreds of Japanese Residents Begin to Evacuate from Hanoi</p>
<p>Hanoi: Japanese residents began evacuating yesterday morning. Hundreds of people have already taken special trains to Haiphong and transferred to Japanese ships. Personnel from the Japanese Consulate and members of the monitoring group will also leave somewhat later. On the day the Japanese residents boarded the train, Japanese Consul General Suzuki led the Japanese residents in singing the Japanese national anthem. Japanese Chief Representative Nishihara commented on the Japan-Vietnam negotiations, saying that when he is sure that the negotiations are hopeless, he will leave. At that time, you can say that the crisis has arrived. What kind of development will occur after he leaves Vietnam can only be said by the Japanese government. Now he is on very friendly terms with the French authorities, and the talks are very intimate. Japan has not made new demands, but wants convenience for the war against China, such as military and air bases. The Japanese attitude does not threaten the territorial integrity of Vietnam or French sovereignty, but Japan is convinced that the situation requires a final resolution of Japan's military needs in Vietnam within a deadline. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>Hanoi: Yesterday morning, a total of 147 Japanese residents and members of the delegation sang the Japanese national anthem and shouted "Banzai" before taking a special train to Haiphong. However, although the Japanese residents were leaving Hanoi in droves yesterday, their attitude was quite confident, especially the delegates. When the members of the Japanese delegation left the hotel where they were staying in Hanoi, they gave the waiters Japanese yen as tips for drinks, saying that in the near future, the Japanese currency system will be commonly used in Annam. (United Press, 21st)</p>
<p>Hanoi: The leader of the Japanese military delegation, Mr. Nishihara, told reporters yesterday that French-Japanese negotiations are progressing smoothly in a sincere atmosphere, and it is hoped that yesterday's tense situation will be alleviated. Nishihara said yesterday that if the French-Japanese negotiations break down, he is prepared to leave, first to Haiphong,</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Review of the German-Italian Talks</h3>
<p>After German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop arrived in Rome on the 19th of this month, he held several days of secret talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. Aside from issuing a brief official communique stating, as usual, that the two sides' views were consistent, the content and results of the talks have not been officially announced. According to reports from American news agencies, the two leaders have begun drafting a "New European Order" plan to be implemented after Italy occupies Egypt and Germany occupies Britain. According to news from French news agencies, the main issue of this meeting was a review of the relationship between the Axis powers and the Soviet Union and Spain. In the German semi-official view, in addition to future strategies, the Danube and Spanish issues were also mentioned.</p>
<p>Regarding the so-called "New European Order Plan," it is possible that the warring Germany and Italy may discuss it in advance, but it is still relatively distant. Since we have not received more detailed information, we do not need to speculate. According to our conjecture, it seems that the German reports are closer to the truth. In other words, with Germany's attack on Britain not yet successful and Italy's attack on Egypt just beginning, what the German and Italian authorities are anxious to exchange opinions on seems not to be the distribution of future interests, but the handling of current problems and the determination of future strategies.</p>
<p>The primary task of belligerents during wartime is, of course, to pay attention to military affairs, which need not be discussed. The second task is to win over allied countries and undermine the enemy's alliance. Before the outbreak of the war last year, Germany first won over the Soviet Union, making it a "pro-German neutral country." This was the first step. This year, it turned Italy from a "non-belligerent country" into a belligerent country. This was the second step. Now it is Spain's turn to be won over. Before Ribbentrop went to Italy, Spanish General Franco first sent his confidant Suner to Berlin to negotiate with the German authorities. As soon as Ribbentrop returns home, it is said that the talks will continue, and then he will go to Rome. Judging from the recent rumors that Spain is about to officially declare war on Britain and that Germany and Italy are encouraging Spain to participate in the war and promising significant rewards, the clues are really impossible to ignore. Assuming that Franco decides to participate in the war, he will definitely demand the recovery of the Port of Gibraltar in order to disrupt Britain's interlocking relationship with the Mediterranean and even East Africa. This would, of course, be of great benefit to the military actions of Germany and Italy, so it can be said that there is no doubt that the Spanish issue was mentioned in the German-Italian talks.</p>
<p>It seems that simply winning over Spain as an ally is not enough, because in the eastern Mediterranean, there are still Turkey and Greece, which are possible allies of Britain. We must find a way to pull them over in order to achieve perfection. However, this is not an easy task. First, Turkey and Greece are relatively strong countries in the Balkan Peninsula. If they must be conquered by force in order to force them to alienate Britain, that is something that Germany and Italy are unwilling to do, because Germany and Italy plan to expand their power in the Balkans without bloodshed. The past encouragement of Hungary and Bulgaria to divide Romania, as well as the subsequent support of the Romanian Iron Guard, are concrete manifestations of this strategy. Therefore, unless there is a sure chance of winning or they cannot extricate themselves, Germany and Italy will never make it real, so as to disperse their forces for the war against Britain. Second, the Balkans is the region where the interests of all parties are intertwined and the contradictions are the most serious. The Balkan Wars in history were the result of great powers fighting each other. As far as the current situation is concerned, in addition to Britain's potential influence in Turkey and Greece, the Soviet Union's concern and attempts are also important objects that Germany and Italy cannot ignore. In the past scene of dividing Romania, we can see the Soviet Union's "no step is let go" principle. In the future, no matter what activities Germany and Italy want to do in the Balkans, they may cause the Soviet Union to make "equal demands." This is why the two leaders of Germany and Italy must review their attitude towards the Soviet Union at the same time when discussing the Danube issue.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that in the future, in addition to trying to encourage Spain to participate in the war at a heavy price, Germany and Italy still need a considerable period of arrangement and negotiation in the Balkans. These days, it has been widely reported that Bulgaria is again asking Greece for a corridor in the Thrace region. At the same time, Italy's demand that Greece abandon British guarantees and Albanians' propaganda that they want to reclaim Ciamuria seems to be in full swing. Under this situation, the Soviet Union's attitude, especially the relationship between the Soviet Union and Turkey, is worth twelve points of attention. Regarding this point, we can only expect the Soviet authorities to break their temporary silence themselves.</p>
<p>And then return to Tokyo. The evacuation of Japanese residents is not because they think the crisis has arrived, but because there is a possibility of turning into a bad tendency. According to Mr. Nishihara, if the negotiations are indeed hopeless, he plans to go to Haiphong first, and then return to Tokyo. As for the new requirements put forward by Japan, if France unfortunately refuses them, then what steps will be taken in the future should be decided by Tokyo. The leader of the Japanese military delegation denied the outside speculation that the new requirements put forward by the Japanese side have deviated from the scope of the Tokyo-Vichy agreement, and stated that the Japanese delegation has always strictly followed the conditions of the Tokyo-Vichy agreement. He also criticized France for adopting a delaying attitude since the Tokyo-Vichy agreement was signed three weeks ago, repeatedly ignoring Japan's suggestions. When reporters asked about US Secretary of State Hull's previous statement that he was deeply concerned about maintaining the status quo in Annam, Mr. Nishihara replied that the status quo in Annam has not been threatened, the integrity of Annam has not been violated, and the relationship between France and Japan is like the cooperation between the United Kingdom and the United States.

<p>Hanoi: Nishihara met with American reporters yesterday in the heavily guarded Japanese military delegation's office and reiterated that the Japanese people have a particularly friendly feeling towards France and that the Japanese people have no opposition to France. (United Press, 21st)</p>
<h3>French Newspaper Describes Course of Negotiations on Vietnam</h3>
<p>Clermont-Ferrand: "Le Petit Parisien" recently published an article entitled "Vietnam and the Relations between France and Japan," reviewing the course of negotiations between France and Japan since June 13 this year. The article stated that former Governor-General of French Vietnam, General Catroux, accepted Japan's request on June 13 and ordered the closure of the border between Vietnam and China, and in principle agreed to conduct commercial negotiations with Japan. Not long after, Britain also followed the request of the Japanese government and closed the Yunnan-Burma Highway. After the Konoe Cabinet was formed, Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka again requested the Vietnamese authorities on August 2 to allow Japanese troops to pass through to the Chinese border. The French government immediately and formally rejected it. At the same time, because France was harmed by the idea of ​​past dangers, it was necessary to curb it and to respect pragmatism. Therefore, it expressed to Japan its willingness to conduct negotiations on the general relationship between France and Japan and was prepared to take into account Japan's special position in the Far East. This view was notified to the US government, but the US attitude was quite vague. The French-Japanese negotiations were then conducted in Tokyo by Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka and French Ambassador to Japan Henri, and a general agreement was reached immediately. The normal evolution of this agreement was nothing more than the prelude to future negotiations between the two sides in Hanoi on economic and military agreements. After that, the Vietnamese authorities and the head of the Japanese delegation, Lieutenant General Nishihara, conducted negotiations in order to establish a "faithful understanding" so as to satisfy Japan's requirements while preserving Vietnam's independence and the sovereignty that France retains over Vietnam in accordance with the French-German armistice agreement. In short, our overseas territories are still the government's most concerned matter, because all colonies trust France and share weal and woe. France must pay close attention to their integrity and prosperity. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Vichy: When the Vichy government received Japan's first request to send troops to China through Vietnam on August 2, "Le Petit Parisien" contacted the United States, but detected that the United States could not take a practical attitude, and France had formally rejected the Japanese request. However, the government did not recognize Japan's superior position in the Far East in order to deal with reality. Negotiations were conducted in order to establish an agreement that Hanoi could use as a basis for detailed discussions. At this point, Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux and Japanese representative Nishihara began talks, and to this day, the talks between the two sides continue, with mutual determination to seek understanding. On the one hand, the French side is giving Japan the satisfaction that the French government considers legitimate, and on the other hand, it will guarantee the independence of French Vietnam and the sovereignty of France.

<h3>British Newspaper Says Vietnamese Governor's Position Has Become Increasingly Difficult Recently</h3>
<p>London: The Times stated in an editorial today that although Britain has not received any news about the conclusion of an agreement between France and Japan on Vietnam, there is reason to believe that the Vichy government has accepted most of the requirements put forward by Tokyo in principle. The position of Vietnamese Governor Decoux has become increasingly difficult due to Thailand's more extensive territorial demands. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>Hanoi: Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux, on the occasion of the autumn opening of various schools, published a letter to the students of French schools, stating, "On the occasion of the start of this new school year, I would like to offer a slogan and advice to the students of primary and secondary schools throughout Vietnam. In this painful era, you must have the courage to live and think of your motherland and your parents and hometown, and think of the French motherland that is encountering great suffering. You must know that our motherland, as Marshal Pétain said, is eternal and will never perish. However, the future of the motherland depends on your efforts and will. From now on, you must pay attention to your daily work, strictly abide by discipline, be vigilant at all times, and always maintain friendship between French compatriots and Vietnamese natives. In the past, French schools have completed profound and powerful work in Vietnam, unifying the French and Vietnamese languages ​​and ideas. Therefore, all my dear students now have two responsibilities: one is to think of the motherland, trust the motherland, and obey the motherland; the other is to recognize French Vietnam, maintain Vietnam, and work hard for Vietnam."

<h3>Thailand Submits Three New Demands to Vietnamese Authorities</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Chinese sources say that Thailand has made the following new demands to Vietnam: (1) To draw a new border along the Mekong River, transferring forty small islands in the river to Thailand; (2) To cede the land southwest of the Long An River to Thailand; (3) Vietnam guarantees fair treatment of ethnic minorities in northern Vietnam. If Vietnam does not accept the above demands, Thailand will revoke the Vietnamese-Thai Treaty of Non-Aggression. Chinese sources believe that Thailand was instigated by Japan to make this request. The Ta Kung Pao warned Thailand not to follow in the footsteps of Poland, which made territorial demands when Czechoslovakia was in a difficult situation. The newspaper also said that small and weak countries must cooperate to seek their own security. (Reuter, 21st)</p>

<h3>British Forces Adopt New Tactics; German Planes Are Defeated and Retreat During Daylight Raids</h3>
<p>London: According to the British Air Ministry, the Royal Air Force used its new "double-layered pincer attack" tactic yesterday afternoon to defeat 300 to 400 German planes over London. However, at night, the German planes returned with twice the number, seemingly seeking revenge for their daytime defeat. Therefore, heavy-grade destructive bombs rained down on central London. One German plane glided down from high altitude, its engine noise ceasing. It descended to a low altitude over the city streets and quickly dropped two high-explosive bombs, which landed in the very center of London. Then, it revved its engine and escaped through the anti-aircraft fire network. During this German night raid, the entire anti-aircraft defense force in London emitted a louder roar than ever before, and the entire horizon was surrounded by an edge formed by lines of gunfire.

<h3>Gandhi Makes a Statement Before Meeting with the Viceroy of India; Says He Will Not Take Threatening Actions</h3>

<h3>British Submarine Sinks German Transport Ship; Crew Members Narrate the Experience</h3>
<p>London: An officer of the British submarine *Sturgeon* recently described the sinking of a German transport ship, saying that the submarine sailed to the Skagerrak Strait between Denmark and Norway on the morning of September 2. The wind was strong, and at dusk, the submarine's hydrophone operator faintly heard ship sounds. The submarine submerged, and after a few minutes, two small German destroyers were seen, followed by a very large transport ship. The British crew immediately prepared the torpedo tubes and fired a torpedo. In an instant, a roar was heard, and a plume of smoke was seen rising from the transport ship. The submarine then sailed away. At one point, an airplane was searching directly above the British submarine, but it did not detect the submarine. About ten minutes later, the transport ship caught fire, spreading from stem to stern, and sank half an hour later. When the submarine resurfaced, it was in the searchlight beam of the two destroyers, but the destroyers were three miles away and did not see the British submarine. It was found that the transport ship was a single-smokestack *Diesel* type ship with a weight of about 10,000 to 12,000 tons. It was torpedoed while sailing north to a port in Norway. According to Danish sources, this ship was carrying 3,000 to 4,000 soldiers, but it is not known for sure whether these men were intended to be used for the invasion of England.

<p>Roosevelt's Speech Warns the American People: If Willkie Is Elected President, Democratic Politics Will Inevitably Be Destroyed</p>
<p>Philadelphia: President Roosevelt, in a speech yesterday while accepting an honorary degree from Ben Shervani University, warned the American people that if Republican candidate Willkie is elected, he will take the management of the American government away from the people and lead American democracy to destruction. The President declared, "I dare say with regret that there are people today who want to hand over the American government to those who feel they are slightly better than ordinary citizens because of their commercial or economic abilities." Although the President did not mention Willkie by name when he made this statement, it was clearly directed at his political enemy, the Republican Party. The President continued, "The attempt by a minority of superiors to force the majority of inferiors to vote has often been seen in American history. As for me, I would rather trust the collective judgment of the directors, managers, foremen, and all the workers in a factory than the judgment of those few who have an economic interest in that factory. This is a surprisingly regressive era in the cultural history of the world. In some places, there have already been incidents of burning books, exiling scholars, and using government orders to forcibly determine religion, morality, and cultural forms. In this kind of era, we should not be satisfied with merely formal celebrations for the bicentennial of this free and independent institution of higher learning. Today, I am deeply honored to be awarded an honorary degree by Ben Shervani University. The establishment of this university was for many who do not have sufficient material resources to enjoy higher education, to be able to study religion and learning. The founders of this school have made it an educational source for poor children to avoid dropping out of school. In the past two hundred years, the existence and evolution of this school has been a permanent and powerful symbol of the concept of freedom of thought and action in America." The President then listed the political ideas of Hemel and Jefferson, pointing out that the latter advocated for public management of politics, and said that if a country's vote, whether we are highly educated or own property, can freely exercise its right to vote, then this country will never be in danger of falling into the hands of a tyrant. He continued, "In terms of elections, I would rather believe in the collective judgment of the directors, managers, and workers in one or two factories than the judgment of the few who have an interest in the factory, and the collective judgment of landlords, farmers, and agricultural workers is more well-founded than the individual judgment of the landlord alone. If free elections exist, no one part of the population can permanently control our country's government. The safety of the American government lies in whether free elections can be maintained. In history, no dictator can exist in an environment of truly free elections. This basic truth is common sense for the American people, but to understand the experiences of other countries, this principle should be kept firmly in mind. Don't lose the fist. Ten years ago, the German people lost their democratic system based on free elections, so Nazism was able to seize the opportunity. After the Nazi Party seized power, the new German regime eliminated all rights to free elections and free election of government leaders, so since 1933, the German people have had no such rights. Under a democratic system, human beings should abandon pride and prejudice in thought and action, and seek and guide the truth sufficient to maintain human freedom with courage, sincerity, and humility."

<p>European War Talks (10) (1) A Perspective on the Pétain Government</p>
<p>The inside story of France's capitulation has already been translated and published in this newspaper. But what kind of organization is the Pétain government? Now, we will translate and record the dissection made by reporters from the New York Herald Tribune and the Manchester Guardian to serve as an answer:</p>
<p>The Pétain government is often referred to by the world as a "dictatorial" government, accusing the French people of betraying democracy, abandoning their allies, and calling Pétain a puppet in the hands of the conservative Laval. While these accusations are not entirely without reason, they mostly seem to be caused by a lack of understanding of the enormous spiritual and material disasters suffered by France.</p>
<p>The reporter once spent the last days of free life with the French people, which were also days of great suffering. He deeply knows that the French people are very clear that they are not only losing their independence but also have the possibility of national demise. In the previous Great War, France lost 1.5 million people, and the impact of this huge loss is still being felt today. Twenty years later, another war broke out, and the French nation was already discouraged.</p>
<p>Pétain initially organized the government in Bordeaux and called for an armistice. At that time, he may have been a puppet, but France did need Pétain because he was not a "politician" but a great figure in the military. He deeply knew that the nation's strength could not continue to fight. General Weygand also supported Pétain. Even the general French public mostly did not advocate continuing the war in Britain or in French colonies.</p>
<p>When the reporter discussed the issue of war and peace with people in the French government in Bordeaux, many of them said that the French navy and the French garrison officers and soldiers in North Africa and Syria would probably not enthusiastically fight against Germany because they were concerned about their families still in the occupied areas. Based on the reporter's conversations with fellow French sailors on the way from Tours to Rochefort, he deeply knew that this statement was not false.</p>
<p>Most of these sailors came from the provinces of Brittany and Provence. If the war continued, these two provinces would inevitably be bombarded. The unstable elements in the French fleet must also understand that there were many dangers in the fleet retreating into foreign military ports.</p>
<p>When the armistice agreement was signed, the French army had actually disintegrated, and the air force had also been largely damaged. Pétain and Weygand were clearly concerned about maintaining France's future unity and believed that the French nation could not withstand further losses.</p>
<p>The new French government must now lead the defeated country through major difficulties and humiliations. The French public all believed that the slowness of the parliamentary system and the disputes between parties were the main reasons for France's defeat. Therefore, after the armistice, it was not surprising that the French authorities reorganized a semi-dictatorial government.</p>
<p>Mayor Henry of Versailles was appointed by the Pétain government as the ambassador to the United States. Before departing for the United States to take office, he gave a speech at a banquet for American expatriates in Paris. He was the first French official to give a public speech in Paris after its fall.</p>
<p>Mr. Henry said briefly, "I am qualified to speak on behalf of the government, but I do not have the right to speak freely. My words and actions must be cautious. The position of the French ambassador to the United States has never been as difficult as mine, and my mission will also be difficult. France has suffered the most tragic defeat in its history. France fought not because it was attacked but because it wanted to act in concert with other countries. Today, France has suffered great sacrifices, losing hundreds of thousands of sons, but France does not believe that its spirit will perish from this."</p>
<p>Today, those who conquer France also know that the French spirit will never diminish and will continue to exist to resist all obstacles and hardships. As long as the spirit does not die, the French nation can look forward to a better future. Although everything is extremely difficult at present, the world can believe that the French nation will be able to revive.</p>
<p>Below is a report from the former Paris correspondent of the Manchester Guardian:</p>
<p>There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding in the outside world about the true nature of the Pétain government. It is also a misunderstanding to regard it as a "right-wing fascist government." It is true that the Pétain government has various pro-fascist tendencies and anti-British sentiments caused by recent events in France, but the Pétain government also represents the special concept that France has had in recent years, which is fatalism. Those who hold this view believe that France is an old country that cannot resist the more powerful autocratic countries, so it is better to adapt to the situation that will dominate Europe for the next few hundred years as soon as possible.</p>
<p>According to those around General Pétain, the top priority is to maintain the life of the French nation, even if it means enduring humiliation for a long time. They are never willing to risk the destruction of the French nation. Some French people underestimate the viciousness of the German methods and often say to reporters, "Even if Britain can be destroyed, France is a country that cannot be destroyed."</p>
<p>General Pétain's idea of France as an old country coincides with the idea of "seeking revival from humiliation" held by some French people. This idea is most strongly advocated by new socialists such as Mayor Marg of Bordeaux.</p>
<p>Thierre believed that France would inevitably be defeated. After the French army's line on the Meuse River was broken, Thierre expressed his opinion in the lounge of the Chamber of Deputies, saying, "The location for seeking peace should be on the Seine River rather than the Somme River, on the Loire River rather than the Seine River, and on the Garonne River rather than the Loire River." His meaning was that it was better to seek peace as soon as possible, and those who supported the Munich Agreement now argued forcefully, saying, "Everything we did in the past was to save France from the predicted disastrous defeat."</p>
<p>It was not only right-wing people who supported the Munich Agreement and held the view that defeat was inevitable. Among all parties, such as the Radical Party members Ponle and Xu Dan, and the Socialist Party members Fourier and Folais, all had a strong sense of inevitable defeat. These left-wing pro-peace members all had representatives in the Pétain government, so it is a mistake to call the Pétain government a "right-wing government." The Pétain government actually contained all those who deeply believed that France would be defeated.</p>
<p>France will not perish. No matter how many years of suffering it endures, it must seek self-help from combat. This belief has long been deeply rooted in the hearts of the French people. When the reporter returned home from Bordeaux on a ship, he saw many French refugees on the ship in conflict with each other. This scene was lamentable. As a result of the conflict, a large number of French refugees decided to leave the ship and return to Bordeaux, regardless of the dangers ahead. This shows the French people's attachment to their homeland and their determination to stay in their country no matter what kind of tragedy they encounter.</p>
<p>Even though their homeland has been ravaged by invaders and betrayed by politicians, its people still feel reluctant to leave. This is a typical French national characteristic. The reason why there is no danger of political figures in the country being assassinated and few people flee overseas is also because of this. Although the French people fled from Paris to Tours and Bordeaux, they were unwilling to avoid other places. Regardless of whether the future is good or bad, they are willing to stay in the country and prepare to passively resist the invaders.</p>
<p>Italy's armistice conditions with France seem to be more moderate on the surface than expected, and they do not stipulate that Italian troops will occupy a large amount of French mainland territory. The intention of this is undoubtedly to lure pro-Italian elements in the Pétain government to realize the illusion of Franco-Italian cooperation against Britain.

<p>Australian Federal Election: Prime Minister Advises All Parties to Abandon Selfishness and Ambition</p>
<p>Sydney: The Australian federal election is being held today. The number of candidates being put forward is unprecedented. The leaders have all issued statements focusing on dealing with the war situation. Australian Prime Minister Menzies and Labor leader Curtin both urgently want a majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Although Curtin also advocates helping Britain, he believes that Australia's defense is more important than sending troops overseas. The House of Representatives should fill 75 seats in this election, and there are as many as 273 candidates competing. There are also 65 candidates competing for 19 Senate seats. Menzies said on the radio last night that no matter which party is in power after the election, it should receive public support. The danger ahead is too great. All parties should abandon selfishness and ambition to serve the future of the world and should not weaken their strength due to internal divisions. (Reuters, 21st)</p>

<p>Finance: Forward US Dollar Unusually Tight</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listing remained unchanged. The trend of the British-US exchange rate in the black market was mediocre in the first half of the day. It opened slightly stronger in the morning, but soon after speculators piled in, it returned to flat. Later, trading was sluggish and the situation was dull. Until noon, a foreign bank took advantage of Da Tong to suddenly increase its buying interest in forward US dollars, so forward rates became unusually tight. As a result, spot rates were flat overall, and forward rates were flat for the British pound and soft for the US dollar at 0.03125. No market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Importers Piled in to Settle</p>
<p>In the early morning, both near and far London large bars were flat, New York silver prices were unchanged, and London raw gold was stable. Exchange rates were flat for both British pound to US dollar and British pound to Shanghai currency, and there were no increases or decreases for either US dollar to British pound or US dollar to Shanghai currency. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same as before. Banks opened with spot selling prices of 3 3/8 pence for the British pound and 5.28125 yuan for the US dollar, which was 0.015625 higher for the British pound and 0.03125 higher for the US dollar compared to the previous close. However, speculators and import trading houses piled in slightly, and the market quickly returned to flat. It was reported that US dollars for this month were sold for 5.25 yuan, and interbank trading of US dollars for October was also at 5.25 yuan. At that time, the spot US dollar could only be settled at 5.25 yuan, and the shilling also weakened to 3 3/8 pence and 484375. HSBC's listing was announced as unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was also announced as flat. After that, the market was very quiet, and trading was extremely sluggish. Until 11:30 am, a foreign bank took advantage of Da Tong to suck in September US dollars at 5.25 yuan, and the market situation remained flat. By the close, the British pound was at 3 3/8 pence and 484375, the US dollar was at 5.25 yuan, the British pound for October was at 3 3/8 pence and 46875, and the US dollar was at 5.21875 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous day, the British pound spot rate was flat, the US dollar spot rate was flat, and the October rate was slightly tighter at 0.03125. No market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Market Had No Ups or Downs Yesterday</p>
<p>Hong Kong, September 21st: The exchange market opened flat this morning, with no ups or downs in any exchange rate. (Note: Yesterday, the Shanghai exchange spot rate rose to 428 yuan). At 11:30 am, it was reported as flat, and there were still no changes in any exchange rates. No market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Tianjin US Dollar Also Tight</p>
<p>Tianjin, September 11th: The exchange market opened with fluctuations this morning. Spot rates for the British pound, Shanghai exchange, and "joint banknotes" in the black market had no ups or downs. The spot rate for the US dollar was unusually tight at 0.0625, at 5.03125 yuan.</p>
<p>Wealthy Merchants Absorbing Gold Again</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai cash raw gold black market tended to stabilize. Although the price once rose to over 6,300 yuan under the absorption by wealthy merchants in the city, the rumor that the Japanese side softened in the midst of chaotic news from Vietnam and withdrew the Edemson book of mourning still made most people feel optimistic. It opened in the morning and rose to 6,290 yuan under the absorption of wealthy merchants. Gold shops and small money changers sold vigorously, and it was seen to fall back. However, with the foreign exchange tightening, silver shops helped to push up strongly, and it flew up to 6,305 yuan. The rumor was beneficial to sellers, and securities firms suddenly came to sell, and a return wind was immediately seen. It retreated to 6,250 yuan, and finally rose again to 6,280 yuan at the close due to the soft forward US dollar and people's optimism. It轧rose another 15 yuan. It was found that more than 3,000 taels were traded in the first half of the day. In the afternoon, there was no market for Saturday delivery, and the price rose again to around 6,300 yuan. Decorative gold, customs gold, etc. were all flat.</p>
<p>Raw Gold Good for 15 Yuan</p>
<p>Although the exchange market was reported to be strong in the early morning, it weakened shortly afterwards, so people remained firm. In addition, a certain silver building, entrusted by wealthy merchants, came to search for purchases first, and the market opened up 25 yuan. A certain silver building entered more than 100 taels from gold shops and silver shops, all at 6,290 yuan. Although a certain silver building still came to grab purchases, the selling pressure on the desk was strong for a while, and gold shops and scattered households scrambled to sell. It soon fell back to 6,265 yuan. After that, the number of sellers decreased sharply, and the price recovered upward. Relying on another gold shop and silver shop to help pull up, it rose to 6,305 yuan. Then there were many high-priced sellers, and the market situation changed suddenly. Silver shops and gold shops spit out, and it fell more than 20 yuan. Suddenly, it was rumored that the Japanese side's attitude towards Vietnam had softened, and there was a saying that Edemson's book of mourning had been withdrawn. The number of sellers increased, and the silver shop helped to sell even more vigorously. It once reached a low of 6,250 yuan. After 11:00, the market situation stabilized, and the price fluctuated upward again. It was also heard that the American bank had a strong appetite for the US dollar at this time. Securities firms suddenly turned from outflow to inflow, and another silver shop took advantage of the momentum to increase its bets. Before the close, it reached 6,290 yuan again, but the close was 6,280 yuan, 轧rising 15 yuan compared to yesterday. The potential was still strong after the close, and someone was buying at 6,290 yuan. The difference in the first half of the day was 55 yuan. The selling price of cash shops' own-brand gold was more than ten yuan higher than raw gold, and the purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and there was little trading.</p>
<p>Decorative Gold Still Unchanged</p>
<p>The exchange price of jewelry gold per tael in silver shops is still unchanged. Da Tong Hang still hangs at 640 yuan, and Xin Tong Hang is similar to the previous price, reducing the purchase price by about 30 yuan.</p>
<p>Financial Commentary by Sheng Kaiqiong</p>
<p>——September 21st——</p>
<p>The Foundation of the National Currency</p>
<p>Because of the recent issuance of various new banknotes in Chongqing, speculators in the Shanghai market have unintentionally fallen victim to some kind of malicious propaganda and false reporting, and have begun to act again, thinking that the Chinese government will truly embark on the path of inflation. This is truly a case of fools worrying about themselves! It should be known that Chongqing is under heavy bombing by the Japanese, and government agencies have moved to the countryside, and people have also left Chongqing due to evacuation. As a result, banks have had large amounts of banknotes withdrawn by agencies and people. Therefore, since the end of August, banks in Chongqing have restricted the withdrawal of banknotes, limiting each person to 1,000 yuan per day, with the remainder given in bank checks, until September 9, when banks no longer restricted the withdrawal of banknotes. Such a large amount of banknotes flowed out from the bank's vault to various places, and naturally could not return to the bank's vault for a while. In order to cope with daily payments, the bank had to strengthen its inventory. It is the important task of the government bank to regulate finance. Since the market in Chongqing deeply felt the lack of banknotes, it was only right to transport banknotes to help. Given the complexity of the types of banknotes issued by Chinese government banks and the divergence of versions, it is impossible for all types and versions of banknotes to circulate in the market. If banknotes that have not been seen locally in the past are rashly used, people will naturally pay attention to them because they have never seen them before. This is nothing to be surprised about. It is also a routine procedure for banks to make a public announcement before issuing them. However, speculators used this as an opportunity to engage in malicious propaganda and speculation, disregarding the interests of the country and the nation, and only seeking to profit from troubled waters. As a result, they were unknowingly used by others, and they themselves suffered losses if the national currency was affected by the worries of fools.</p>
<p>Therefore, Shanghai, as well as every Chinese citizen throughout China, should trust the national currency and support the national currency. It should be known that although China's national currency system was established before the war, its prosperity and growth were fully established during the war, laying the foundation for its indestructible resilience. It is not only the only successful currency in Chinese monetary history, but also the only currency that China has now and will have in the future. Moreover, it is the only sound currency in this turbulent world where the value of currencies in various countries is unstable. It is China's only lifeline for resisting Japan and building the country during the war, and for stabilizing finance and promoting industry and commerce after the war. The Chinese government will never abandon the foundation it has laid and maintained with great difficulty over the past three years and embark on the opposite path of destruction and devastation of inflation at this turning point when the war of resistance is entering its fourth year and victory is approaching.</p>
<p>The increase in the amount of national currency issued is undoubtedly undeniable, but given the past chaos in China's monetary situation, the fact that the national currency system had not been implemented in vast and remote provinces before the war, and the huge amount of funds required for economic construction in free China during the war, it can be seen that the increase in issuance is entirely due to objective economic needs, not subjective fiscal needs. The increase in issuance should not be regarded as inflation. (For more on this point, please refer to the Financial Commentary of July 21, "Review of the Amount of National Currency Issued.") The Chinese government has been striving to avoid inflation from the beginning. At the beginning of the war, it promoted the remittance system, using remittance bills to control the circulation of currency. It successively promulgated various regulations on saving the country through thrift and national construction, and measures for fixed-term savings deposits in foreign currencies, as well as temporary measures for managing banks during extraordinary times, in order to encourage savings and absorb funds, and implement contraction of currency and control of issuance. Therefore, in the three years of the war of resistance, the issuance of national currency has increased from 1.4 billion to 3.9 billion, an increase of less than two times, while still maintaining 48.4% of gold and silver and foreign exchange reserves valued at 191.7 million yuan. Compared with the issuance of 1,867,788,000 yuan increased to 4,211,700,000 yuan by the three banks of Japan, Taiwan, and Korea, with only 12% of gold and silver reserves valued at 509,445,000 yuan, the strength of its foundation is self-evident. It is hoped that speculators in Shanghai will not fall victim to malicious propaganda and false reports, and should remain calm, trust the national currency, and support the national currency!</p>
<p>Setting Commercial Exchange Rates for Hong Kong</p>
<p>After the national currency commercial exchange rate was changed to 4 1/2 pence against the British pound from August 1, other exchange rates were calculated based on its market exchange rate with the British pound and the newly set 4 1/2 pence. At that time, the author estimated that it would be 7.5375 against the US dollar and 3.34 yuan against the Hong Kong dollar, but since then there have been no reports on the exchange rates against the US dollar and the Hong Kong dollar. Yesterday, a Chongqing telegram said that the commercial exchange rate against the Hong Kong dollar has been set at 3.33 yuan. This market price differs from the author's estimate by one cent, and the calculation is based on 4 1/2 pence and 1 shilling and 3 32/1 pence, while the government's determination this time is based on 1 shilling and 3 pence.</p>
<p>Now that the exchange rate against the Hong Kong dollar has been set, what we are currently waiting for is what the exchange rate against the US dollar will be. However, if the British pound is freely exchanged for US dollars under British control, the commercial exchange rate against the US dollar can be calculated according to the statutory pound price, which is still around 7.5 yuan. Conversely, it will be calculated according to the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar to the US dollar or the free pound price in Shanghai, and the market price will be 100 yuan of national currency equal to about 6.75 yuan of US dollars.</p>
<p>In passing, I would like to mention that there was a rumor in the Shanghai market a while ago that the commercial exchange rate would be changed from 4 1/2 pence to 3 pence. At that time, the author denounced it as nonsense. Now that the exchange rate against the Hong Kong dollar is set at 3.33 yuan based on 4 1/2 pence, speculators who want to use this rumor to operate in the foreign exchange market should be utterly disappointed!</p>
<p>Counterfeit Chinese Banknotes with No Place Name in the 24th Year of the Republic by Yun</p>
<p>The identification of genuine and counterfeit banknotes of the Bank of China has been seen in this newspaper for the past two days. It was said that there were counterfeit banknotes of the Bank of China with the Shanghai place name in the 24th year of the Republic, and there were no counterfeit banknotes without the place name. However, counterfeit banknotes are emerging endlessly, and counterfeit banknotes without the place name in the 24th year of the Republic have recently been discovered. The printing is exquisite. Not only are the concave and convex patterns clearly distinguishable, but there is also no difference in color between the front and back. The patterns around the front, the four characters of the bank name, and the image of the Founding Father are all similar to the genuine ones. However, the white mesh pattern in the black center around the five yuan number in the middle is thicker than that of the genuine banknotes. The trees and clouds on the mountains in the scenery of Beihai Park on the right and the bridge scene are not as clear as the genuine banknotes. The printing on the back is slightly worse, such as the lines of the bank's new building scenery, which are not as obvious as the genuine banknotes. The five characters of Ali Bo in the four corners and the heart-shaped patterns are crude. The yellow mesh pattern on both sides under the English bank name is earthy yellow for the genuine banknotes and light yellow for the counterfeit banknotes.</p>
<p>However, for this kind of counterfeit banknote, for example, a bank receives more than 100,000 banknotes every day, and they are mixed in the middle. The cashier and the customer who checks the banknotes all seek to be quick, and it is over in an instant. Careful inspection is not allowed by the facts. Moreover, most of the bank's business counters operate under lights, and it is inevitable to receive counterfeit banknotes by mistake. According to bank regulations, the shortage of counterfeit banknotes must be borne by the cashier, so it is not easy to be a bank teller.</p>
<p>Foreign Currencies Continue to Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: Raw gold fluctuated slightly and rose. The British and American gold pounds also rose slightly by five jiao. The latter also knocked on the 150 yuan mark. The demand for British gold bills continued, and the price rose by 7.5 jiao. The American gold bill finally rose by five fen. The demand for Hong Kong bills was increasingly strong, and the market price continued to rise by four fen. The Japanese gold bill continued to rise, reaching a high of 1.52 yuan in the evening market. The supply and demand for Korean bills was uniform, and the market price remained stable. The evening market was still 1.18 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Market Tends to Hover</p>
<p>The soybean market once suffered from the impact of sluggish sales and fell. Although export sales started to move in the past two days, people's hearts were scattered and the development was mediocre. Although the source of new beans is not surging at the moment, they are arriving one after another, so the strength of the buying is not strong, and it is difficult for the overall situation to escape the hovering situation. Yesterday, Hong Kong gangs and local merchants took in 89 packages of Jiading soybeans at a price of 35 yuan to 35.5 yuan. Hengqiao beans were priced at 36.5 yuan per 100 packages. More than 200 packages of Taicang beans were priced at 35.05 yuan. 100 packages of Liuhe beans were priced at 34.7 yuan. 150 packages of Anqing beans were priced at 32.6 yuan. 80 packages of Changzhou cowhide yellow beans were priced at 33 yuan. Since Japanese merchants searched for small horse feed beans, the broad bean market once became active. However, the unfavorable import exchange rate made the buying weak. Others were also not greedy for buying, so it was difficult for the market sentiment to rise. The supply and demand of sesame were equal. Due to the lack of large households doing business, the market situation was relaxed.</p>
<p>In addition, 500 packages of raw peanuts and 1,325 cans of raw oil were shipped from Yantai to Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<p>In addition, today there are 3,860 packages of beans, 985 bean cakes, and 300 cans of raw oil. There are also 100 pieces of tea leaves, all shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Securities: Domestic Debt Sees a Resurgence of Upsurge</p>
<p>Yesterday's securities black market suddenly saw a resurgence of upsurge, and people's hearts were extremely firm. Since September 10, the small decline has continued for six or seven days. Since 56.95 yuan, Class C has broken through 6 yuan, 5 yuan, 4 yuan, and 3 yuan. It has fallen by more than 3 yuan. On the one hand, bulls have emerged, and on the other hand, shorts have increased their bets. The number of floating loans delivered was very large. After accumulating for a long time, there was a depletion of chips, and the market began to抵補floating shorts. Class C has broken through the 5 yuan mark, and trading in the market has suddenly become lively, with a tendency to rebound again. From the perspective of supply and demand, large households are absorbing again, and there is demand again on the 16th. Buying started first, followed by Xinfu, Hengfu, Jiufu, and Xie Da, etc., buying at market prices. Although Lianyi, Jiufeng, Shengchang, and Yongkang, etc., continued to supply, the market still felt that demand exceeded supply. The morning rose by half a yuan. In the afternoon, Shengda's buying appetite was extremely strong, buying more than 200,000 yuan. Jiufeng turned from selling to buying, and Hengfu continued to buy. Hongda also bought a lot. Lianyi continued to sell. Xie Da had some spitting out. Datong, Yichang, and Lianhe had some supply. Scattered households had more outflow than inflow. In the afternoon, it rose by another 3 to 4 jiao. As a result, it unanimously rebounded by 3.5 to 9 jiao. The total turnover was about 1.1 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Food: Foreign Rice Rises Again, Domestic Rice Sources Are Controlled Again, New Japonica Rice Arrivals Are Still Not Weak</p>
<p>After the consecutive flatness of foreign rice, the market seemed to be moving towards a smooth road. However, yesterday, the cargo side borrowed the Vietnam issue to stir up people's hearts and pull up market prices. The market was already thriving in the morning and was not affected by the surge in domestic and foreign rice arrivals. Shantou gangs and floating households added to the buying, and the market became even tighter. Prices immediately increased by 6 to 7 jiao to nearly a yuan. No. 1 Saigon was at 68.2 yuan, No. 2 was at 63.2 yuan, fire-milled was at 67 yuan, and small-milled was at 62.2 yuan. Yinghua Si's original package No. 2 Siamese opened with dozens of tons in the early morning, priced at 70 yuan, with insurance and other fees excluded. However, the cargo side also rallied and shouted higher after the middle of the market, so the deal was not completed. It is said that the number of foreign rice transactions is calculated based on the two-way customer hoarding, totaling about 7,000 packages.</p>
<p>Although there were no glutinous rice arrivals, the inventory was still abundant, but the sales path was sluggish, so the market fell by another 5 to 6 jiao. Kaijin Litte was at 69 yuan to 67 yuan, Changdan was at 67.5 yuan, and Hong Kong Special was at 68 yuan to 67 yuan.</p>
<p>The sources of thick, thin, and broken japonica and other domestic rice were blocked. Seeing that the foreign rice market was strong, the actual sales were slightly active. The black market prices continued to be set, with Changbang white japonica opening at 78 yuan, ordinary at 70.7 yuan, Wuchang Su Kun japonica high at 77.5 yuan, and second at 73.4 yuan. Bai Mao Kou secondary japonica was at 73.2 yuan to 72 yuan. Qingpu thin broken middle was at 76 yuan. Nanhang early broken was mostly transported by merchants and arrived daily. The original package opened well at 75 yuan, middle at 74 yuan, and rough at 71.5 yuan to 71 yuan.</p>
<p>The sources of new japonica pointed tips from various routes totaled about 2,000 dan by land and 7 to 800 dan by water, but most of them were directly purchased by rice shops, so the market transaction was flat and the market was stable. Dongxin opened at 71 yuan to 69 yuan, and Xixin at 73.5 yuan to 70 yuan. The rough price of Taicang Jiading sheep tip was 59 yuan, and the Du tip was 60.5 yuan to 60 yuan.</p>
<p>North Gang Actively Buys Local Powder, Customer Prices Are Almost Equal to Foreign Powder</p>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's flour market remained firm. Although the disk of the No. 2 flour mill was still at the original price of 16 yuan, the most that buyers wanted to purchase was only a few dozen or 1 to 200 bags. Therefore, the spot goods of Fuxin and Lao Che powder became increasingly scarce, and the</p>

<p>Weekly Supplement The "Heart" of England</p>
<p>The "heart" of England, the Midlands, covers 21,000 square miles. It extends east from the North Sea, south to Birmingham, west to the Irish Sea, and north to Stockton. This square region truly contains the lifeblood of England.</p>
<p>In terms of military importance, this area is similar to Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New England in the United States. Pennsylvania and New Jersey are the centers for steel mills, coal mines, and munitions factories, while copper mines, machine factories, and aircraft factories are concentrated in New England. These three states occupy a very important position in the national defense industry of the United States. If the factories, railways, and highways in these areas were subjected to continuous bombing or occupied by enemy forces, the fighting power of the United States would be greatly affected.</p>
<p>Over the past two centuries, the "heart" of England has been propelled by the Industrial Revolution to become the world's greatest industrial region. Its resources and manpower have broadcast the might of Britain to a quarter of the Earth's surface, allowing Britain to dominate world commerce for the past 125 years. The British invested the surplus funds from the development of India in this industrial region, collected wool from Scotland, cotton from the United States and Egypt, and coal and iron from Britain, Switzerland, and Spain, transforming raw materials into goods to be sold around the world.</p>
<p>Since India, Japan, and the United States have independently developed their textile industries, the textile industry in this region of England has suffered some losses. However, the production of valuable goods is increasing, making it the largest producer of various military weapons and daily-use metal utensils. For example, Sheffield produces knives, swords, precision instruments, cannons, metal steel plates, munitions, and ship machinery; Birmingham produces train locomotives, buttons, wedding rings, machine guns, copper bed frames, safety pins, tires, and automobiles; the six cities between Stockton and Trent produce various ceramic utensils; and the shipyards in Barrow-in-Furness, Birkenhead, and Liverpool can manufacture various ship hulls.</p>
<p>Along the eastern coastal plains, various foods needed by the British are produced. The coastal ports are extremely rich in fishery and salt resources. Hitler, understanding that this heartland of England was the driving force behind British international trade, sought to completely destroy this region after the outbreak of the war. In reality, it was there that the British fleet was built to protect the British Empire.</p>
<p>Various industries in the area have developed along both sides of the Pennine Mountains. Between Manchester and Leeds, it is divided by a mountain gorge. In the early 19th century, the British excavated a canal through this gorge. (See "British Civilian Life Before the War" in this newspaper's "European War Talks".) This canal connects the Mersey, Aire, and Humber rivers, which is extremely beneficial for shipping. The underground coal and iron reserves on both sides of the Pennine Mountains are extremely abundant. The industrial centers of Leeds, Sheffield, Nottingham, Derby, Birmingham, and Manchester are all located along these mountains. These cities, with their towering chimneys, are shrouded in coal smoke day and night, and the furnaces burn fiercely, giving them the reputation of being the "Black Country." Living in such a harsh and uninteresting environment, it is no wonder that the people there are exceptionally stubborn in nature. The major cities are connected by highways and railways, making transportation extremely convenient.</p>
<p>Since June, Hitler has made this area the largest target for bombing England. When German bombers fly overhead, they can always find industrial targets worthy of being destroyed by bombs. The transportation network of railways, waterways, and the Thames River is used to transport munitions very frequently. If the bombs hit the key points accurately, it would have a significant impact on the supply of military equipment.</p>
<p>Apart from the London area, this region is also the main base for the British aviation industry. Leeds is the birthplace of naval dive bombers and fighter planes. A company called Fairey Aviation in Stockport, Lancashire, can manufacture a type of aerial torpedo. A factory in Christchurch on the River Avon specializes in the production of Vickers long-range heavy bombers. The Wellesley and Wellington aircraft are produced in this area. Avro Anson aircraft, used for coastal patrol, are manufactured in Manchester and Yeadon. The famous Rolls-Royce engines are produced in Derby.</p>
<p>The ports of Liverpool and Hull, one connected to the Irish Sea and the other to the Humber River on the North Sea, are the heartland of American waterways. The Germans are most focused on destroying transportation in these two places. The railway junctions in Crewe, Derby, Peterborough, Spalding, Stamford, Shrewsbury, and Christchurch are most vulnerable to bombing damage. Great Grimsby on the Humber River, normally a fishing port, has been transformed into a concentration camp for torpedo boats and a location for huge oil depots during wartime. There is also a radio station nearby that connects to Australia. Leeds is the largest industrial area for meat and leather in England. The British Northern Command Headquarters is located in York.</p>
<p>The water along the southern coast of the East Sea is relatively shallow, making it difficult for large ships to navigate or dock in many places, but this phenomenon is not universal. In the far north, the coast north of Bridlington has natural fortifications of cliffs and precipices, with green rocks that often reach over 600 feet in height. However, south of the Humber River, the rocks are gray-yellow and lower in height, and the beaches are generally 10 to 20 yards wide.</p>
<p>Mines have long been buried in the Humber River, and it also has a Danish-style naval defense route weathered by wind and frost. The low, flat shoals of the Wash estuary, several miles long, are not very suitable for naval landings due to their shallowness. South of the Wash in the Fens—everything is very much like the Netherlands: tall, blond residents, windmills in the sky, and cyclamen everywhere—the entire area is filled with dikes. The broad area close to the coast is interwoven with ditches and is very solid and flat, all the way to the East Anglian hills.</p>
<p>The British air defense there is also quite dense. The number of air force and civilian aviation airfields is not small, allowing them to advance to attack or retreat to defend. The deployment of anti-aircraft guns in the densely populated towns is also not weak. In addition, along both sides of the Pennine Mountains, the slopes are steep, making it very difficult for enemy aircraft to land there. The top of the Pennine Mountains is sparsely populated, a wilderness. Apart from some grassland, the rest is overgrown with weeds and cannot support life. However, paratroopers can find a few flat areas to land and places to hide, and then descend from the mountains to disrupt transportation between the villages. The British discovered the difficulty of guarding this desolate wilderness in the early summer of this year, because the only passable routes are narrow paths, and the only protection is gray stone walls.</p>
<h3>Bertrand Russell's Essay on Academic Freedom (Continued)</h3>
<p>Organized, politicized education is a major danger of our time. Appearing in the form of nationalism, it provokes international wars; appearing in other forms, it provokes civil wars. The teacher's mission is to stand apart from partisan strife, striving to instill in young people the habit of impartial research, judging the merits of issues, and preventing them from accepting one-sided theories. Teachers should neither flatter the prejudices of the crowd nor cater to the secrets of officials. Their professional ethics should be fair to all parties, stepping outside of right and wrong, purely as objective scientific research. They should not hesitate to cause public anger with the results of their research.</p>
<p>However, the teacher's mission is not only to invisibly resolve the intense disputes of the present. They also have positive missions to fulfill, and one cannot become a great teacher of the age without the desire to fulfill these missions. Therefore, teachers bear a greater responsibility than other classes for the preservation of civilization. They should also deeply understand what civilization is and cultivate a civilized attitude in their students. What, then, is a civilized society?</p>
<p>The common answer to this question largely uses material achievements as the standard. For example, a country with many machines, many automobiles, many bathrooms, and fast transportation is considered a civilized country. However, in my opinion, most modern people overemphasize these things. Civilization, in its more important sense, is a matter of the spirit, not a material matter of physical enjoyment. Therefore, knowledge occupies a part, and emotions also occupy a part. In terms of knowledge, a person should understand their own relationship to the world in time and space, as well as the relationship of their environment to the world. They should view their country not only as the land where they live but also as one of many countries in the world, all with equal rights to survive, think, and feel.</p>
<p>In terms of emotions, if a person is truly enlightened, they also need to expand their scope, extending themselves to others. From birth to death, humans are sometimes happy, sometimes unfortunate, sometimes generous, sometimes greedy, and always calculating; sometimes heroic, sometimes cowardly and humble. In their lifetime, there are certain things that stand out and are worth valuing. Some people are inspired by their impulse to love humanity, some help us understand the world in which we live through their superhuman intelligence, and some produce art through their special sensitivity. These people produce "good" that benefits humanity, far beyond the brutality, oppression, and superstition of long historical periods. Within their power, they make human life more like that of civilized people than during the times when barbarians roamed. A civilized person, for some occasions, cannot express approval, then they should first understand the truth instead of simply denouncing. In other words, they should find the root of evil and seek ways to eradicate it, not just hate the people who have fallen into sin. All of this is the intellectual and emotional understanding that a teacher should have. Only with this understanding can they instill this mission in the young people they teach.</p>
<p>A person cannot be a good teacher unless they have enthusiasm for their students and a desire to instill valuable knowledge in them. However, this attitude is different from that of a propagandist. A propagandist does not want their disciples to examine the state of the world and freely choose valuable goals. The propagandist is like a gardening expert who wants to train students to bend when they should bend and stand straight when they should stand straight, just like a gardener cultivating bonsai. In order to hinder the natural development of their disciples, they do not hesitate to destroy their noble spirit, giving them jealousy, destructiveness, and brutality. Humanity does not need brutality; I believe that most brutality is the result of improper early education, or rather, being misled down the wrong path.</p>
<p>The fanaticism of oppression and abuse is extremely common, and examples of it abound throughout the world today. But this is not an indispensable part of human nature. On the contrary, I believe it stems from some misfortune. It is also the teacher's mission to broaden the student's horizons, pointing out to them that there are other actions that are welcomed by the masses and are beneficial to people. Therefore, they should allow their good instincts to fully develop and prevent the growth of the desire to deprive others of happiness. Some people criticize the purpose of happiness as being for oneself and for others. Giving up personal happiness for public purposes is one thing, and viewing the happiness of the masses as unimportant is another. But the latter's actions are often carried out in the name of false heroism. Those who adopt this attitude generally have a brutal undertone, and the cause of this action may be due to unconscious jealousy, which often originates in childhood or adolescence. The purpose of the educator is to train adults to get rid of this psychological misfortune and cultivate a psychology that is unwilling to harm the happiness of others.</p>
<p>As shown by current facts, many teachers cannot fully fulfill the responsibilities they are capable of. There are many reasons for this, some of which are relatively accidental, and some of which are deeply rooted in tradition. Most teachers teach too much, and as a result, they consider it finished when they have trained students to complete exams, and they are unwilling to give students free psychological training. People who do not teach do not know the energy that teaching takes. Pastors do not need to preach for several hours every day, but teachers have to work for several hours every day, and as a result, most teachers suffer greatly and become overly sensitive. They cannot study the latest published teaching materials they are teaching, nor can they encourage their students to develop interest in gaining new ideas and new knowledge.</p>
<p>But this is not the most serious problem. In many countries, certain opinions are considered correct, and others are considered dangerous. Teachers who are considered to have incorrect opinions are therefore hoped by the state to remain silent about those opinions. If they mention their opinions, that is "propaganda," and only mentioning opinions that the state considers correct is considered proper teaching. As a result, studious and thoughtful young people often cannot correctly recognize the outstanding ideas of the time after leaving the classroom. Rather, in the subject of civics, the purpose of teaching is more to lead people into a fog. The political knowledge imparted to young people is the self-evident platitudes of politics, while all the realities of actual politics are deliberately concealed. When young people grow up and discover the true inside story, it is very easy to create a cynical phenomenon, and all social ideals are lost. If they were initially taught the truth and given appropriate explanations, they might be able to become energetic and dare to challenge all evils, instead of just shrugging their shoulders and tacitly acquiescing to their existence, as they do now.</p>
<p>Enlightening falsehood becomes an unbreakable evil for those who establish educational systems. I believe that a person must be determined not to obliterate the truth in their teaching in order to become a good teacher. The morality produced by concealing the truth is fragile in itself and will fail when it touches reality. It is often thought that understanding the truth of the facts is enough to lead people to cynicism, but this process is sudden. But if it is gradually understood, and at the same time it is understood what is good, and scientific research is undertaken to understand the truth due to the impulse to gain the truth, then there will be no adverse results. In short, lying to young people without the ability to distinguish is a morally indefensible crime.</p>
<p>If we want democracy to exist, the most important thing a teacher can do for their students is to develop an attitude of tolerance towards those who disagree with us. This may be a natural human impulse to feel fear and disgust for all habits and customs that are different from our own. Ants and savages often put foreigners to death. Those who have never traveled abroad or had spiritual contact with foreign countries find it difficult to tolerate the strange actions and beliefs of those belonging to another country, another era, another religion, or another political party. This intolerant attitude stemming from ignorance is in opposition to the future of civilization and is the most serious danger to our densely populated world.</p>
<p>The education system should correct this, but the current education system does very little in this regard. In every country, national sentiment is encouraged, and students are made to believe that people in other countries are morally and intellectually inferior to their own. The most insane and malicious collective neurosis in human emotions is not prohibited, but rather encouraged. At the same time, young people are made to believe unquestioningly in this irrational thing. Teachers are not to blame for all of this because they do not have the freedom to teach what they aspire to in their hearts. They deeply understand the needs of young people, and they are in constant contact with young people, but they have no say in deciding what should be taught and what methods should be used to teach. For this reason, I believe that education should have more freedom than it currently enjoys.</p>
<p>Teachers, like artists, philosophers, and writers, can only fully fulfill their mission when they are directly driven by their personal creative impulses and are not controlled and bound by the outside world. However, in the modern world, there is no room for individual existence. Individuals can appear at the top as dictators in totalitarian countries or as wealthy people in industrialized countries, but in the field of knowledge, it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain independent survival outside the organizational forces that control modern life. If the world does not want to lose its most valuable intellect, then it should disregard organizational forces and find ways to allow them to have room for free activity. This means that those who have power and understand that freedom should be granted to certain people should think deeply and restrain their power. The popes of the Renaissance had this awareness of the artists of the Renaissance, but contemporary authorities seem to lack respect for special talents. Perhaps we will have to wait until more peaceful times arrive before the demands of civilization can overcome the demands of party spirit. At the same time, some people should understand that the achievements of organizations are extremely limited. Every system should allow for flexibility, otherwise, it will inevitably cause the best of human nature to tend towards disintegration.</p>

<h3>Children's Weekly How to Read Books in the Library Yang Chunlu</h3>
<p>If your school has a complete library, that is your supreme happiness. Because the library is a treasure trove of knowledge, where many valuable books are hidden, available for us to borrow and read, to supplement the lack of textbooks.</p>
<p>But how do we use the library? When we go to the library to borrow books, we must first browse the book catalog, choose the books we like to read, fill out a borrowing slip, indicating our name, the name of the book borrowed, the number, the borrowing date, etc., and then borrow the book from the librarian.</p>
<p>When reading, you must be single-minded, have a beginning and an end, in order to benefit. It is best to take notes at any time; notes can help our memory and increase our insights.</p>
<p>After reading, return the book to the librarian and retrieve the borrowing slip. The period for borrowing books to read outside the library is generally limited, usually to one week. If you have not finished reading by the expiration date, you must renew the loan with the librarian. If you return the book overdue, you will be penalized.</p>
<p>You don't need any formalities to read newspapers. But after reading, you must return them to their original place.</p>
<p>Also, here are a few things to keep in mind when reading in the library:</p>
<p>1.  You must abide by all the rules of the library and follow the guidance of the librarian.</p>
<p>2.  Walk lightly when entering and exiting; moving chairs should not make loud noises either.</p>
<p>3.  When reading, sit upright with your back straight.</p>
<p>4.  Do not read two books at the same time.</p>
<p>5.  In the library, do not read aloud, let alone talk, laugh, or argue.</p>
<p>6.  Do not use saliva to turn pages or fold the corners of the book, and do not scribble on or tear up books; if there is any damage, you must compensate at the price.</p>
<p>Dear children! If you want to increase your knowledge, you should often go to that "treasure trove of knowledge"!</p>
<h3>The Reason for Falling Leaves Jin Jian</h3>
<p>A gust of autumn wind and a burst of rain blew the remaining hot steam of the hot summer to a distant place, and the cool air replaced the area of hot air, and the creatures on the ground ushered in another change—the sound of cicadas stopped, and the autumn insects' drums folded their wings; people added a piece of clothing to their thin clothes; the lush trees were dyed with a layer of declining yellow color; and even old yellow leaves, unable to withstand the wind and rain, fluttered from their old home and fell to the ground. This scene of change certainly shows that autumn has long arrived. Ah Ming certainly felt the coolness of autumn. Seeing the leaves falling slowly from the trees in the courtyard, he intentionally asked Ah Hui jokingly, "Why do leaves turn yellow and fall in autumn?"</p>
<p>"What's so much to ask! Because once autumn arrives, the leaves on the trees will definitely fall, this is a natural phenomenon," Ah Hui replied, seemingly laughing at her brother's stupidity.</p>
<p>"I know that leaves fall in autumn, what is the reason for that?" Ah Ming asked further, and Ah Hui was really unable to answer, and wanted to take this opportunity to go to the kitchen, but was stopped by Ah Ming.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter if you don't understand this, but don't leave. I can tell you and give you a satisfactory answer. Indeed, this question is not easy to answer. After autumn, the leaves turn yellow and wither, it seems that the leaves have completed their mission to the trees from spring to summer to autumn, and they can gradually wither. The dead leaves are of no benefit to the trees, so it doesn't matter if they fall. This statement is not wrong, but it is too unrealistic. We must first know what position the leaves occupy in the life history of trees? We must know that the leaves are the organs for trees to manufacture nutrients. They absorb oxygen and carbon dioxide from the air, and absorb water from the ground from the roots. These three raw materials are gathered on the leaves, and the leaves also contain chlorophyll, which is a machine for photosynthesis, and then uses the original power of sunlight, so that nutrients are made. This effect mostly occurs most frequently in spring and summer. After the nutrients are made, they must be transported to the roots and trunks, which all occurs in autumn. Some of the manufactured nutrients are stored in the roots and stems, and some are decomposed and utilized. When decomposed, a kind of energy is produced, which is obtained by absorbing sunlight, and the development and growth of trees requires energy. Therefore, spring is the period for making nutrients, autumn is the period for decomposing and transporting nutrients, and summer has several effects. The waste products of decomposition are also excreted from the leaves to the outside of the trunk, so the leaves are the place for manufacturing nutrients and excreting waste products, which is very important for trees. The reason for the falling leaves is to save the trees from useless consumption, and to store the nutrients for the lushness of the coming spring, so the falling leaves are entirely an exercise in frugality by the trees!"</p>
<h3>Min'er No Longer Loves Crickets Wang Cangping</h3>
<p>Crickets are our heroic warriors. Last autumn, Min'er raised several brave and good-at-war crickets, and pasted the titles of Ever-Victorious General and Invincible General on each clay pot. He carefully raised them at all times, and valued them very much. By the end of autumn and the beginning of winter, when the weather became colder and colder, these majestic generals could not resist the cold attacks, and their actions became sluggish at the same time; their calls were also weak and powerless. This kind of performance was no different from sending a cry for pity to Min'er. Min'er was certainly anxious, and hurriedly asked his mother for a lot of new cotton, and carefully spread it at the bottom of the clay pots, but the weak little lives still could not withstand the torment of the cold air, and died successively within a few days. After Min'er's sadness, he had to bury them.</p>
<p>This year, Min'er is already twelve years old, and his knowledge and concepts have made great progress with age. He accurately feels that there are more brave and meaningful warriors than crickets. Therefore, this year's Min'er deeply feels that the heart that loves crickets should be moved entirely.</p>
<p>It is now autumn wind, and the newspaper carries the collection of winter clothes. Min'er happily sent the two yuan he had saved to be used as a donation.</p>
<h3>Biography of Shirley Temple (15) Min</h3>
<p>"Cogan, listen, this is how I got such a good opportunity. One day, Mom asked Mr. George Wade to produce a film called 'Shame' for Elks Company, which required many little girls to perform singing and dancing programs. We received a phone call from his office and rushed there. At that time, there were more than three hundred girls, accompanied by their mothers or agents, who had already registered, so we couldn't get close to Mr. Wade. Mom was disappointed. But then a gentleman walked up to us, said to be the director, named Leo Hawk. He told Mom that he had seen 'Baby Take a Bow' before, so he recognized me as soon as he saw me. He said my past achievements were very good, and he would definitely help me in the future. He also told Mom that there might not be too much disappointment in Mr. Wade's film 'Shame'. This summons was just to test how many people would respond when they decided they needed little girls; but now it hasn't been decided yet. Finally, Mr. Hawk said that they would soon be making other films, and maybe they would need a girl like me, and then he would find a way for me. At the same time, he also wanted to see the 'Kid's Toys' movie to see how I performed.</p>
<p>One evening, my parents and I went to a movie theater in Beverly Hills to see a preview of the second part of "Kid's Toys." Mr. Hawk also came as expected; with him was a song writer named Mr. Conan. According to Mr. Conan, Mr. Will Rogers recently had a plan to produce a great musical film, with Mr. Sheehan as the producer, inviting Warner Baxter, Meg Evans, John Bowers, and Jamie Dunn to co-star, which had already been decided. This film also requires a little girl to play the daughter of Jamie Dunn, the position is not very important, but it also requires a smart and clever child to join this strong line. He told Mom that if she took me to the studio tomorrow, he could introduce me to Mr. Liu Bairang, who is helping Mr. Sheehan with the production and composition. He said that meeting Mr. Bairang was also a good thing, because he was the one who discovered Jack Cooper, and Jack became famous because of it. This time he might 'discover' me." We all laughed when we heard this; Dad laughed even harder, saying that Columbus, who discovered America, was a pity to be dead, otherwise he might have "discovered" me long ago.</p>
<p>The next day, we met Mr. Liu Bairang in the studio. Mom sat there just smiling. Mr. Hawk and Mr. Conan told Mr. Bairang about the films I had starred in before. Then Mr. Bairang said to me, "Shirley, let's see what your skills are." So someone played the "St. Louis Blues" on the piano, and I danced according to the rhythm, and imitated the style of Rodney Wanley singing on the radio a few days ago, and sang in a low voice. He was very surprised after watching it, and said immediately: "It's decided!" He was willing to sign a contract with me and assign me the role of that little daughter in the film. Sure enough, Mr. Liu Bairang "discovered" me!</p>
<h3>Several Problems in Elementary School Students' Compositions Meng Bai</h3>
<p>Due to my years of teaching Chinese in elementary schools, I have observed that most elementary school students make the following mistakes in composition class:</p>
<p>(1) Unwilling to Think Carefully When a topic is given, stupid students complain that it is difficult to do, and smart students can actually write something, but they are unwilling to put their heart into it. They just want to fill a few lines and hand in their papers, regardless of whether the content is well written or not.</p>
<p>(2) Handwriting Too Cursive Lately, most elementary school students are not very good at writing. In composition books, the words are mostly written in cursive. It's like their hearts. It's best to use a pencil or fountain pen to write, and they are most afraid of writing with a brush. In fact, you should write regular script in composition books.</p>
<p>(3) Like to Write Simplified Characters Even regular script is not well written, but they specialize in liking to write cursive or simplified characters, and even write them in a mess. When new teachers mark papers, they can't see what the words are. The so-called learn to run before you learn to walk, and you will never be able to write well again!</p>
<p>(4) Often Need to Revise Most elementary school students are too lazy to use draft paper for composition. If you can write straight down without using a draft, it is also okay. But they often write wrongly and arbitrarily revise the composition book, filling the blank line with words, so that the teacher has no place to write when grading.</p>
<p>(5) Unable to Distinguish Subject and Object Some elementary school students cannot distinguish the subject and object of each paragraph and each sentence. In fact, each paragraph and each sentence has a subject and object. Even if he or you is used in the previous sentence, they or you is used in the next sentence. Errors like this can often be found.</p>
<p>Anyone knows that if you make the above mistakes in composition, you will never progress. What's more, there are many other mistakes besides the above. Therefore, I hope that elementary school students in general can correct these mistakes in order to make progress in composition.</p>

<h3>X-Rays in the Entertainment Industry Hua Zhi</h3>
<p>Although the invention of film art has only been a few short decades, it has made great progress, such as changing from silent to sound, from monochrome to color, and from flat to three-dimensional, which can be described as extremely pleasing to the senses. Recently, what is being tested is to change from odorless to odorous, that is, the so-called "olfactory film"; the father has no need for film, using radio transmission. All this is already well-known, and what is coming one after another is the "transparent film", that is, X-ray shadow play, which is rarely mentioned.</p>
<p>It turns out that the invention of high-speed X-ray photography can photograph the movement of objects in one-hundredth of a second, penetrating the internal organization of objects. Mr. Slack, a technician at a certain industrial college in Westinghouse, USA, has recently achieved preliminary success in using X-rays to manufacture special light tubes. When it is installed under the lens, it creates a strange image through the surface and inside of the object.</p>
<p>This novel invention is being actively tested, and the content is extremely secret, but Hollywood producers have long been waiting, preparing to invest in the purchase of its production rights. Generally speaking, X-ray shadow plays are complicated to shoot, and the performance time will not be very long. Unless there are special programs, such as wonderful football, tennis, and golf matches, which can use slow motion to show the ball's progress. What is even more amazing is when the army and navy practice, how the cannon explodes from the barrel and rushes out of the muzzle, how the machine gun bullets travel in the air, and even how the grenades explode, X-ray shadow plays can clearly show them. The current shadow plays only show a wisp of white smoke and a loud noise when opening the gun. This is mostly disguised, which is very different from this.</p>
<p>In short, X-ray shadow plays will be of great help for shooting war films, monster films, or science adventure films. To what extent it will develop, we can only wait and see.</p>
<h3>Overseas Entertainment News Yong</h3>
<p>(1) Recently, the Berlin authorities screened several newsreels at a banquet to entertain foreign journalists. The films introduced the dynamics of German aircraft when they entered Rotterdam, the first commercial port of the Netherlands. After the banquet, an American journalist told people: "I couldn't see a single house in the Rotterdam area being damaged by the bombing in the picture." But later, according to the Reuters transmission, "The death of the people and the ravage of the city caused by the German aircraft bombing cannot be described in words or ink." From this, we can recognize that the sole purpose of German newsreels is to use them as propaganda tools. What they show is by no means a true news.</p>
<p>(2) Oxford University is the highest institution in the United Kingdom. Two months ago, male and female students under the age of twenty-one from the university borrowed one of the most famous theaters in London to perform a play to raise funds for a certain French relief association in England. The script of the play was called "Under Twenty-one."</p>
<p>(3) Paramount's newsreels will soon no longer be allowed to be screened in cinemas throughout Japan, according to an announcement by Tokyo officials. It is reported that this order must be implemented in the autumn of this year; thereafter, the newsreels on Japanese screens will be supplied entirely by companies organized by Japanese film merchants, and newsreels distributed by foreign merchants will be banned. (Note: Paramount's Shanghai authorities have not yet received a report on this news, so it has not yet been officially recognized.)</p>
<p>(4) Since the outbreak of the war, the United Kingdom has tried its best to increase the amount of various taxes. Recently, the cinema industry has also received a notice from the country's Ministry of Finance that a large part of their business must be used as the country's financial resources to cope with emergencies; for this reason, national film merchants have now decided to take the only way to raise ticket prices. This phenomenon can be said to be unprecedented in the history of the British film industry.</p>
<h3>"Sea Hero" Cast A Collection of Actors from Various Lei Film Companies A Gala Performance at the Majestic Theatre on Friday Evening He Ken</h3>
<p>A Collection of Actors from Various Lei Film Companies A Gala Performance at the Majestic Theatre on Friday Evening</p>
<p>"Sea Hero," co-directed by Wei Ruhui and Wu Yonggang, is the sequel to "Ge Nen Niang," depicting the heroic leap of Zheng Chenggong going to Taiwan to start an uprising after the second act. Since the establishment of the "New Art Theatre Company," Wei Ruhui has been engaged in the writing of this four-act tragedy. Six drafts have been revised in half a year, and the entire script was completed last month.</p>
<p>The "New Art Theatre Company" is organized by a collection of actors from various film companies. After receiving the mimeographed version, the AB system rehearsal was divided (probably conflicting with the company's filming work). On the one hand, the person in charge began to contact the performance site. The Carlton, which was rumored to be the ideal location at the earliest, did not succeed due to some reason. Therefore, it still cooperated with the Majestic Theatre, the memorial site of "Ge Nen Niang," and performed continuously for a week from the gala performance on the 27th (Friday).</p>
<p>The cast of "Sea Hero" is: Emperor Longwu (Sima Yingcai), Empress Zeng (Ding Zhi), Zheng Zhilong (Xu Li, Pei Chong, He Bin), Zheng Chenggong (Liu Qiong), Cang'er (Zhu Jiping), Guo Bichang (Tu Guangqi), Dong—Cheng Gong's wife (Shen Hao, Gu Lanjun), Bolo (Zhou Qi, Xi Meng, Zhang Zhizhi), Zheng Jing—Cheng Gong's son (Qian Yi), Zhang Mingzhen (Shu Shi), Zheng Yu—Cheng Gong's daughter Chen Qi), Ma Jinzi (Yan Fei)... The total number of actors is more than seventy, which is only seen after "Roar, China."</p>
<h3>Remembering Chen Delin's Disciples Plum Blossom Pavilion Master</h3>
<p>Reading the notes of Mr. Bingjiu Weiwei on the "Wang's Disciples" for several days, all the sections involving Chen Delin's disciples are incorrect. In the Bingjiu supplement on the 22nd, it said, "Although Wang (Huifang), Jiang (Miaoxiang), Mei (Lanfang), and Shang (Xiaoyun) are called Delin's disciples, they have not paid respect to him as a teacher. Delin's true disciple is only Wang Qinnong." This is also incorrect. According to Shitou's lifetime collection of students, there were a total of nine people. Those who entered the door in the early years of the Republic of China were Wang Yaoqing, Wang Qinnong, Wang Huifang, Mei Lanfang, Jiang Miaoxiang, and Yao Yufu (the above six people and their teacher once took a photo together, the teacher sat in the middle, and the six disciples stood apart in the back. This photo was enlarged by Lanfang in the photo studio and entrusted to a certain artist to make robes and jackets from silk and stick them on the photo, which looked quite realistic from a distance. This photo was made and jointly sent to the teacher by the six disciples as a permanent memorial, and the photo is still hanging in Shitou's hall.) Those who continued to be recruited after the tenth year of the Republic of China were Jiang Junjia and Huang Guiqiu. In his later years, he also recruited a Kun Opera famous actress, Ms. Han Qing (Shichang). After Ms. Han Qing, the door was closed from then on.</p>
<p>Master Cheng Yanqiu, the owner of Yushuang Studio, also often asked Shitou for advice. Shitou was very fond of Yanqiu, and would explain everything in detail when asked. Therefore, Yanqiu can also be regarded as one of Chen's direct disciples.</p>

<p>Chapter 7 "Take Him Away"</p>
<p>Hawthorne didn't answer, suddenly poked his head out and looked towards the turn, then immediately turned back. My heart was also pounding wildly. It turned out that the last time we were talking here, the swaggering person was Zhao Boxiong, who was the one who shot Hawthorne. With the development of this case, it seems to have gone from complicated to simple, and from suspense to tension.</p>
<p>Hawthorne asked in a low voice, "Where did you see him?"</p>
<p>A Gen also said in a low voice, "Right here - on the fifth floor." He pointed his hand to the lower floor. "Just now I went to the fifth floor to find Xiao Li, and suddenly saw this person. At first, I didn't pay attention. Unexpectedly, after he walked past me, he turned his head and stared at me, which made me remember that I had also seen him when I was talking with you near No. 776. When I thought about it again, I recognized that this person was the Qian who lived in No. 774."</p>

<h3>U.S. Entire Fleet to Return to Hawaii Periodically; Split into Three Teams to Patrol West Coast; Pacific Naval Strength Undiminished</h3>
<p>Washington – Secretary of the Navy Knox stated last night, after reporting on Anglo-American talks to understand the "police responsibility" of the United States in the Pacific, that the entire U.S. fleet would return to Hawaii on January 1 next year. It is reported that this fleet will be divided into three teams to patrol the west coast of the United States, so that the naval strength in the Central Pacific will not be reduced to less than two-thirds of its normal strength at any time. Each fleet will also stay on the west coast for two weeks, so that crew members can be given leave to return home, and ships can be repaired slightly. One team has already set off for California. Secretary Knox's remarks last night are indeed worthy of attention, as what he said is completely consistent with what has been revealed in the Washington Anglo-American talks on Pacific issues. The situation in the Pacific has been discussed by Secretary of State Hull, British Ambassador Lord Lothian, and Australian Minister Casey for three weeks. Furthermore, according to reports from various newspapers here, the Navy Department has ordered the U.S. Asiatic Fleet to assemble in the Philippines and ordered all ships stationed in Japanese-controlled waters to withdraw. However, according to Hull's statement to reporters yesterday, he had not heard a word about the concentration of the Asiatic Fleet, only seeing it in the newspapers. The Navy Department indicated that the movement of the Asiatic Fleet was purely routine, with southern patrols often conducted every autumn. (United Press dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>Plan for Separate Defense of Two Oceans; Anglo-American Agreement in Principle Reached</p>
<p>London – Authoritative circles announced last night that the United States and Britain have held several historic meetings in Washington in the past few days. Authoritative circles claimed that this discussion not only involved the Singapore naval base but also reviewed all issues thoroughly. This move is believed to have been prompted by Japan's actions in Vietnam and concerns that Japan might soon attack the Dutch East Indies. The talks in Washington may have a significant impact on whether Britain decides to open the Burma Road after October 18. Britain seems to be trying to avoid conflict with Japan, but well-informed circles here believe that the talks in Washington will improve the hope of American aid to Britain. American officials stated that the talks in Washington included a plan for the United States to defend the Pacific and Britain to patrol the Atlantic. It is reported that an agreement in principle has been reached on this matter. (United Press dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>London – A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that regarding the claim that Britain will allow the Singapore naval base to provide certain facilities to the United States, authoritative sources in London now claim that the United States and Britain, which have common interests in the Far East, have been adopting parallel policies for many years. On this basis, the facilities that Britain can allow the United States to use can be made available to the United States as needed by the development of the situation in the Far East. This has been the case for many years and will continue to be so in the future. (Reuters dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>U.S. Will Not Sit Idly By If Dutch East Indies Are Invaded; Relations with Japan Exceptionally Tense</p>
<p>Washington – Senator Elbert D. Thomas of the Foreign Relations Committee, stated here last night that if Japan invades the Dutch East Indies, the United States may use force to confront it. Although the United States opposes Japan's aggressive actions in Annam, it is more difficult to implement restraints. The Dutch East Indies is clearly a pivotal point of interest for the United States, and its relationship is extremely important. If Japan takes any action against it, the United States cannot remain indifferent. He said, "We would be utter fools if we allowed Japan to do as it pleases. I firmly believe that if the Dutch East Indies is threatened, the United States will take appropriate action." When commenting on the Japanese Imperial Conference's decision this week to pursue a policy of southward expansion, Senator Thomas said that he did not believe the Japanese navy would challenge the American fleet. He believes that even if such a development occurs, it may take the form of the current situation in the Mediterranean, where the British fleet patrols everywhere, while the Italian navy remains deep in port, its traces often far away on distant shores. He has not received notice of the details of the Anglo-American talks regarding the use of the Singapore naval base by the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands, but he strongly supports the idea of the American fleet gaining access to Singapore. He concluded, "Our interests are intertwined with those of Britain, so we must cooperate with Britain. Moreover, outside the Western Hemisphere, Britain is our only friend, and the United States should naturally take cooperative action with it." (United Press dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>Washington – As the situation in the Far East teeters on the brink of danger and relations between the U.S. and Japan become increasingly strained, the eyes of Washington officialdom are focused today on the following reports: 1. Negotiations between the Vietnamese authorities and the Japanese have broken down. 2. The U.S. fleet may use Singapore as a base. 3. If necessary, to prevent Japan from invading Vietnam. Secretary of State Hull, amid the serious atmosphere of reports of Japanese residents evacuating Vietnam, indicated yesterday that the U.S. fleet may use Singapore as its base. At the same time, well-informed observers said that several administrative leaders have begun to take active steps, advocating that the occupation of Vietnam by Japanese troops should be prevented. Hull said that the State Department is still exchanging detailed and candid information on the Far East with Britain and Australia. Although Hull indicated that the U.S. fleet may use the Singapore base, he also said that the U.S. government has not yet made any decisions on this matter. However, International News Service has obtained reliable information that Britain has fully expressed its approval of the U.S. fleet using the Singapore base. According to those close to Hull, relations between the U.S. and Japan are now exceptionally serious, and today's situation is vastly different from the previous situation between the two countries. Senior U.S. naval commanders, in view of Britain's situation in Europe and its "collapse" in the Far East, are working to obtain a firm position and have warned the government that further expansion of Japanese territory is dangerous.

<h3>To Prevent Japanese Southward Advance, Only by Intensifying Aid to China; U.S. Army Officer, New Zealand Writer Give Speeches in Philippines, Praising China's New National Spirit</h3>
<p>Manila – Major Carlson, formerly of the Navy and recently a U.S. military observer in China, and Bertram, a New Zealand author and journalist, both spoke at the University of the Philippines' Villamor Hall, advocating that foreign countries should provide China with all kinds of aid except for participating in the war, in order to contain Japan and prevent it from implementing its southward expansion plan. Carlson said that Japan wants to occupy the Philippines after the United States leaves. Carlson praised the new national spirit of China, the determination of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the Chinese people to resist Japan, and described the achievements of the Chinese Eighth Route Army in laudatory terms, saying that if China can be properly aided, it will definitely win the final victory. If Japan benefits, the Philippines and the United States will both suffer. He does not support any appeasement policy. Bertram said that Japan's war in China is the prelude to Japan's conquest of Australia. He advocated cooperation between Britain and the United States in the Far East. This speech was initiated by the Philippine-China Industrial Cooperation Association, and the audience was composed of members of the Philippine elite. Mrs. Sayre, the U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, also attended the lecture. (United Press dispatch from the 21st)</p>

<p>London – The Aid China Committee sent a letter to Prime Minister Churchill, stating that 1.3 million people in Britain have notified the committee that they are willing to support the immediate and unconditional opening of the Burma Road. The letter said that the current movement was organized at a very difficult time, with many problems arising in various aspects of transportation.

<h3>European Officers Among Japanese Troops in Shenzhen</h3>
<p>Hong Kong – As the Japanese troops in South China continue to increase, news has been received here that European officers have recently been seen among the Japanese troops in Shenzhen. Chinese farmers arriving in Kowloon have informed foreigners in Kowloon that they have seen Westerners in uniform among the Japanese troops stationed in Shenzhen. The authorities here believe that these European officers may be Italians or Germans. It is rumored that they are military advisors or liaison officers attached to the Japanese army, acting as scouts. It is also rumored that these European officers arrived in Shenzhen by plane from Shanghai via Guangzhou, so the Hong Kong military authorities are very concerned about them and are currently investigating. It is unknown whether there are Germans or Italians in Shenzhen. In view of the urgency of the situation in Vietnam and the gradual extension of the European war to British spheres of influence, the Hong Kong authorities are now doing everything possible to find out what these officers are up to. It is rumored that the Japanese army, in order to take action in Vietnam, has recently dispatched elite troops to the Shenzhen camp. The troops of Long Jintian (transliteration), originally stationed in Bao'an and Zhongshan, surrendered to Chongqing on September 2. Long's secret agents are currently active outside, seeking to persuade other troops to surrender to the National Government of China. The Japanese army seems to have abandoned its plan to advance north along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, as Chinese heavy troops are now stationed near Huizhou and Danshui. In short, the war in Guangdong Province is currently at a standstill. (International News Service dispatch from the 21st)</p>

<h3>Bank of China Savings Groups Exceed Quota</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The organization of savings groups is an important task of the current stage of the thrift and savings movement. It is observed that the two committees on savings have been dispatching section chiefs, commissioners, and staff to various agencies and organizations in recent days to discuss the establishment of groups, and satisfactory results have been largely obtained. It is understood that the groups belonging to various banks in Chongqing have been largely organized successfully. The Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Provincial Bank have all completed the procedures for organizing groups. Among them, the Central Bank of China, under the careful planning of group leader Chen Xing, organized savings groups consisting of 32 sub-groups and 70 branch groups in a short period of time by utilizing the bank's existing bureaus, offices, and local branch offices. The original target for savings and fundraising for the group was 3 million yuan. After organization and allocation, the amount of savings pledged has exceeded the original target.
