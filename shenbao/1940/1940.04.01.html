<h3>美政府民表宣言　決不承認南京偽組織　確認中國唯一合法政府在重慶　美國始終保持其應享各項權利</h3>
<p>華盛頓赫爾國務卿頃於本日發表宣言、聲明美國政府仍認中國國民政府為該國唯一合法政府、至於在精衛在南京所設立之「新政權、」則認為與某外國歷來在中國境內所樹立之政權、屬於同一性質、共目標僅在有裨於該外國之利益而已、茲將宣言原則摘要如次、</p>
<p>赫爾國務卿首謂、美國仍認重慶中國國民政府為唯一合法政府、美國對於以武力推行國策之方式、態度如何、業已迭决說明、當為世人所周知、美國政府特重言申明、凡依據國際公法與現行各種條約協定所享有之各項權利、美國仍當完全予以保留、至以「南京新政權而論、吾人參照一九三一年來中國其他若干地方所發生之類似情事、認為此項「新政權」之成立顯係某國迫令其鄰邦接受該國意志之進一步行動、此其目標、厥在阻止一幅員廣大之國家、與全世界其他各國保持正常的政治經濟關係、總之、某國曾迭决在中國境內樹立若干受其庇謎之新政權、此項新政權之任務、乃在便利該國本身之利益、並拒不聽任美國與其他各國僑民享受其由來已久之平等的公尤的待遇、而南京方面此次所發生之事件、卽為抄襲此項已成的新政權之故事而已、抑某國之高級官吏曾經迭次發表宣言、聲明該國準備尊重其鄰邦之政治獨立立塲與自由、並謂此項意願當由事實表現之、美國政府業將此項宣言、予以備案、但觀於「南京新政權」成立時之軍事的外交的情勢、似與此項意願、完全不符、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華盛頓國務卿赫爾昨日發出聲明、斥責竊取人民之政治主權侵略者、並聲稱美國決不承認」南京國民黨」曁在精衛之「南京政府、」赫氏係於「南京政府」成立之日發言、據謂、「美國必仍承認重慶政府與中國政府、該政府現仍擁有人民之擁護及後盾」、渠復稱「汪精衛政府」之成立、顯係「某國程序之另一步驟、以暴力掠奪鄰邦、而謀將世界某一大部土地與外界之政洽經濟關係、完全切斷、一故「南京新政府」實與中國國內之其他「新政權」同出一轍、乃被某外來暴力所科用，而否認美國及第三國人民長期建立之合法權利及公尤利益、美國政府業經注意及某國高級官員所發表之言論、謂該國尊重其鄰國之政治主權及自由、並將於東亞事態逐漸發展時實行此種意向、然無論軍事上或外交上、「新南京政府」之設立、似均不與此、種意向吻合、美國對於不承認以暴力為一國之政策之態度、乃無庸贅述者、美國對遠東事態之態度與地位、亦巳經屢次闡明矣、而此種態度始終未變、美國依然保持其維護國際公法及現有條約之權、美國政府於十二年前與其他各國一致承認中華民國之國民政府、美國政府確信中國政府之首都在重慶、於過去及未來均護該國人民之擁戴、故美國政府始終承認國民政府為中國之唯一合法政府、」（三十一日合衆電）</p>
<p>華盛頓赫爾國務卿昨日發表宣言、聲明美國仍認中國國民政府為唯一的合法政府之後、參議院外交委員會主席畢德曼頃亦向報界發表談話、加以聲援、力言美國決不承認「南京在精衛政府」、幷謂日本違反華府九國公約依然如故、彼南京方面所成立之新政府、原為日本當局所創造、并非眞正的中國政府、而為類似「滿洲國」政府之傀儡政府、美國權益在滿洲以及所謂「南京新政府」轄境內所受之待遇、吾人巳知之甚諗、因此余對於赫爾國務卿昨日所發表之宜言、熱烈加以贊成、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華盛頓美國務卿赫爾及東京日本政府對中國成立「新南京政府」所發表之聲明、據昨日消息靈通方面稱、自美國廢止美日商約以來、日美間發生之裂痕、巳日漸深闊、赫爾用此種率直語氣發表聲明、誠屬稀見、而東京政府所反覆申述之觀點、即為美國所決心反對者、有勢力之參院外委會主席畢德曼云、「予對赫雨聲明、心悅誠服、」並聞拉丁阿美利加諸國亦將追隨美國之後、對汪精衛之「新政　」不予承認、（三十一日合衆電）</p>
<p>重慶　日此間政界、認美國務卿赫爾、為在精衛領導下之「南京政府」成立所發表之聲明、係美國對華最懇摯友誼之表示、該聲明要點、謂縱令侵略蔓延、美政府始終把握正義之途徑、（三十一日合衆電）</p>
<p>東京今日外務省發言人、對於華盛頓電訊所傳美國務卿赫爾對於汪精衛政權、巳宣布一種不承認政策之消息、拒絕發表評論、以待關於此事之官方情報惟該發言人曾表示其個之意見、謂此項消息、可認為係美國對東亞眞正局勢缺乏諒解之證據、赫氏此項言論、殊與十二月三十日之美國牒文、聲明美國將不猶豫而承認現在發展之局勢者、互相矛盾、（三十一日路透電）</p>
<h3>王外長發表談話　稱道美正義　赫爾闡明美國立場　對華友誼更進一步</h3>
<p>重慶美國國務卿赫爾發表美政府對南京偽組織決不承認之聲明後、合衆社駐渝記者、當卽走訪王外長叩詢意見、王外長發表如下之談話美國維護國際法與國際秩序之立塲、決不因虛偽之宣傳或任何政治上之偽裝而有所改變、今者美國已再度聲明該國決否認武力所造成之局面、日本軍人當知其獨霸亞洲及太平洋之計劃、必將成為泡影、赫爾國務卿之聲明、足以表示自一九三一年九一八事變以來美政府對於遠東所發生之事件、已有深切之認識、中國政府與中國人民聞悉之餘、甚表歡愉、蓋此係中美傳統友誼之進一步表示、亦卽所以明白表示美國所取之政策、卽係維護九國公約、非戰公約等國際條約之尊嚴、七七事變以來、日方軍閥擴大其侵略行為及於中國之大部領土、日軍之不名譽行為、已為美國人士所週知、日方雖會屢次對第三國提出諾言、然在華之第三國權益業被其蹂躪無遺、所謂「東亞新秩序」僅為在華建立一日本政權之烟幕、此日本政權假中國偽裝、而將西方各國在亞洲之權益完全排斥、中國對美國之正義感信仰彌篤、且覺以中國抗戰之決心、終必有公理戰勝强權之一日、日本最近表演之傀儡戲、徒供中國人民之輕蔑資料耳（三十一日電）</p>
<p>駐外使館送達照會</p>
<p>華盛頓中國駐美大使胡適博士、頃於本日以該國國民政府申斥「南京新政府」之照會一件、送達國務院、其措詞與該國駐其他各國使節所分別送達駐在國政府者相同、力言參加此項「新政府」者、純為日本軍閥所製造與控制之傀儡、中國國民政府茲特鄭重聲明「任何非法組織、如目下正在南京成立者、或在中國其他各處成立者、不問出以何種行為、當然完全無效、中國國民政府與人民、絕對不予承認、（三十日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>巴黎中國　法大使館頃於本日發表該國國民政府聲討「南京新政府」之宣言書據接近該大使館之中國人士談稱、該國駐外各使節、尤其是駐英法美比德蘇各國使節、均曾致電國民政府曁「中國全國同胞」、聲討所謂「南京新中央政府」、幷指參加其事者為「叛逆」、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>美報贊助赫爾宣言</p>
<p>紐約赫爾國務卿昨日發表宜言、聲明美國決不承認「南京新政府」之後、紐約泰晤士報頃為文加以贊成、幷謂蔣介石上將所領導之國民政府、乃眞正的中國政府過去旣曾尊重各國權利、今後亦　應尤繼續為之、其所統治之土地、尙佔中國全國版圖一半以上、且此際正以全力抵抗有史以來最無理由之侵略行為、因此吾人主張華府九國公約　他各簽　國、務當加緊加以鼓勵與援助云、（卅　日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>克萊琪演說與英國遠東政策</h3>
<p>英日間的外交關係，一向被人看做一個微妙問題，而且時常在國際間發生種種猜疑誤解。此種不幸的情事，一部分自然由於譸張為幻者流的陰謀搆煽，企圖在世人的猜度驚疑當中獲致混水摸魚的效果，但另一方面，有時也未始不因為當事者態度的噯昧游移，致益增各國人士的惶惑；例如前此不久關於英日締結密　和天津白銀問題已歸解決的消息，都不外是屬於前一現象的謠傳，而近一二日頗引起英美輿論界為之騷動的英駐日大使克萊琪演說，則却是後一情形的顯例。</p>
<p>克萊琪氏的演說，縱已在英美引起憤懣和抨擊，但直到此刻，我們尙未獲見演詞的全文。單就路透社所發表的片段來看；則除克氏認為英日關係有妥協可能而外，如所云「渠已以日政府宣布之意志與所成就之成功計劃置諸心頭」，「兩國彼此已漸覺以往數年中對方行動之受貶毀與訛傳」，「眞正糾紛之為種種誤會與訛言所籠罩之程度，輙由第三方面之不受歡迎的注意所助成」，等等詞句，確具有嚴重的語病，且予人以惡劣印象，很容易被解釋為英國的遠東政策正向着與世人期望相反的方面演進。連日英美輿論頗以遠東慕尼黑運動又將復活及美國孤立派獲有新的藉口為慮，細繹克氏演詞，確也是應有的感想。</p>
<p>兩三年來，英國在遠東固然履行了若干的國際義務，而其始終徘徊動搖的對日態度，則殊不無可議之處；尤其自歐戰爆發而後，因為要傾全力以應付歐陸，在東方更不免多所牽就事實，以期减少掣肘。這種苦衷，世人固能予以相當原諒；即在英國自身，亦曾迭次申述其絕不改變格守九國公約及國際義務的根本立塲。而在暴戾恣唯的侵略者，則並不瞭解英方這種委曲求全的苦心，反而視為可欺，肆以毫無理性的舉措相挾持。結果英國這種政策的運用，除却自隳聲威而外，實屬、一無所獲。試看年餘以來第三國人士在中國淪陷區所遭遇的苛遇和凌辱，當以英人為最甚；即以最近一月間而言，有如天津租界封鎖的加緊，北方各城市排外運動的復熾，彰德莠民脅迫外人的暴行，亦皆以英人為主要對象，並不因英日仍在東京從事談判而稍形弛緩，而且也不見得是英方繼續讓步所能轉移。最近日方在中國所發動的政治攻勢，顯以獨佔中國並排除第三國權益為唯一目標；在這種情勢之下，如果英國還準備繼續對日妥協，甚至動搖了自身一貫立塲，那不只更增加了遠東局勢的繁雜與艱危。即在英國本國，亦將如日前倫敦新聞紀事報所指出的：將使英國所作抵抗侵略的一切主張悉成荒唐無謂，連英國進行戰事所必需的內國團結，亦將受有嚴重打擊。這些都是頂簡單的常識，英方當局富不致見不及此。</p>
<p>現在遠東的主要安定力，一方面是中國，另一方面是美國，已往遠東慕尼黑一類對日妥協約企圖，已咸因中美兩國立塲的堅定不拔而歸幻滅．最近日方政治攻勢又達到新的節段，繼中國國民政府之後，美國方面亦於前日發出了嚴正的否認聲明，、這無疑會嚴重影響着英國以及其他各國在遠東的行止，並打擊一切對侵略者妥協讓步的企圖。所以克萊琪的那一演說，至多不過是外交辭令上的一種姿態，縱然會使侵略者發出會心的微笑，但却又招致主持正義人士的憤懣，却並不見得能代表英國整個外交路綫的動向。如果英國遠東政策眞要向着另一前途轉變，那必須先要犧牲中國的友誼和美方的同情，且其自身也要拚着招致不利影響的危險，這至低限度在目前還是不容想像的事。</p>

<h3>中年男子健康衰頹及腎虧後的補救辦法</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞動大學醫科學業楊道南醫師</p>
<p>誰都知道人生最快樂的時代，莫如青春，這因為青年人精強力足之故，若一個人到了中年之後，就會感到精力不足，一切都不能喚起他的興趣，好似日之西墜，已沒落了一樣，尤其是性慾的一部，時時有心有餘而力不足的感恨，故此種人在組織甜密的夢的時候，同陷對方於乏味的悲哀，故從實際的經騐所知，中年男子如有腎虧毛病時，若聽其自然，繼續不已，則夫婦之愛情，必不能圓滿。</p>
<p>雖然，有的因衛生得當，攝生有術，雖至中年之後，他的精力及性慾，都較青年人健全，不過這比較少數而已，所以中年人因體弱所煩惱者，仍然多不勝指，其中尤以性的一部為最劇烈，患此的原因，完全由於手淫過度，或縱欲與荒淫所致，致新陳代謝的機能减退，性慾亦連帶不振，故常有遺精滑精，早洩陰痿，及神經衰弱等症。</p>
<p>照現代最進步的醫學論　，人體最重要之腺器為生殖腺，因為生殖腺內分泌旺盛之後可使身體各部發育繁榮，性機能健全有力，根據這科學的有力證據，德國生理學家梅倫博士歲發明生殖腺內分泌製劑男用「補體康」，功能補腦，補血，補腎，補血，凡患遺精滑精，早洩陰痿，發育不全等症，服後保證回春有望，當余在俄國勞動大學研究醫學時，曾將「補體康」在臨床上應用七　，從未遇失效的病例。</p>

<h3>驅淋藥之新彗星</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌醫師</p>
<p>年來對於驅治淋病各種療法，真是有如雨後春筍，令人目迷五色，無所適從之慨。不過以余年來對於淋病的治療，確已較前順利而有把握，因余對於淋病的解剖，旣憑科學和經騐為之　別，而用藥方面，又有特效藥出，給予吾人以強大之助。</p>
<p>說起來病特效藥之發明，也不是偶然之事。原來淋病之傳染力，旣然十分強大，而經傳染，宛如厲鬼隨身，永遠不能脫離。惟自「新克淋儂」發明後，則此種病毒，已有根本解決之事也。故在「新克淋儂」未發明之前，簡直使病家無法解脫自身之痛苦。每染白濁，由急化慢，由慢而復見惡化，一人惡化之淋病，其毒更如膠投漆，永難解。而且險象環生，輕則有喪失　育，洗下分蕭條之　，　則有喪生失命之悲，故於此等病患，實不可輕藐視之。各國政府，鑒於淋病之能减弱國民之體健，因獎勵科學家，希望發明一種特效藥，而重賞之下，果有勇夫，德國彼得博士，旣首着天鞭，發明「克淋濃」，近復又改良採用最新化學療法製劑而發明「新克淋儂」（太和大藥房有售）。服後能將各處淋菌，全部掃滅，無一留殘致為後患。於是「新克淋儂」遂為世界各國醫家目為驅淋之新彗星。其名之盛，是可與德國獅牌梅毒特效藥「六〇六」一藥並駕齊驅。凡不論初起或已成慢性白濁，服「新克淋儂」，均能於最短期內發生抗淋噬作用，而絕對毫無不良之反應。與市上一般化學療法，大相徑庭。自有「新克淋儂」一藥發明之後，一切新起痛楚不堪之急性白濁，與遠年不治之老白濁，服用「新克淋儂」，無不應手取效。絕對可以保證根治。此為余多年與一般淋藥互相參比而證明也。</p>

<h3>淋毒變症後之挽救</h3>
<p>如何變症　如何診斷</p>
<p>淋病之病源菌，其繁殖力最速，一着吾人體內，卽行努力破壞病家的健全組織。淋菌毒素在其間發生了浸潤的作用，此種浸潤是由於淋菌所產生之毒素，着於健全組織，因而發生浸潤生炎症，而產生出分泌物，由尿道間流出，卽　出之白濁是也。患者在初起時固然僅限於前尿道，但往往由前尿道而後尿道，由後尿道而浸入膀胱，而成膀胱炎，腎臟炎，由後尿道而浸入攝護腺而成攝護腺炎，精囊炎、　系炎，睾丸炎。復有淋菌血液的循環，而發生關節炎，凡此等等，均為淋病之變症，而必須用科學方法以資診斷之。</p>
<p>對於變症　宜用特治</p>
<p>對於淋病的變症，旣經用科學方法診斷明白之後，即用對症方法治療之，而其中可稱為全能的療法者，惟有最新淋病化學療法製劑「新克淋儂」（中西，正威諸藥房均售）一藥，功效最優。因為「新克淋儂」係根據殺菌扛淋力　打，而絕無反應之成分，因之服用「新克淋濃」後，能使存在體內之淋菌，兜底掃盪，而加以完全撲滅。余一方更用德國最新發明之感應靜電療法，德國抗淋血清，交互為用，則任何淋病的變症，均能尅期根本治愈，至於女子淋毒白帶，亦可服用「新克淋儂」，一方用「卡而雪地陰　片」為坐藥，則帶止濁　，自可免去輾轉傳染之苦了。診時：上午十時至下午六時自即日起每天送診廿號每號僅取號金五角</p>
<h3>鎮咳止肺秘訣　盛在强醫師</h3>
<p>不論中醫西醫，對咳嗽一症，均屬難治之症，故肺病之多，遠過任何傳染病，而其死亡率，亦實覺驚人也。故一般人不可以為傷風咳嗽，是一小疾，而不加治療，倘不幸而由咳嗽的不治變為肺病，則患者亦不應悲觀，其實肺病亦非如一般醫家所說那樣可怕，只要攝生和醫治得法，其他並無神秘，依余經騐所得，「補肺拿　」一藥，頗有鎮咳止肺之特效，不論病狀至二三期之吐血，服此已能絕對根治，然當在治愈時間，宜安靜切勿勞動，並多攝取富有滋養料之食品，則所患尤易治愈了，此為肺癆必愈之條件。</p>

<p>上海市場之自我管理問題</p>
<p>上海市場動亂之源,似以外力的壓迫,與內在遊資蠢動為最大。其病態以投機狂熱與物價狂漲為最嚴重。在政治性之統制暫時不能進行之今日，似惟有實施自我管理之一法。　來各業公會並非不在努力，然效果至微。此係自我管理制本身無效乎？抑自我管理之技術不善乎？在此兩租界當局現正籌劃平衡本市物價之際，吾人殊應多所貢獻，以資合作，而謀社會福利以至國計民生之維持。本刊特以此為第三次座談會（過去已舉行過二次）之議題，敦請專家，於昨日會同討論，出席者有潘恒勤，潘仰堯，王海波，魏友棐四位先生，由沈文彬先生速記。精言偉論，頗有收穫。會議記錄當於下期本刊發表。此外又收到潘恒勤先生及法租界公董局物價委員陸高誼先生書面意見二件·茲先將議題網要及書面意見發表如次，歡迎各界亦多多發表意見；本刊在可能範圍內當充分刊佈。</p>
<p>（一）市場的自我管理，足當穩定上海市場之重任否？</p>
<p>（一）市場管理成功，市民受惠至夥，自不待言。然工商界將在何種目的之下，亦樂於自我管理？（因工商界若不樂意，或不樂意之原因太大，或不樂意之份子太多太普遍，則其實施上之阻力必多，效果必少。然則其不樂意之處何在？）</p>
<p>（一）目前各業實施之自我管理，顯鮮成效；其故何在？</p>
<p>（一）自我管理與自我監督似應相輔而行；然應如何進行？</p>
<p>（一）游資之自我管理，與自我監督，應如何進行方有效？</p>
<p>（一）物價之自我管理，與自我監督，應如何進行方有效？</p>
<p>（一）目前各業辦理自我管理時有何困難最不易解決？</p>
<p>（一）自我管理與自我監督時，消費者與產銷者必需合作；然應如何合作方有效？</p>
<p>（一）理想的自我管理制度之實施機構，應如何組成？</p>
<h3>書面意見之一</h3>
<p>— 陸高誼</p>
<p>一、自我管理的動機，不外乎（一）良心作用；（二）輿論制裁。但這兩種動機，都只有道義上的責任；所謂Moral　Obligation，而缺乏法律的強制力；因此，自我管理的結果，難以有較好的成績。</p>
<p>二、市場是由供求兩方面所搆成的，或說是由產銷兩方面所配合起來的；因此，自我管理的力量，必須能達到產銷兩方面；否則，就難以見效了。</p>
<p>三、市場與其他的關係，更是錯綜複雜，所以縱使有正人君子，熱心於本位內的自我管理，但因外來的牽制，防不勝防，一旦遇到，他就沒有方法解決了。何况，就是對於本位內的自我管理，因份子的複雜，要管理得好，也很不容易呢？</p>
<p>四、所以我以為，除非自我管理的範圍，能擴大到自給自足的地步，那是可以有效的；否則，就難以有效。不過，話要說回來，有總比沒有好，效力雖然不大，我們仍不妨提倡；因為道義的責任，雖不及法律的有效，但多少總有點好處的。至於想以自我管理來解決目前上海市場的動亂，那未免是奢望了。</p>
<h3>書面意見之二</h3>
<p>— 潘恒勤</p>
<p>（一）穩定上海市場之辦法，自以政府出面統制為最佳，但現在上海情形特殊，舍政府力量外，求其次自以市場的自我管理一法較有効，而在當前狀况下，亦唯有促進市場自我管理之技術方能達到穩定市場之目的。</p>
<p>（二）欲工商界樂於施行自我管理，必須設法驅除其一味牟利之目的，易言之，工商界應以愛護國家愛護社會為目的，市場果能穩定後，則間接亦不啻為減輕自己之生活負担，且更可獲得社會人士極政府當局之嘉譽。</p>
<p>（三）各業自我管理顯鮮成功之原因：（一）自私牟利之觀念太深，（二）公會組織容或未能盡善，（三）情面徇私，（四）無法檢舉，（五）無法制裁。</p>
<p>（四）自我管理確應與自我監督相輔而行，其法以各業公會為管理之單位，各業相互間固應互相監督，而市商會尤應認真負起監督之任務，其他方面尤其為輿論界應發動輿論制裁，儘量由記者調查採訪，並詳為檢舉披露，個人或業中人出面向新聞界，商會，公會檢舉告發者，應代為保證不洩露其人之姓名。</p>
<p>（五），（六）（一）金融界應加緊合作，嚴格拒做或催贖投機性之商品押款，（二）金融界對於投機商號及銀號應减少其往來，（三）竭力提高棧租。</p>
<p>（七）目前自我管理之最大困難，厥為所訂限價不易執行，暗盤不易防止，而究其實，則仍以公會本身旣缺制裁力量，更乏勇毅決心，最為可憾。</p>
<p>（八）產銷雙方應予合作之點：（一）在此非常時，務須厲行節約運動，（二）减少次要品之消費，例如米價甚高，則應少製酒類及糕饅（因其原料均為白米或糯米），俾必需之飲食可以維持，（三）消費者切勿大量購藏，（四）組織消費合作社，例如銀錢業聯誼會之合作社，又如民食調節會之集團購米均是，（五）消費者購買時如發覺商人有投機囤積嫌疑，應盡量持　證據檢舉告發。</p>
<p>（九）試擬自我管理之理想機構圖表如下：</p>

<h3>論洋米之跌價及其展望</h3>
<p>— 張宗裕</p>
<p>貨物之價格決定於供求關係，凡供給多而需求少者，其價必賤，反之，需求衆而供給稀者，其價必昂，此古今中外不變之貨物供求律也。（The　Law　of　Sapfly　and　Dew　and）平準均輸，不外此理，乃夫今日，事有反常，物愈湧到而其價愈昂。早漲夕貴，漲勢之銳，莫可抗禦，供求鐵律似不可信耶？此也！此乃一時投機操縱之結果，初非事實之打破理論也！以其為投機之後果，至不合理，故其漲也迅，降也速，若曇花之一現，終未能見其久長也。觀乎近日海上之洋米市，信然！信然！</p>
<p>新年紅盤之開盤也，人心激昂，羣以為本歲法幣購買力將益形下降，積幣不如積穀，爭相搜購，而舊囤戶則堅持不出；匯票報緊；洋行兜價報漲，種種刺激，價乃一飛沖天，若一號西貢，由隔歲四十三元收盤而一躍至四十八元開盤，未五日（二月十六日）更飛躍至最高峯五十三元！其後，獲利了結紛起，價乃進至五十元關內，而成盤旋之狀。不半月而本月初，價乃逐步下挫，迨乎本月二十一日，若一號西貢，僅開三十八元！一瀉千里，如是之速，固為操縱投機者自食其果，不足為惜！茲敢為一述其所以跌價之原因焉。</p>
<p>（一）定貨湧到，銀根不能週轉　考洋米之訂購，係一種期貨為性質，祗須向洋行繳足定洋，即可訂購，此項定洋，初時為貨價之半，後减為十分之三。經營雜糧之行商，鮮有資本雄厚者，前時或傾其所有訂購洋米，原擬市價即漲，即將其路貨拋售，乃因紅盤一轟過高，引起獲得多頭了結，價格欲漲無力，勢或盤旋，稍一觀望，而價更挫。而所訂之米，則已到埠，欲收無力，銀行押款，不能染指，乃不得不相繼忍痛蝕本拋出！鮮有備資收貨者。故到貨愈湧、拋售愈烈，價愈下挫！</p>
<p>（二）產地報鬆　今日匯水雖縮，第因洋行代表產地貶價拋售，兜價旣賤，即不覺匯水之縮，故新成交價有在今之市價以下者，做心恩者，莫不趁賤訂購，猶冀匯水更縮，產價報漲而獲利也。訂貨旣多，影響人心，出　更多。</p>
<p>（三）存底豐厚，銷　滯呆　據非正　統計，滬地現有存米約達一百萬包，而到貨猶擁塞於途。故有底極豐，而銷路則較前為呆。蓋自滬地生活奇昂以還，人口即行下降，約自五百萬降至四百萬，前每日需米一萬包者，今八千包足矣：且也，中上產之家，莫不積有數月之糧，甚者更積有年糧亦不以為罕，今旣見其價下降，更不致繼續糴進，影響本地　銷不少。</p>
<p>（四）國米日有到滬　去年全國豐收，本非缺米，乃因日偽攔阻，來源不暢，致造成洋米世界。今者，常錫國米，日有到埠，雖其數不多於清明假期中亦到有六七千包！）然亦聊勝於無。且國人索米杜米，洋米自受影響。</p>
<p>（五）平　與集團訂購　慨自米飛漲以還，各工廠團體，即相繼直接訂購，此亦影響實銷不少；而平　救濟赤貧，門裝零糴，益形减少，米商心理，不無影響。</p>
<p>（六）麵粉平　　加之，近日麵粉平　，中下之家每有改用麵粉者，雖為數不多，要亦影響實銷！</p>
<p>（七）棧租增高　近日更有一大原因，即向為堆米大本營之羅斯福堆棧，近來突然增加棧租，一期改作兩期。論者以為：棧租增加，將使米商成本愈益增高，米商將轉嫁於消費者，則因何而反為米價下降之大原因？其實，彼固知其一而未知其二。蓋訂貨湧到，其價勢必下降，若在堅持不出，將益增共損，故必從速出手。若謂轉棧，則租界內之堆棧，早為其他囤貨所擁塞，即或可轉堆若干，惟為數不多，若租界外之堆棧，則惟恐他日出米時有問題，米商未敢嘗試也。</p>
<p>今日洋米跌價固矣！其將來之趨勢固若何耶？依予推測，米價將續趨下游，至少或為盤旋下降，開漲則將毫無希望，其理：</p>
<p>（一）據本月二十六日報載統計，滬地存米已達一百萬包以上，此外，已訂未到之路貨，亦達二三十萬包之多！即以此數，亦足維持半年之久，且也，在今後數月內，竟無些微定貨乎，若洋行兜價再行見貶，則必有大量訂貨，來源旣湧，價自不至於高。</p>
<p>（二）近月來，國米日有到埠，雖為數不多，然來源似尚不至於斷。若日偽固能减少阻碍，則到貨之擁，將不亞於洋米，國人素喜杜米，至此，則必捨洋米而就國米，洋米之實銷被奪，其重要性旣失，自欲漲無力。</p>
<p>（三）慨自海上生活程度日高以還，人口即在逐漸减少中，則現今日需八千包者，他日容或减至五六千包，而存底旣豐，到貨復擁，洋米尚有上漲之力乎！</p>
<p>觀乎上述三點理由，洋米當不至再漲也。</p>
<p>論者或以為：「二十五日假後開盤，米價復趨上游，乃以此為上漲之朕兆者，」其實，此固非上漲之朕兆也。大漲小回，大回小漲市價之變動，固成曲綫形者。且也，數日休假，門莊自須稍事添辦，以應門銷，乃或因此刺激市價，則其勢至暫，不久將見其下降，可不必過濾。</p>
<p>「匯水日日報縮，將影響訂貨成本」。此點似是而實非，何則？蓋所謂匯水報縮者，係指美匯而言。若先令則非常穩定，且有放長之勢。法郎之匯價亦至為穩定。洋米來自西貢，安南，緬甸，等處，結匯者，英法匯而非美匯也</p>
<p>「訂貨湧擠將刺激產地報價」，此點亦不足慮，西貢等地生產過刺，區區上海訂貨殊不足刺激其市價也。若民國十九二十年間，全國大水，洋米進口者達六七百萬包，產地固因此而報漲乎？此非明證耶。</p>
<p>「歐戰有延長之勢，英法或將禁止糧食出口」。但西貢安南等地，地處熱帶，生產過剩，政府獎勵出口之不遑，安有禁止出口之可能？若論積儲糧食，則彼固以麥為大宗，而非以米為其對象也。</p>
<p>近日洋米北運似為數不多，上海存底將因此减少。此點亦屬不確。蓋上海原為一貨物集散之轉口碼頭，若干北幫，上海派有坐莊，就地訂購，　訂貨到上海，若滬地市價高漲，即在上海報銷，否則即歸北運。洋貨進口，海關例有若干日猶預　，以為商人候輪轉口之用。洋米若一經報關進口，即不准復出。此批北運之米，原無一定報銷目的地，今因上海市價低，故而北運，初非搬自上海者。若一旦上海市價復高，則此批北幫所辦之米，因北運之不合，自即在上海報銷，此批洋米實無形中在穩定上海米價也。</p>
<p>商人將本求利，買賤賣貴，原為不易之理，予固不忍獨責米商。　民以食為天，　管至此，若有所不能已自者，願為米商略進　言。</p>
<p>夫國家正浴血抗戰，凡我商民，正宜同舟共濟，操縱投機，自非應該，而况有關民米食之米乎？此次洋米突然下跌，蝕本者諒不在少數，資本薄弱者，倒閉且隨！此固為投機者自食其果，不足為惜。往昔已逝，來者可追。願米商受此教訓後，從此歇其操縱之念，行將見全市民之額手稱慶而祝頌也。且也，觀諸以往歷史，投機洋米者，莫不一敗塗地，蓋我國商人，墨守陳法，對於採銷數額，向無統計，一遇缺貨即爭相訂購洋米，來貨旣湧，價必不支下降，虧本自不可免。嘗憶民國廿三四年間江南大旱，米商紛紛訂購洋米，不數月而訂貨三四百萬包已到滬，惟事實上根本不　此鉅數，價格下跌至烈，米商因此破產者不鮮。　悸猶在心頭，而投機之故念復萌，米商具猛醒乎？更者訂購洋食，終有傷國家資金，曷向採購國米進行，設法疏其來源，匪獨商人自身之利，亦國家之益也。</p>

<h3>非常時期過分利得稅簡算法</h3>
<p>— 巢紀梅</p>
<p>非常時期過分利得稅，已於二十七年十月二十八日由財政部公佈，於二十八年十月修正，二十八年一月一日開始徵收，本事務所（大同法律會計事務所）鑒於各商號感覺其計算方法過於繁複，且易生錯誤，今為補救之計，特製成簡算表一種，及計算步驟五條，會同計算，實可省時省力多頁，茲舉三例說明如次，</p>
<p>簡算表　（以資本1〇，〇〇〇為單位）</p>
<p>（例一）公司資本為一萬元，盈餘為一萬元，應納利得稅之計算方法如左：</p>
<p>（一）先計算資本與盈餘之百分率，（1〇,〇〇〇—1〇,〇〇〇），為百分之一百，查利得稅條例第四條第六項規定，利得額超過資本額百分之六十以上者，其超過額一律徵百分之五十，故以下分二步計算，即盈餘百分之六十與百分之六十以上是也。</p>
<p>（二）次查簡算表「已」項（即百分之六十部份）項下納稅累數為一，〇二五元，</p>
<p>（三）以資本乘百分之六十（已項），得六〇〇〇元，再以盈餘一〇，〇〇〇元减六〇〇〇元，得百〇〇〇元，此即為盈餘四分之六十以上部分，</p>
<p>（四）次查簡算表「午」項下之納稅率為百分之五十，故以四〇〇〇元乘百分之五十，即得二〇〇〇元，</p>
<p>（五）以第二款一，〇一五元，第四款二〇〇〇元，相加得三〇二五元，此乃應納利得稅之總額也。</p>
<p>（例二）公司資本二〇，〇〇〇元，盈餘為八，〇〇〇元，其應納利得稅之計算方法如左：</p>
<p>（一）先計算資本與盈餘之百分率（八、〇〇〇—一一〇、〇〇〇）為百分之四十，</p>
<p>（二）次查簡算表「卯」項下納稅累數為二二五元，以乘二（因此例資本額為二〇，〇〇〇元為表中資本額之二倍），得六五〇元，即為應納利得稅之總額也，此例資本合盈餘百分率，適為整數，自在百分之六十以下，故則須查簡算表即得，（未完）</p>

<h3>丈夫精力衰弱後的悲慘　做妻子的也有責任……</h3>
<p>「人慾橫流」這四個字，已夠形容當今社會的動態了。一個男子當未婚以前，滿想和一個健美女郎結合，來度他們幸福的生活，這本是很普遍而應當的，可是旣婚以後已佔有了一個女子，每每還以為不足，據心理學家的推測，當一個男子慾望擴張的時候，似乎可以容納幾打以上的女人，這並非虛語，事實上確有這種人。不過這樣牛馬似的精力的人畢竟是太少了。大多數的男子只是惑於一時的淫興，趁一時的慾火，而種下了以後無窮盡的痛苦！</p>
<p>荒淫縱態的為害，等於一棵樹木的旦旦而伐其根幹。根幹一斷，樹木必傾倒。男子的荒淫縱慾，等到一旦精疲力盡，他的生命也就危殆了。此外一個青年男子的犯有手淫遺精，或早婚等行為，對於身體的戕害亦至大且巨。因為精液就是我們體內的生殖腺內分泌液，包括着腦下垂體，腎臟腺，睾丸腺等多種貴重的內分泌所合組而成，是無管腺，能直接由血液循環而灌溉全身，除興奮求愛情緒，主持生殖作用外，並能助長發育，調整新陳代謝，滋養腦，性，脊髓等神經。所以凡曾犯手淫遺精，早婚，或荒淫縱慾，使生殖腺內分泌液虧損者，則凡早洩，陽痿，老先發育不全，腦衰腎虧，未衰等症象即不一而足。男子至此痿弱境地，即正常的夫婦生活，恐亦感心有餘而力不足也，或竟完全不能人道，若妻子也像男子一樣慾望擴張時，能不憎恨在心，憂鬱成疾；或另尋出路，暗結私歡；或振振有詞，與夫訴請離婚之訟？這時為丈夫者心中的痛苦，為何似耶！</p>
<p>然丈夫精力衰弱，做妻子的也負有責任。丈夫的荒淫縱慾，就要施展妳的枕邊教育，勸其自愛。若不幸而已患有上述症象，尤須督促其及早治愈。好得治療之法，在今日醫學昌明之時已非難事。惟春藥及雜牌藥切不可亂服。必須服以最對症而特效的生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」則於服後一日夜間卽可生精補腎，健腦活血。連服不斷，更能助長發育，滋養神經，調整代謝，必於短期內治愈各症，使精力倍增。中老年人常服，則更延年益壽，返老還童。惟患有遺精症者，須兼服特效藥「希米胞氏固精片」以制止遺洩，則標本兼治，收效尤速。誠以上項良藥，質料名貴，功效確實。自德國發明以來已三十餘年，早已風行天下，譽滿全球，卽本埠中西五洲等大藥房及永安公司西藥部亦有出售，經服此項良藥得回復強壯而重享愛情幸福者亦不下千百萬人云。</p>
<h3>遺精失治將葬送青春</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>與其說青年期是一個黃金時代，毋甯說青年期是一個危險關頭。因為黃金時代，常不過是已呈過去的回憶，而危險關頭卻正在當前審慎地前進，前進！</p>
<p>正在春情發動期的青年，血氣方剛而理志薄弱，慾火在熱烈的衝動，惡劣環境隨時的在引誘。稍一不慎，就　入自瀆縱慾的陷阱。要知自瀆縱慾，最易　傷性神經，使精關鬆弛，所以也最易惹起遺精症。</p>
<p>精液是我們體內的生殖腺內分泌液，也就是我們生命的源泉。生命的源泉偶有一二次的遺洩，我們身體的損失已屬不貲。若一月有五六次或十餘次以上的遺洩，我們的身體怎能不大大的虧損呢？於是腦，性，脊髓等神經漸感衰弱，新陳代謝作用減退，發育作用停滯，則凡腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰痠背痛，早洩陽痿，發育不全，未老先衰等症象卽不一而足。此種青年雖終日安坐而食，已覺精力疲困，尚何能進而及時努力，及時行樂，然時間的過去，却像飛一般的快，春來不久又將歸去也！</p>
<p>少壯不努力，老大徒傷悲！遺精青年莫葬送了青春！據我們的經驗，遺精症並非為不治之症。若服以特效藥「希米脫氏固精片」則當夜即可收安眠止遺之效。因此藥係德國醫學泰斗（ProfessorSch：midt's）希米脫教授所秘製，確為鞏固精關，止遺安神之聖劑。惟因遺精已有上述症象者須兼服健壯動物生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，助長發育，連服一月，必能治愈各症，恢復美滿健康。患者若能親來本診所診治，更可保證治愈。</p>

<h3>乳峯美與生育的連繋</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>獎勵生育，鍛錬體魄，以防鄰國人口的侵略，這是現代國家主要的國策。不孝有三，無後為大，這是過去宗法社會繁榮家族的倫理觀念。總之，無論倫理觀念與現代國策，對於夫婦間的生男育女，都是認為重要而值得提倡的。雖然生男育女，和男子亦有關係，但從大部分說來，其責任女子自較男子為重。所以一個女子如果不能生育，那真是最大的缺陷，大之影響民族繁衍，小之亦破壞了夫婦間的愛情，陷入人生悲慘的境地。</p>
<p>然女性何以不能生育？這完全是生理上有了病態所致，換句話說，也就是生殖腺卵巢機能遭受月經不調，白帶不感，營養不良，心臟衰弱等症所摧殘，影响了新陳代謝作用所致。最顯明的例證，凡卵巢機能不健全者，其乳峯必然萎　，臀部瘦削，曲線毫無，面部雖有珍貴脂粉之膏沐，姿容似乎猶昔，然其生殖力則不都喪失，即或倖能生育，則此輩嬰兒之身體，亦往往脆弱得很，難期長大，終至伯道無後，遺終身之大憾！故美國百特生醫院婦科名醫魯興博士有言曰：女性一生的幸福與子女有無，祗要看她一對乳峯，如果她的乳峯高聳而有彈性者，那不但夫婦間愛情濃厚，幸福無窮，連得所生的子女，亦必康強活潑，此真經騐之謂也。由上所述，故乳峯萎靡的女性，絕對不可忽視，應積極加以挽救，挽救之法，據中西婦科名醫與余經騐。自以服生殖腺卵巢內分泌製劑女用「生殖素」，最為對症而特效。服後一日夜間即可培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經，暖宮止帶，倘繼續服用，必能在短期內使乳峯高聳，增進健美。</p>

<h3>淋毒性攝護腺炎</h3>
<p>攝護腺居內生殖器之衝要地方，患淋病而不成膀胱炎，或睾丸炎者有之，而未有不患攝護腺炎者。而攝護腺惟一所負之生殖機能，厥為分泌出一種攝護腺液，此液體必於性交時與精液同時流出，為涵養精子之要素，無精子固不能生育，但有精子無攝護腺液，同樣不能生育。因精子無攝護腺液，即不能生存故也。</p>
<p>由此觀之，淋毒性攝護腺炎，乃淋病之最易遭遇者，而且亦是最易障礙生育之症狀，故淋病患者，如果一旦續發攝護腺炎，則不可不預防破壞生殖機能，而迅速作有效之治療，始可免去不良之預後。</p>
<p>關於攝護腺炎之療法，現在因有科學上之新發見，將舊日純粹的局部療法，加以廢除，蓋純粹之舊的局部療法—局部手術的療法，不過單調的攝護腺按摩法，而不知攝護腺按摩法，絕對不能匿藏腺體內之淋菌，一一加以扑滅。故單用局部手術按摩法，從來沒有治愈攝護腺炎之事。余以最新之德國濾淋平流電療法，直接從肛門部份插入鄰攝護腺處，按照病情之輕重而施放電度，更以化學療法輔之，能短期治愈，並能保證生育。</p>

<h3>日偽統制地貨　市民生活益困苦　偽中央市場定今日開張　各地運滬貨品已遭攔截</h3>
<p>偽「中央市塲」、定於今日正式開市、對各地運滬貨物、將於今日起大肆攔截、充作該市塲之營業物此後不特增加市民之負擔、且將使各地貨行主營業損失、與地貨業之大批職工失業、茲將詳盡分誌如下、</p>
<p>偽場佈置</p>
<p>「市場」內部、經日偽僱工數十人、進行佈置、各毬設備，現已工竣，菜棚二座中、現已設有木臺數十張、以備營業之用、塲內並有運貨汽車十餘輛、以運戰所攔截之地貨物品、前為四行倉庫之大厦內、亦已打掃淸凈、作為辦公地址及堆置物品之所、至凡欲入內者、除一部份地貨商人持有該「市塲」之「黃卡」特別通行證者外、一般菜販等、均須購置兩角一張紅紙小型之「出入許可證」、方能自由出入、其無「出入許可證」及「黃卡」特別通行證者、則仍不得入內、</p>
<p>攔截地貨</p>
<p>自二十三日該「市塲」開幕後、所有由淪陷區運滬之地貨物品、即不時有被日偽攔截之事發生、據地貨商方面消息、一星期來、被日偽所攔截之地貨物品、總計不下千件以上、該「市塲」因定於今日正式營業、故昨日各地被截之地貨物品達二千餘件、聞日偽方面、圖實現共一網打盡各地運滬地貨之野心、已在蘇州河上游之曹家渡·周家橋。北站·南站。及黃浦江上游之爛泥渡·周家渡·等各處加派人員、攔截運滬地貨、强迫以低廉價格搜購、運入「中央市塲」以獨佔利益、</p>
<p>該「市塲」之開設、日方難聲稱為「減輕人民負擔」、然以其損稅之苛重、剝削之刻毒、其為榨取市民血汗、實屬昭然若揭、目下各地運滬地貨鹹臘等所捐稅金、已在二成以上、該「市塲」成立後、對已收捐稅者、尙須一律徵收佣金一威、聞其中三厘為日方所得、七厘則為「市塲」之「維持費」、聞此後本市之地貨鹹臘物品、將以日方三成以上之苛捐而再增加價格、市民之負檐、將更見加重矣</p>
<p>強取豪奪</p>
<p>開市後之偽一市塲」、除刻已將虹口吳淞路頭壩菜市塲併入外新閘橋與老閘橋之兩處地貨行亦將被强迫加入、各地貨行平日間之營業、悉有固定之買主、與固定之客家、可賺其固定之佣金、但加入偽「市塲」後、一切均受該「塲」限止、絕無自由營業可言、祇可向該「塲」於拍板交易時批發貨物、以維生計、故本可賺得之佣金、亦祇能獲得極少數」部、因其大部將分派於日偽也、且設如不加入該「塲」、則將無處獲得貨物、故目下各加入該「塲」之地貨行主、莫不叫苦連天、至新閘與老閘橋之地貨行營業、雖一時不至全栘至偽「市塲」但在日偽覬覦之下、該處恐難免入其彀中、果爾、則上述兩處市塲、勢將改觀、現聞一部份設在該處之地貨行、已有將房屋出租者、</p>
<p>失業堪虞</p>
<p>各地貨行所僱之職工、每家有多至五六十名者，最少亦有七八名、全市總計有二千餘名、若輩平時薪水低微、在此生活程度高漲時、本已難於維持、據該業某職工言、偽「市塲」成立後、各地貨行若併入該處、全部僅需職員五六十人、工人三十餘名、且早經日偽僱就、故目下一部職工、已頗感失業之恐慌、惟依據該業之慣例、辭退職工之時日、尙須遲至端節也、</p>
<h3>西貢米價跌一成　洋米大批出棧　豆米業雜糧業兩公會　主張募款繼續辦平糶</h3>
<p>本市民食調節協會、日來為籌集　款出淸宿貨事、　數度開會討論、情形頗為熱烈、現悉自該會主席虞洽卿認借五萬元、常務理事郭順認借六萬元後、其他委員均盡力之所能、極力向各方認借、又自該會於上月二十七日召開司庫聯席會議議決後、復將一部洋米向金城銀行押款十五萬元、故所需要之百餘萬元　款、籌集之數、已超過半數以上、如此日內可有大批存棧洋米、陸續提出、又據西貢電訊、該地米價較之上週、又跌落百分之十、雖中日兩國紛向購買、仍有看跌之趨勢、因之本埠米價、將逐日下跌、</p>
<p>恐慌未除</p>
<p>上海市豆米行業暨雜糧油餅業兩公會昨函上海平糶委員會稱、自本年一月下句開辦平糶以來、貧民受惠、常非淺尠、試覜各平糶處、每處每日、肩　踵接、佇立以購者何止千百人、其需求之急迫可知、殊足見平糶之應繼續辦理亦明甚、顧平糶之虧損、勢必與日俱增、而籌集之款、至目前為止、計僅七十餘萬元、轉瞬即將吿罄、因有四月七日以後暫行結束之議、敝會等以為米價及各種物價猶未平落、而春熟收穫為期尙遠、貧民生活恐慌迄未解除、</p>
<p>仍待救濟</p>
<p>其有待於救濟、仍極殷切、若驟於此時、停辦平糶、竊期期以為未可、為再備函陳請貴委員會、迅予再度召集全滬各公團、無論前已認捐者、或未認捐者、作第二次之擴大勸募運動、集成巨款、繼續舉辦、敝會等同業、仍願忝附驥尾、勉竭輸將、</p>
<p>麻袋跌價</p>
<p>本市為工商各業進出頻繁之大埠、故包裝貨物之麻袋、需用甚鉅、但去歲自歐戰發生後、因麻袋之大宗來源、為印度加兩各答、運輸水脚大漲、故麻袋價格、亦隨之上漲、戰　每只僅售一角左有者、戰後即上漲五六倍、每只需二元左右、但自今春本市米商訂購百餘萬包之洋米來滬後、因是項洋米、均用麻袋盛裝、故本市驟增大批麻袋、麻袋價格、亦隨之下降、每只僅售一元二三角、</p>
<p>產銷合作</p>
<p>本市各米業團體、因需籌商米糧產消合作組織將於今日下午二時、假愛多亞路荳米業公會召集各米業團體、舉行聯席會議、聞參加者為荳米業·米行業。米號業。碾米業·經售業·等各團體、又米行業茶會市塲、福州每石米價、高達九十七元、該同鄕會派人至米行業茶會市塲接洽購買洋米、車關救濟事業、市塲特發臨時入塲證一紙、期限為一月、</p>

<p>義泰興等各煤號撥售平價煤屑一千噸、由小型球廠按照規定數量、自四月一日起、至十日止、向各煤棧以法幣一次購置、照每噸一百元價格計算、到棧自車、不發棧單、如過四月十日之期、即作為放棄、至購去煤屑、不得轉賣、必須製造煤球、供應市銷、</p>
<p>廿二球廠購買平煤</p>

<p>函三煤號三次平賣</p>
<p>上海市煤業同業公會昨分函義泰興、華中。元泰等三煤公司、望其繼續嘉惠平民、第三次供給平價鴻基煤屑於熟水業同業公會各會員、聞該　煤公司均表示贊同、於可能範圍內予以照辦、至於第二次平價熟水店煤屑、業於昨日上午十二時截止、共計一週內售出平煤約達五百噸左右、</p>
<h3>兩租界當局　昨晨撤銷戒備　商團及駐軍均恢復原防　仍採普通戒備嚴禁集會</h3>
<p>兩租界警務當局、因前日為南京「新政權」成立日期、恐反動份子泥入租界、搗亂秩序、故實施特別緊急戒備、出動萬國商團·各國駐滬防軍、封鎖不必要馬路橋梁、因處置有方、故局、因此特於昨晨六時、將封鎖馬路橋樑之鐵絲網、一律撤除、商團及各國駐軍、一律恢復原防、所有前日縮短行程之十六路十八路無軌電車、亦依照原綫路行駛、雖經取消特別戒備、惟仍施行普通戒備、未經核准之集會遊行示威等活動、均在禁止之例、而南市·閘北·浦東·虹口·滬西。各區之日偽軍、亦較平日為嚴、濫施搜查、蓋恐愛國份子混入活動也、</p>

<h3>日設「工商業發展公司」　囊括長江貿易　經營沿江實業匯兌　開放諾言置諸腦後　又以開放珠江餌第三國</h3>
<p>據法文上海日報載、據日方消息、東　方面、近父成　一揚子江工商業發展公司一、其經營目標、為長江各地之實　滙兌、乃至於金融等等、均在其囊括之內、現悉該公司已獲得「興亞院之特許、即將派經濟部長鈴木來滬、籌備設立分公司、並設立所　中日委昌會」、藉以討論一切進行事宜、按關於長江之開放　　、前據日方傳聞、會有一　　　「新政權」成立時、即可成為事實之說、但近據日外　省發言人須　之談話、則　說又並不可靠、今則又設立「揚子江工商業發展公司」、日方顯然一有獨佔長江貿易之決心、其所謂開故之說、恐終將無　實現</p>
<p>日方又傳開放珠江</p>
<p>又據　　　傳來消息、現為日軍封鎖之珠江、日方又　將於本月　全部開　、開放以後、廣州香港間、將按日　汽船行駛、目下香港方面有某西人之私有船隻佛山號、於　星斯四之　、行駛廣州一决、　日由廣州開回、該船行駛時、關於載運貨物、頗受限　、　居住沙面之外僑所需要之食　　、其餘一概禁止運載、有一日商船隻、每星期往返香港廣州二决、載客運貨、均不受限制</p>
<p>廣州堆藏大量日貨</p>
<p>據稱珠江全部開放後、將有英商之船隻行駛其間、對於珠江將重行開放之消息、港地外商、對之均表示漠然、蓋日方所謂尤許外商行駛船隻、並非即尤許外商自由經營商業之意、在過去八個月內、日人已在廣州堆藏大宗日貨、其數量足以完全排斥英美之商品有餘、此等貨物、皆由日方之商船戰艦從日本直接運來、而為完全不繳納關稅者、此外復有重開廣州商埠之說、此訊之傳出、為廣州海關新近指定日人七員為海關內勤人昌所致、但無從證實其是否可靠、</p>
<h3>上海扒手素描</h3>
<p>— 百敏</p>
<p>手段高妙不可思議</p>
<p>七海的扒手黨，組織完善，竊取市民財物，年達數萬元，公共租界警務當局正在設法撲滅這種罪惡。至於直接遭受損失的公衆，對於這事，從有方範，也是很徵的。扒手黨止像本市其他竊賊一樣，黨徒眾多，手段高妙，不常　失風。</p>
<p>好像學生又似商人</p>
<p>他們常是　人三人或四人結伴行竊。扒手在英美有個職　上的渾名，叫做「Cannons」。上海的扒手，也有「一隻手」等綽號。有時扒手看　好像一學生，有時儼然殷實商人，有時酷似街頭常見的寫午間傭僕。他們常在人叢中橫闖直衝地擠軋，在公共汽車站上；尤其是河南路站上，許多人擁上車去，也像眞是乘客的爭先恐後，但扒手故意擠軋，好讓同黨乘機下手的也很多。</p>
<p>本領高強方法很多</p>
<p>市民落入扒手的圈套，方法繁多，有時旁人踏着他的足趾，或是他的帽子「偶然被撞落，只得灣腰拾取，那麽，扒手便乘　竊取銀錢或自來墨水筆。扒手還常故意撞及某人，立　達聲陪罪，一刹那間，站在　撞人後面的扒手便大施竊術了。公共汽車和電車，是扒手們時常光臨之處。南京路以北的西川路，雖祇短短的段，但警務處專捕扒手的警員，對於這段路特別注意。</p>
<p>重要文件原璧歸趙</p>
<p>上海的扒手，有一點和世界各地的「同業」相同，這便是竊得皮夾中的有價値文件和函件，一槪原璧歸趙。他們常用的方法，是將這些文件納入信封，不書地址，投入信箱，讓郵政當局交給警務處</p>
<p>利用刀片割破衣服</p>
<p>有些扒手，利用鑲在木片中的剃刀片，夾在左手兩指間，在公共汽車或電車內，乘客擁擠的時候，割破乘客長袍，甚至腰帶來竊錢，非常敏疾。被竊的人每每回到家裏，才發覺失竊了。利用報紙遮斷被竊者的視綫，也是行竊的老方法；而且大都成功。扒手用報紙掩手，只須一秒鐘，便可竊得掛在西服外面袋口上的自來墨水筆。有時扒手的手段稍慢，來不及將竊得的筆藏掉，便拋在地，踢到人行道，那裏早有另一扒手在等着拾起。如巢失筆者已注意到鋼筆被竊，那末，拾起鋼筆的扒手，便將筆奉還原主，常得原主的道謝。</p>
<p>臂掛大衣假裝瞎子</p>
<p>讀者還該注意左臂掛大衣的人，因為在擁擠時，他會利用大衣，掩沒他的右手，伸入你口袋裏竊物。用細巧錶練掛着的錶，很容易被老資格的扒手用特殊方法，扭斷錶練，將錶竊去。攝影機也容易被竊。假使看見一個瞎子沿馬路前行，你得盡力帮助他穿過危險的十字路口，可是你得記着「瞎子」不是全都失明的，所以有些「瞎子」撞人，祇是乘機竊取口袋裏的東西。美國水兵常遇到假充「報販」的扒手，他們將報紙伸到美水兵的面前，利用這倐忽之間，竊取美水兵制服左胸口袋裏的東西。</p>
<p>婦女扒手手段更妙</p>
<p>在上海，扒手黨中很少是婦女，在英美却很多，而且手段比男子更高妙，可是，扒手每年雖竊得價値數萬元的財物，即使剛偷到大批財物，他本人得到的，還是不多，因為他們同行中，也有脅詐錢財情事。例如扒手黨若竊得大宗財物，還得分一些給互相競爭的扒手黨，以免走漏風聲。</p>
<p>疑心失竊不必聲張</p>
<p>若要免得自已財物遭這些罪犯竊去，務須隨時留意。你若乘公共車輛時，疑心失竊，不必聲張，只須走到售票員前面吿訴他，他便會緊閉車門，直到召呼巡捕上車。</p>
<p>當心扒手注意六點</p>
<p>還有幾點，也須　　：（一）切弗將攝影機　提袋掛在肩頭，因為剃刀片可以立刻割斷皮帶。（二）留心將報紙伸到你面前的人。（三）切弗在西裝袴後面右袋裏放東西，因為這是最容易被竊的。（四）若不願自來墨水筆和鉛筆遺失，最好把它們放在裏面口袋中。（五）注意撞你而向你　聲道歉的人。（六）最後你若疑心失竊，切記報告巡捕。</p>

<h3>人工消化蛋白質構成之原理</h3>
<p>吾人營養之要素。不外脂肪。蛋白質。小粉質。灰分。維他命五種。其中蛋白質小粉。脂肪。是燃燒的質料。熱的根本。力的源泉。尤以蛋白質一種。更有其他重大使命。然人體的組織。如肌肉血液。臟器。大部分是由蛋白質構成。是以對其成長發達。需蛋白質充分洪給。即經長成發達。每日亦必有蛋白質數十克的消耗。此種消耗的補充。自非另行吸收。無以維持生命。然而蛋白質的構造。非常複雜。而且蛋白質本身直接不能發生營養效力。人體如欲利用蛋白質以供營養。必須經胃。膵。小腸的酵素。經幾番的消化工作。由複雜的物質。分解為單純物質。與血液共同循還。始吸收於組織。以供燃燒。製血造肌。而此項供給單純物質。卽所謂蛋白消化終產物。在學術上名曰「阿密那酸」含蛋白質最多之牛乳鷄子等。雖日服數斤有不見營養之功者。實緣牛乳鷄子須經腸胃消化。始能變為人身所需之蛋白質。體虎胃弱者。決不能消化吸收。而變為人身所需之蛋白質。人工蛋白質乃用牛乳　子等蛋白質。按照吾人消化作用之方法。經過種種化學的操作。完全變為人工消化蛋白質『阿密那酸』服下之後。無須經腸胃消化卽可與人體組織同化吸收。直接造血肥肌。滋麥四肢百體。雖服少量。亦可鼓動細胞。以促進新陳代謝作用。而使全身精神煥發。增進消化液的分泌。以助食物消化。而使體內組織吸收。促進發育。及增進疾病抵抗力。腦力。生長。活動。生殖機能等。故凡精力衰退。及息肺結核病。因結核毒質作用全身發熱。體內蛋白質必被分解破壞。有本品補充。更為肺病要藥。『龜齡片』卽以此人工蛋白質為主要成分。</p>
<h3>龜齡片之特長</h3>
<p>龜齡片為內分泌腺及人工消化蛋白質。活性酵素等有效份所製成。內含多景青春動物。『荷爾蒙』刺激素。有增強生殖機能。旺盛發育。及直接補益身體所缺重要成份蛋白質之效力。故凡年老體衰者服之可恢復靑春生殖機能。體力益强。靑年腎虧體弱者服之塡精益髓。可退還靑春壯盛之一日。效騐宏大。應靈異常。超過一般滋補劑。不啻千百倍。實有益而無害之聖藥。服一盒食慾增强。病魔潛蹤。元氣大振。服一月體壯精足。作事不倦。連服數月。雖衰老無能者。亦可恢復靑春時代之體力精神。誠藥中聖品也。</p>
<h3>龜齡片主治各症</h3>
<p>腦神經衰弱。生殖力减退。性欲減退，發育不全。陽痿早泄。盜汗遺精。手淫斵傷。勃起力减退。快味缺乏。子嗣艱難。老年衰弱。少年早老。髮白齒搖。耳聾目眩。精力疲憊。腰腿酸軟。視力减退。讀書善忘。癆傷吐血。肺結核咳嗽。發燒贏瘦。及消化器病。食慾減退。營養不良。心臟衰弱。貧血不眠。糖尿病。脚氣病。病後恢復。兒實發育不足。及女子胎前產後衰弱。經血病不孕病。均有特效。</p>

<p>異聞彙誌</p>
<p>（一）蘇州於前月二十一日傍晚，落日將墜，疎星微明，仰望雲霄，忽有黑氣一道，自南跨北，似雲非雲，似烟非烟，有若雨後長虹，橫亘空際。越一炊黍時許，乃更乘風南向，勢如箭射而沒。（二）蘇　內桃花塢西街某姓豆腐舖，每日需用水漿，多由隔宵汲取，盛滿於舖中。舊有水缸三隻，大俱可容十石。五月初旬，該舖晨起推磨取水，忽見缸底涸然，初疑舖夥懶惰，不以為怪，不料如是十餘日，皆不留點滴。由是店主約其同行及隣里數人，秉燭守候，以觀其異。至三更時分，果有一物，蜿蜒缸口，初則細若蚯蚓，巳乃如椽如柱，轉瞬之間，粗逾數抱，鱗甲斑斕，色發金赤，形若巨蟒，無首無尾。眾人望見，驚詫喧嘩，其怪蟠據不動，未幾，缸中水涸，怪亦遂沒。不知所來，亦不知所往，起缸視之，並無穴孔。店主懼其相擾，即日挈家遷徙云。（三）離周浦鎮三里之一小鎮，名一粒珠。緣該鎮市心有大墳一座，高約數丈，可望十里，如珠之圓，鎮由是得名。昨日忽黑雲密佈，隱約中見有烏龍四條，白龍二條，由南而北，風勢甚大，吹倒房屋五十餘間，一時鷄鳴犬吠，鵲亂鴉飛，居民各自逃生。被壓傷者計三四十人。後黑雲四散，大雨傾盆，又有紅光，閃閃不絕，至五點鐘始止。</p>

<h3>春假與旅行影呆</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>春天是旅行的季節，尤其是在春假之中，都市裏的人們，旅行的興趣挺是濃厚。爲的春大，就是不去遊覽名山大川，祇要走到郊外，就可看到春光明媚中，桃紅柳綠菜花黃，眞够使人沉醉。何况春假的假期比較可算長些，可使你抽出閒來去遠遊一次。道原因，春假好像是專爲人們去遊春而放的，凡是可能的話，又有誰願辜負春光呢！</p>
<p>的確，在我以爲旅行是人生的最大快事，任何娛樂比不上旅行能使人發生快感。看電影，聽京戲，這些娛樂是太俗氣了，惟有旅行，到了一處名勝的地方，空氣的新鮮，風景的美妙，會使人有一種新的刺激，不由自主的留戀着；而且你有時沒有車子或轎子可通，祇有步行，使你爬山越嶺，得到一個運動的機會。要是一個學者或是靑年學生，那爲了旅行，更可增進不少關於史地和自然科學的常識，益處很多呢！</p>
<p>愛好藝術的人，旅行當然更見感到趣味，一個作家，出去旅行一次，會寫幾篇遊記；一個詩人，在旅行途中，見山川人物，隨處可我到詩料，甚至會對着大自然不自覺的吟起詩來；一個畫家，出去旅行，總不會忘記帶着畫具，看到可愛的風景，馬上會寫生；尤其愛好攝影的人，帶了照相機，到處可把美麗的景物攝入鏡頭；帶回家裏都可作爲旅行的紀念。</p>
<p>如今的上海，已成「孤島」，就是在春假裏，除了遊公園之外，不能出外去旅行。但事實吿訴我們，近年來上海的人們，對於旅行已發生了濃厚的興趣。往年吧，尤其是在此春假期內，準會有不少男女離開上海到蘇，杭，寗，鍚等勝地去旅行。滬杭，京滬兩綫的火車，每班擠軋非凡，大有容納不下之概。而幾個旅行社發起的團體旅行，會有幾百乃至上千的男女，大隊人馬，到各地去旅行，大家要去鑒賞大自然的美麗，興趣的濃厚，即此也可見一斑了。</p>
<h3>「衣」在化學上的除垢法</h3>
<p>— 新</p>
<p>一件簇新的衣服，在一萬决的小心切意中偶而遇到了一次的疏忽，着了油或是染了墨水，血跡，这是根本不及預防的意外，也是人所不能免的常事。到洗衣店去吧！價錢實在太貴，因此處置此項所染的油汚，惟有直接求之於用化學藥品來洗滌的一法了。</p>
<p>如果染上的是油跡，祇須用揮發油（俗稱汽油）略略搽擦，即褪。染的是墨水，可塗以醋酸，或將酒石酸溶於適度的淸水，譯和敷上後，再把氨水塗上，如此相互搽塗的至五六次，墨水即褪；如遇紅墨水，宜用酒精和醋酸的混合液方可擦去。染了墨跡，可用飯粒慢慢地揉搓，再以油脂酸塗上，汚跡即褪。染了血跡，亦可用石鹼除去，如果血液異常濃厚，需先浸以蘇打水，再以食鹽溶液塗楂，最後再移入鹹水，血液即可完全褪去，惟最要注意者，溫水的熱度，能使血液中的蛋白質牢黏於纖維質上，故切忌用溫小漂先。</p>
<h3>節省煤球法社</h3>
<p>— 社</p>
<p>煤球是上海人每日所必需的燃料，它的價格本來是很賤的，記得是廿六年春天吧，那時上海煤球還不過一塊錢一擔，而且是第一號的貨色。但是自中日戰事發生後，這孤島上的生活程度日益提高，百物飛漲，煤球當然不能例外，於是自每担一元的價格，而漲到兩元，三元，四元……直至七元多，雖說近日實行平賣，然每担價格仍須五元八角之巨，我們雖不能推測今後的趨勢是漲是跌，但這樣大的價格，確乎已是空前了！在這種高壓下勉力生活着的上海人，一方面當然希望租界當局能努力地抑平物價，另一方面亦惟有自己力事節省，以求减少一點支出，現在我們就來談這個節省煤球的辦法吧。</p>
<p>我覺得把煤爐一天生到晚，太不經濟，因為在飯後的這幾點鐘中（約自一時至五時），除了煮點開水外，燦爐簡直是不需要的，旣不需要，便怎麼辦呢？把它熄了罷，那到燒晚飯時又要重新生起來，太覺麻煩了，生着嫌浪費，熄了又麻煩，究竟怎樣好呢？這種便有一個折衷的辦法了—把煤爐封口，便是把那煤爐裏倒出來的燒過了的煤球，這種煤球外面已成了紅色，但是中心仍有點黑色，便取這黑的加水打細，再稍稍加點紅色的灰，把它調和成漿狀，當飯後要封口的時候，便把燦爐內煤球加足，在沿面把這漿狀物放上一層，中心打一個洞通氣，這樣煤爐便不會熄滅，而且上面仍可放上一壺水，待到要開封時，只須把煤爐打通，加些煤球，一扇便行，這是一個極簡單而又經濟的法子，不然的話，一下午至少要加上二三决煤球，即以價値一角計，一月亦要三槐多錢，假使來這樣實行的話，這三塊錢不是便可省下來了嗎？諸位如其尙不知此法，何妨便來試試看呢！</p>
<p>納喜與威立斯　大名車合展靜安寺路一四六〇號人通汽車公司，今年起除經理納喜汽車外，同時經理威立斯汽車。按納喜旣富麗，父經濟，分八汽缸車及六汽缸車兩種；威立斯係叫汽缸車，定價最廉，用油極省，並爲各該同價車類中之翹楚。頃聞以上兩大名車，現正同在大通樣子間展覽，歡迎各界參觀。</p>
<h3>損失了一部活的萬寳全書　悼念本刋特約撰述天虛我生陳栩園先生</h3>
<p>— 周瘦鵑</p>
<p>三月二十四日一個細雨濛濛的朝晨，彷彿天公正在灑淚，灰黯的天空，壓得低低的，滿現着一派凄凉的氣象。愛麥虞限路金谷邨的一角小樓上，躺着一位奄奄一息的蒼髯老人；燒殘的爐香，憔悴的瓶花，愁眉百結的家人，正相對無言的陪伴着他。他老人家一淸早醒回來，就對他的愛子愛女說：「今天十點鐘我要去了；此刻再讓我好好地睡一會。」於是閉上了眼睛，慢慢地睡了過去。子女們聽了他「要去」的話，心中傷感得說不出話來，只是目不轉睛的呆望着老父，小樓中靜悄悄地一些兒聲音都沒有，連雕籠中的一頭芙蓉鳥也靜默了。這樣不知經過了多少時候，猛聽得壁上的掛鐘鏜鏜地打了十下，打破了小樓中沉靜的空氣，直打到子女們的心坎上，而床上的老父只微吐了一口氣，就此寂然，子女們搶上前去喊着哭着，早已不及，只聞到老父口中微微地吐出一陣伽南香，呼吸就道樣斷了。在這一剎那間，這一位文學界和實業界的巨人天虛我生陳栩園先生，竟悄悄地走出了五濁惡世，結束了他六十二年辛動奮鬬百折不回的歷史。不但是他的一家，受了一個極大的損失，社會和國家，也受了一個極大的損失；就是和他老人家有二十餘年深交的筆者，也覺得受了一個極大的損失—損失了一部活的萬寳全書！</p>
<p>陳先生是一個文人，然而並不是一個讀死書的文人；他有經驗，有識見，有才智，有氣魄，有新思想，有創造力，並且也懂世故，懂人情，他實在是一位多方面的學者，値得做我們一般文人的導師的。他的一生，也有些像俄國文豪高爾基氏，在失敗的洪爐中翻來覆去，經過了千錘百鍊，終於造成了他理想中的事業。他曾做過敎師，小商人，公司老闆，官署幕僚，代理縣令，也辦過雜誌和小報，民國三年，也會主編過申報副刊自由談，因自由談而編成一部行銷百餘萬的家庭常識，因家庭常識而發明了擦面牙粉，手創家庭工業社，打倒舶來牙粉，替國家挽回不少的利權。此後又製造其他各種化妝品，造酒，造藥，造紙，造汽水果汁，造藥沫滅火機，都有相當的成績。他不想到一件事便罷，一想到了，就得埋頭苦幹，定要一一實現起來。至於文學方面，他能文，能詩，能塡詞，能製曲，能寫小說，他在實業界雖創下了一手事業，但仍不廢文事，天天以文事爲消遣。他的學識是太豐富了，上自天文地理，下至三敎九流，幾於無所不知。他並沒有讀過英文，學過化學，然而和你講起化學來，滔滔如瀉瓶水，比了化學家還要淵博。他健於談，很歡迎人家去和他談天，有將一切疑難問題去請敎他的，他知無不言，言無不盡，像他那樣的啟迪後進，不憚煩瑣，眞能使人感動。即如筆者每逢百無聊賴時，也總得去訪問他一下，和他談詩文，談詞曲，談哲理，談一切常識，因此而得益不少；他老人家雖以老友相待，而我却當他是我的老師，是我的一部活的萬寳全書。</p>
<p>三年以前，次子榕墮池而死，我傷心已極，先生以長歌相慰，並拈「譬如昨日死」五字囑我時時唸着，以自譬解。從此我每遇不如意事，往往默唸這五個字，果然得到不少的安慰。八一三事變爆發，筆者離鄉出走，想起了西子湖上的先生，曾以一詩寄呈；「君家西子原幽秀，我有天平亦足誇，誰料一經離亂後，山殘水剩兩無家。」唉！剩水殘山，欲歸小得，先生竟這樣悄悄的去了，九泉之下，怕也不能甘心吧。</p>
<p>二十六日的早上，帶了一個花圈，趕往世界殯儀館去憑弔，心中只是一陣陣的酸，四肢都沒有了氣力，掙扎着走進靈幃，見他老人家最後的一面，我的眼淚早像雨一般滾下來了，和苦塊中的蝶野相抱痛哭，再也小能自制。唉，先生，我生平傷心之淚，以前只有三副，三十九年前哭父，十六年前哭兄，三年前哭子，這是第四副傷心之淚，今天就至至誠誠地獻給你老人家了</p>
<p>先生的聲音笑貌，老是不能忘懷，每溯，止小住要心酸；至於先生的嘉言懿行，也不是這篇短文所能概括，姑借新擬的一副輓聯來作一結束：</p>
<p>大業自煌煌，異能突過公輸子。</p>
<p>中原仍擾擾，遺憾同深陸放翁。</p>
<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>金花菜本名苴蓿，俗稱草頭，也是菜蔬中比較便宜的一種。杭州出產的不及本地產的軟糯，因爲梗子太長太硬的原故。素的做法，很爲簡單，只須將豆腐乾切成條子，一同生炒就得了；不過這東西很吃油，所以油要放得多些。至於葷的做法，以與較肥的猪肉合在一起，最爲相宜；先將肉切成大塊子，入鍋紅燜，燜得爛了，然後將金花菜生炒，墊在肉底，肉油滲透了，吃起來很爲腴美。倘將猪肉和金花菜同燜，原無不可，不過色彩就差一些，所以最好猪肉自管紅燜，金花菜自管生炒，那麼紅綠相映，看在眼裏，也能增加你的食慾。</p>

<h3>我們的兒童讀物呢？</h3>
<p>— 導鴻</p>
<p>最近本刊上對兒童的體罰問題，有一再的詞論，我認為這是一個很好的現像，我要為兒童們慶幸。兒童的體格固然值得我們注意，但兒童的精神食糧—兒童讀物問題，却也是非常重要的。我想就這點說幾句話。</p>
<p>我們不能否認，富有滋　料的兒童讀物，一向是很少的。戰前即使有人不斷的喊着增加兒童讀物的口號，而成績也不能令人滿意。致於戰後的情形，就如今日的上海言，兒童讀物的貧乏，可說是到了空前絕後的地步。—但願是絕後的。上海的文化界，戰後雖不如戰前那樣的蓬勃，但目前報攤上可看的舊報雜誌，還不算少。然而兒童讀物呢？我們看到一本嗎？從前的「小朋友」「小學生」「新少年」「兒童雜誌」「兒童畫報」是早已停刊了，而後起的一種也沒有。我有一個親戚，一向對兒童教育是很注意的。近來他因為買不到孩子們可讀的讀物，便將我家從前弟弟讀的小朋友及兒童畫報借去給孩子們看。如果有人說：兒童讀物沒有生意，所以沒有出版家願意出版，作為上海兒童讀物貧乏的　由，恐也未必盡然吧。</p>
<p>目前不但沒有一本真正的兒童讀物，連提倡的人也沒有了。從前許多報章雜誌上很熱鬧很認真地討論過兒童讀物的問題，但現在這個問題是不再提及，好像被人們忘記了。我應該說，兒童也隨着國家走着厄運呢！</p>
<p>兒童讀物的重要，是無須我說的。某外國教育家說：一個國家的教育發達與否，從它良好的兒童讀物的多少上，是可以概見的。從這句話，我們可以想見兒童讀物的重要了。</p>
<p>因為兒童讀物的缺乏，結果是擠着兒童向舊書攤上跑。而書攤上的舊小說及連環圖畫，不但沒有滋　料，而且含有毒質。兒童純潔的腦筋裏，染上了這些荒誕無稽的神怪思想，其為害實不堪設想。好像有人曾主張把這些書統統燒光，這辦法我到贊成；但我們不拿新的讀物來代替補充，我想即使真的燒起來，恐怕也要有野草燒不盡之感呢。這些舊小說的勢力，實大得可怕；據說從前蘇州專門印舊小說的各書店，每年所印的數量，較商務·世界·中華合起來每年所印各書的數量還大。現在上海新的兒童讀物旣然沒有，則更是舊小說擴充勢力的機會了。</p>
<p>我懇切的希望上海的著作界出版界，把一部分眼光移到兒童讀物上面，替我們苦難的孩子造一點福。</p>
<h3>「工頭制」的利弊</h3>
<p>— 逸鵬</p>
<p>讀了福新麵粉工人械鬥的新聞後，我想到一個「題外」的問題，就是「工頭制」的應否存在。</p>
<p>所謂「工頭制」者工人與資方並不直接發生關係，一切責任由居間者，的工頭負責之。這對於小規模的廠家，確是一種便利的制度，因為小廠家出品不多，且工作時有時無，資方不能常期雇用工人，有了工頭居間介紹，就可有工作時由工頭去召集工人，於時間經濟上兩全其美。但是問題就發生在這裏，現在失業者的衆多是無可諱言的事實，大家想爭奪飯碗，對於這有生殺之權的工頭，自然得曲意服從，於是工頭之剝削，不一而足，如「孝敬」「抽成」等使工人勞力所得者耗其大半，而工頭則坐享其利。在生活程度日高的現在，物品的交易都在倡議消費合作社，避免居間者的漁利，而以勞力來博取生活費的工人反而遭到工頭的剝削，這實在是種不良的制度。同時，在一般較大的廠家，間接也蒙受許多「工頭制」的無形損失：因為工頭旣以工人的「孝敬」為選擇標準，他所召集來的工人工作效能如何，自然是談不到了，而浪費原料，損害機器等再無形中都使廠方受到損失。所以，小型工廠或許事實上不可能暫時採用「工頭制」，一般較大的工廠為求出品的精良，迅速，及避免一切無形損失，都以採用「工頭制」為宜，而工人方面，也可得到較厚的工資而安心工作，這不但是雙方有利，同時可以避免因工頭的剝削而發生的糾紛。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第廿二回　新聞要訉天外飛來　崇議宏論人間信仰</p>
<p>吳君素：從前中國人有句老話，叫做「秀才不出門，能知天下事。」這是說讀書的知識廣博，通曉一切而已。現在我們可以把秀才兩字改去，改為「記者不出門，能知天下事。」當新聞記者的，安坐斗室之中，全世界的消息，都會到你手中。這不但是使你知識廣博，也是受—科學之賜了吧？瞿　雙笑道：「新聞事　發達以後，新聞不是從大門裏走進來的，却是從屋頂上飛進來，以前就有那樣一句笑話。現在的新聞，的確都不是從大門來的，而是從屋頂來的。自從　　發明以來，真如君素姊　的世界大事，全可集納於斗室之中。而且此刻不但是電傳語言文字，還可以電傳照相。譬如數千里外的一個地方，今天在那裏開會，我們憑了這個電傳照相，鑄了銅板，明晨就可以見諸報上咧。」她們　　　，　走，却見編輯室的大廣間傍邊，另有幾間小室。望進去，却很　靜雅，周圍一帶，都是玻璃書櫥。不過此刻也很少有人在那裏。瞿無雙道：「這幾間是撰述室，因為　　編輯室覺得太鬧了，　以安排這幾間室了，給撰述評　的人，安心寫作的，現在報館裏的趨勢，對於論文，　該當場　揮。譬如半夜裏來了一條重要新聞，半夜裏就要發揮一篇論說，指示大家一條路徑。至於　說的長短倒不在乎，或者那一條新聞來得太遲了，來不及長篇大論的　抒，那末短峭簡練的評論，總要有一則。要知道報紙是　表輿論，不是　　報告新聞，做一種傳聲筒罷了。要立論精嚴，　評公尤，方能主持言論界的　　。記得從前有　　怕事的報紙，全部沒有一點論評，即使有　評，也講些不相干的事。這種報紙，都是逃　現實的報紙，畏首畏尾，身其有幾。那種報紙，在戰前中國看報的人程度　淺，也許可以行銷。若到此刻，早已沒有人去看它的了。所以我們　裏的幾位撰述　說的先生，都是目光如炬，深明政治，經濟，社會科學的人。一篇　手，萬姓爭觀，至少每一件事，使人就有一種　本智識。方見得報紙的價值，報紙的權　，假如　一百萬讀者的話，就可以得到一百萬讀者的信仰了。」</p>

<h3>U.S. Government Issues Declaration: Absolutely Will Not Recognize the Nanjing Puppet Regime; Affirms that the Only Legitimate Government of China is in Chongqing; the United States Will Always Maintain All the Rights It Should Enjoy</h3>
<p>Secretary of State Hull of Washington recently issued a declaration today, stating that the U.S. government still recognizes the National Government of China in Chongqing as the country's only legitimate government. As for the "new regime" established by Wang Jingwei in Nanjing, it is considered to be of the same nature as the regimes established by a certain foreign country in China in the past, and its goal is only to benefit the interests of that foreign country. The main points of the declaration are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Secretary of State Hull first stated that the United States still recognizes the National Government of China in Chongqing as the only legitimate government. The U.S. attitude towards the use of force to pursue national policy has been repeatedly and decisively stated, and should be well known to the world. The U.S. government specifically reiterates that the U.S. will fully reserve all rights enjoyed under international law and existing treaties and agreements. As for the "Nanjing New Regime," we believe, with reference to similar events that have occurred in some other parts of China since 1931, that the establishment of this "New Regime" is a further action by a certain country to force its neighbor to accept its will. Its goal is to prevent a vast country from maintaining normal political and economic relations with the rest of the world. In short, a certain country has repeatedly resolved to establish several new regimes under its patronage within China. The task of these new regimes is to facilitate the interests of that country itself, and to refuse to allow the nationals of the United States and other countries to enjoy the long-standing equal and public treatment. The incident that occurred in Nanjing this time is a copy of this established new regime story. Moreover, senior officials of a certain country have repeatedly issued declarations stating that the country is prepared to respect the political independence and freedom of its neighbors, and that this intention should be expressed by facts. The U.S. government has filed this declaration, but looking at the military and diplomatic situation at the time of the establishment of the "Nanjing New Regime," it seems to be completely inconsistent with this intention. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Secretary of State Hull of Washington issued a statement yesterday, denouncing those who steal the political sovereignty of the people and aggressors, and declaring that the United States will never recognize the "Nanjing Kuomintang" and Wang Jingwei's "Nanjing Government." Hull spoke on the day the "Nanjing Government" was established, saying, "The United States must still recognize the Chongqing government and the Chinese government. That government still has the support and backing of the people." He further stated that the establishment of the "Wang Jingwei government" is clearly "another step in a certain country's process of violently plundering neighboring countries and attempting to completely sever a large part of the world's land from external political and economic relations." Therefore, the "Nanjing New Government" is no different from other "new regimes" in China, which are exploited by a certain foreign force and deny the legitimate rights and public interests long established by the people of the United States and third countries. The U.S. government has taken note of the remarks made by senior officials of a certain country, stating that the country respects the political sovereignty and freedom of its neighbors and will implement this intention as the situation in East Asia gradually develops. However, whether from a military or diplomatic perspective, the establishment of the "New Nanjing Government" does not seem to be consistent with this intention. The U.S. attitude towards not recognizing the use of force as a country's policy is self-evident. The U.S. attitude and position on the situation in the Far East have also been repeatedly clarified, and this attitude has never changed. The United States still maintains its right to safeguard international law and existing treaties. The U.S. government unanimously recognized the National Government of the Republic of China with other countries twelve years ago. The U.S. government is convinced that the capital of the Chinese government is in Chongqing, and has protected and will continue to protect the support of the people of that country. Therefore, the U.S. government has always recognized the National Government as the only legitimate government of China." (United Press dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>After Secretary of State Hull of Washington issued a declaration yesterday, stating that the United States still recognizes the National Government of China as the only legitimate government, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman also spoke to the press in support, strongly asserting that the United States will never recognize the "Nanjing Wang Jingwei Government." He also stated that Japan's violation of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty remains the same. The new government established in Nanjing was created by the Japanese authorities and is not a true Chinese government, but a puppet government similar to the "Manchukuo" government. We are well aware of the treatment of U.S. interests in Manchuria and within the jurisdiction of the so-called "Nanjing New Government." Therefore, I warmly support Secretary of State Hull's declaration yesterday. (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>According to well-informed sources yesterday, the statements made by Secretary of State Hull of Washington and the Japanese government in Tokyo regarding the establishment of the "New Nanjing Government" in China indicate that the rift between Japan and the United States has been deepening since the United States abolished the U.S.-Japan Commerce Treaty. It is rare for Hull to issue a statement in such a frank tone, and the views repeatedly stated by the Tokyo government are what the United States is determined to oppose. Influential Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman said, "I am completely convinced by Hull's statement." It is also heard that the Latin American countries will follow the United States in not recognizing Wang Jingwei's "New Government." (United Press dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Political circles here believe that the statement issued by U.S. Secretary of State Hull regarding the establishment of the "Nanjing Government" under the leadership of Wang Jingwei is a manifestation of the most sincere friendship of the United States towards China. The main point of the statement is that even if aggression spreads, the U.S. government will always adhere to the path of justice. (United Press dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Today, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused to comment on the news reported from Washington that U.S. Secretary of State Hull had announced a policy of non-recognition towards the Wang Jingwei regime, pending official information on the matter. However, the spokesman expressed his personal opinion that this news can be considered evidence of the U.S. lack of understanding of the true situation in East Asia. Hull's remarks are inconsistent with the U.S. note of December 30, which stated that the United States would not hesitate to recognize the current development of the situation. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Issues Remarks Praising U.S. Justice; Hull Clarifies the U.S. Position; Friendship with China Takes Another Step Forward</h3>
<p>Chongqing: After U.S. Secretary of State Hull issued a statement that the U.S. government would never recognize the Nanjing puppet regime, a United Press reporter stationed in Chongqing immediately visited Foreign Minister Wang to inquire about his opinion. Foreign Minister Wang issued the following remarks: The U.S. position of upholding international law and international order will not be changed by false propaganda or any political disguise. Today, the United States has once again stated that it will deny the situation created by force. The Japanese military should know that its plan to dominate Asia and the Pacific will become a bubble. Secretary of State Hull's statement is sufficient to indicate that the U.S. government has a deep understanding of the events that have occurred in the Far East since the September 18 Incident in 1931. The Chinese government and the Chinese people are very pleased to hear this. This is a further expression of the traditional friendship between China and the United States, and it is also a clear indication that the policy taken by the United States is to uphold the dignity of international treaties such as the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Since the July 7 Incident, the Japanese warlords have expanded their aggression to most of China's territory. The dishonorable acts of the Japanese army are well known to the American people. Although the Japanese have repeatedly made promises to third countries, the rights and interests of third countries in China have been completely trampled. The so-called "New Order in East Asia" is just a smokescreen for establishing a Japanese regime in China, which is disguised as Chinese and completely excludes the rights and interests of Western countries in Asia. China's belief in the justice of the United States is becoming more and more firm, and it feels that with China's determination to resist, there will eventually be a day when justice will prevail over power. The puppet show recently performed by Japan is only material for the contempt of the Chinese people. (Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Note Delivered by Embassies Abroad</p>
<p>Washington: Chinese Ambassador to the United States Dr. Hu Shih delivered a note to the State Department today from the National Government of his country denouncing the "Nanjing New Government." Its wording is the same as that delivered by his country's envoys to the governments of other countries, strongly stating that those participating in this "New Government" are purely puppets created and controlled by the Japanese warlords. The National Government of China hereby solemnly declares that "any illegal organization, such as the one currently being established in Nanjing, or established elsewhere in China, regardless of what behavior is used, is naturally completely invalid. The National Government and people of China will absolutely not recognize it." (Havas News Agency dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Paris: The Chinese Embassy in France issued a declaration today from the National Government denouncing the "Nanjing New Government." According to Chinese sources close to the embassy, the country's envoys abroad, especially those stationed in Britain, France, the United States, Belgium, Germany, and the Soviet Union, have telegraphed the National Government and "the compatriots of the whole country," denouncing the so-called "Nanjing New Central Government" and referring to those involved as "traitors." (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>U.S. Newspaper Supports Hull's Declaration</p>
<p>New York: After Secretary of State Hull issued a declaration yesterday, stating that the United States would never recognize the "Nanjing New Government," the New York Times wrote an article in support, stating that the National Government led by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek is the true Chinese government, which has respected the rights of all countries in the past and should continue to do so in the future. The land it governs still accounts for more than half of China's territory, and it is currently resisting the most unreasonable act of aggression in history with all its strength. Therefore, we advocate that the Washington Nine-Power Treaty and other signatory countries should strengthen their encouragement and assistance. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>Envoys Abroad, Gu Weijun, etc., Send Telegrams Opposing the Puppet Organization; Protests Held Across the Country</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Chinese envoys abroad, Gu Weijun, Guo Taiqi, Hu Shih, Chen Jie, Zhang Qian, Hu Shize, Jin Wensi, Xiong Chongzhi, Li Jun, Wu Nanru, Tan Shaohua, Wang Jingqi, Xie Weilin, Liang Long, Li Dijun, Tong Deqian, Xu Daolin, Liu Naijun, etc., jointly telegraphed Chairman Lin and Chairman Jiang, opposing the puppet organization. (Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Northeast generals Ma Zhanshan, etc., and people across the country have protested against the puppet organization. Rallies have been held in Guilin, Kunming, Guiyang, Shaoguan, Ji'an, Jinhua, Fuzhou, Chengdu, Xi'an, Luochang, Xingji, Lanzhou, Xining, and other places, with enthusiastic scenes. (Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>Secretary-General Wei Wen Issues Remarks</h3>
<p>Chongqing: A reporter paid a visit to Secretary-General Wei Wen of the National Government, who gave the following remarks: The National Government moved its office to Chongqing in order to implement the national policy of long-term resistance in order to achieve the final victory. It issued a declaration on November 20, 1937, announcing it to the people of the country. Now, the government is engaged in the great cause of resisting Japan and building the country in Chongqing. The day when victory is completed and the triumphant return will be the time to return to the capital. This shows that national sovereignty is supreme. The government is the organ for exercising governing power. How can it be possible to exercise the functions of government in an area occupied by the Japanese army and subject to them? Now, under the protection of the Japanese, it falsely claims that the National Government has returned to the capital. It is self-evident that it is a puppet organization. This is just another form of Japanese aggression. It shows that Japanese aggression has completely failed, so it is taking this self-deceiving action in desperation. (Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Issues Statement Supporting the Puppet Organization</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese army issued a statement at 4:00 PM on the 30th, saying that its life is constantly developing, things are changing all the time, and the international order is also following this. Japan has always been committed to promoting international justice and establishing human peace. Now, the Central Government of China has been established, and the construction of a new China has also begun. In addition to celebrating its establishment, the Japanese government will provide full cooperation and support for its development based on repeated statements. Japan is expecting that all countries can recognize this obvious fact and quickly participate in the construction of peace in East Asia. Seeing the development of a regenerated China will mark a turning point in the situation in East Asia. Needless to say, Japan will not hesitate to use force against the remaining anti-Japanese forces who are still dreaming of communism. For all obstacles that may arise in the future, it will overcome and break through them with a firm determination and unswerving preparation, so as to achieve the purpose of the "Holy War." (Allied Press dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>National Congress Women's Election Meeting Holds Inaugural Meeting</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The National Women's Election Meeting of the National Congress held its inaugural meeting today, with more than 500 people in attendance. Liu Hengjing presided over the meeting and gave a speech. Lao Junzhan reported on the preparations. After a speech by a representative of the Central Department of Social Affairs, the meeting passed the constitution, declaration, and telegrams of respect to Chairman Chiang and Madame Chiang. Finally, the directors were elected, including Tang Guozhen, Shen Huilian, Li Dequan, Shi Liang, etc. (Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>One of the Goals of the War of Resistance is to Recover Manchuria; An Article in Yishibao</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Yishibao recently published an article entitled "Manchuria is China's Lifeline," stating that one of the goals of China's current war of resistance is to recover Manchuria. The importance of Manchuria to China far exceeds that of Alsace and Lorraine to France. Manchuria's mineral resources and agricultural products are extremely abundant, and it occupies a very important position in China's national defense. Its area accounts for one-ninth of China's total area, and its population accounts for one-twelfth of the country's total population. According to the opinion of geographers, the people of Meixian in eastern Guangdong and Ai Hui in northeastern Heilongjiang are particularly rich in the spirit of struggle and enterprise. The newspaper concluded by saying that the Chinese people north and south of the Great Wall are inseparable, and Manchuria is China's lifeline. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Europe Support the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>Paris: The European Headquarters of the Chinese Kuomintang and overseas Chinese groups in various European countries have jointly telegraphed Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, denouncing the "treasonous acts" of Wang Jingwei and his followers, and expressing their loyalty to the National Government, declaring their willingness to fully support the war of resistance.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Craigie's Speech and British Far East Policy</h3>
<p>Diplomatic relations between Britain and Japan have always been regarded as a delicate issue, and have often given rise to various suspicions and misunderstandings in the international community. Part of this unfortunate situation is naturally due to the conspiracies of those who spread falsehoods and create illusions, attempting to take advantage of the world's speculation and doubt to achieve the effect of fishing in troubled waters. However, on the other hand, it is sometimes not unrelated to the ambiguous and wavering attitude of the parties concerned, which further increases the confusion of people in various countries. For example, the previous rumors about Britain and Japan concluding a secret agreement and the settlement of the Tianjin silver issue were nothing more than rumors belonging to the former phenomenon. However, the speech by British Ambassador to Japan Craigie, which has aroused considerable commotion in British and American public opinion in the past day or two, is a clear example of the latter situation.</p>
<p>Although Craigie's speech has aroused resentment and criticism in Britain and the United States, we have not yet seen the full text of the speech. Judging from the fragments released by Reuters alone, apart from Craigie's view that a compromise between Britain and Japan is possible, such as "he has taken to heart the will and successful plans announced by the Japanese government," "the two countries have gradually realized that the other's actions in the past few years have been denigrated and misrepresented," "the extent to which the real disputes are shrouded in various misunderstandings and misrepresentations is often aided by the unwelcome attention of third parties," etc., these words do have serious semantic defects and give a bad impression, and are easily interpreted as the British Far East policy is evolving in a direction contrary to what the world expects. Even British and American public opinion is quite concerned that the Far East Munich movement will be revived and that the American isolationist faction will have new excuses. After carefully analyzing Craigie's speech, this is indeed a deserved feeling.</p>
<p>In the past two or three years, Britain has indeed fulfilled some international obligations in the Far East, but its constantly hesitating and wavering attitude towards Japan is quite questionable. Especially since the outbreak of the European War, because it wanted to devote all its efforts to deal with Europe, it could not help but make more concessions to the facts in the East in order to reduce constraints. The world can indeed give considerable forgiveness for this difficulty. Even in Britain itself, it has repeatedly stated that it will never change its fundamental position of adhering to the Nine-Power Treaty and international obligations. However, the violent and arbitrary aggressors do not understand the British side's painstaking efforts to seek perfection, but instead regard it as deceptive and recklessly hold them hostage with irrational measures. As a result, the application of this policy by Britain has achieved nothing except to undermine its own prestige. Just look at the harsh treatment and humiliation suffered by people from third countries in the Japanese-occupied areas of China in the past year or so, with the British being the most severely affected. Even in the most recent month, such as the tightening of the blockade of the Tianjin Concession, the resurgence of anti-foreign movements in northern cities, and the atrocities of thugs in Zhangde threatening foreigners, they are all mainly targeted at the British, and have not been relaxed due to the fact that Britain and Japan are still engaged in negotiations in Tokyo, and it does not seem that they can be transferred by the British side's continued concessions. The political offensive recently launched by the Japanese side in China is clearly aimed at monopolizing China and excluding the rights and interests of third countries. Under these circumstances, if Britain is still prepared to continue to compromise with Japan and even waver in its own consistent position, it will not only further increase the complexity and danger of the situation in the Far East. Even in Britain itself, as the London News Chronicle pointed out the other day, it will make all the claims made by Britain to resist aggression absurd and meaningless, and even the domestic unity necessary for Britain to conduct war will be seriously affected. These are all very simple common sense, and the British authorities should not be blind to this.</p>
<p>The main stabilizing force in the Far East now is China on the one hand and the United States on the other. The previous attempts at compromise with Japan, such as the Far East Munich, have all vanished due to the firm and unwavering stance of China and the United States. Recently, the Japanese political offensive has reached a new stage. Following the Chinese National Government, the United States also issued a stern statement of denial the other day. This will undoubtedly seriously affect the actions of Britain and other countries in the Far East, and will打击一切对侵略者妥协让步的企图。So Craigie's speech is at most a kind of gesture in diplomatic rhetoric. Even if it will make the aggressors issue a knowing smile, it will also lead to the resentment of those who uphold justice, but it does not necessarily represent the direction of the entire British diplomatic line. If the British Far East policy is really going to change towards another future, it must first sacrifice the friendship of China and the sympathy of the United States, and it must also risk the danger of incurring adverse effects. This is still unimaginable, at least for the time being.</p>

<h3>Remnants of Defeated Japanese Troops Flee from Wuyuan to Bazibulong - Ambushed En Route by Chinese Forces, Two Hundred Killed - Special Service Agency Chief Kuwahara Killed in Action</h3>
<p>A unit of Chinese troops in a certain area of Suiyuan West, at 2 PM on the 24th, swept through remnants of defeated Japanese troops retreating from Wuyuan in the Liu Shijiang area. Because their rear lines were cut off, the Japanese fought like cornered beasts. After three hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese soldiers were defeated and fled in disarray to Bazibulong. More than two hundred Japanese troops were killed, including Lieutenant Colonel Kuwahara, the chief of the Japanese Wuyuan Special Service Agency, special agent Hozaku, and police officers Ikeda and Hamasaki. The Chinese forces seized fourteen boxes of artillery shells, over thirty thousand rounds of rifle and machine gun ammunition, nineteen horses, thirty-two camels, nine mules, one military flag, and many other military supplies and important documents. Currently, the Chinese forces are advancing eastward. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>In the battle of Wuyuan, which was recaptured by the Chinese forces in Suiyuan West on the 22nd, a copy of the defense plan of the Japanese Sudo unit was seized. After examination, it was learned that the Japanese were prepared to release large quantities of poison gas to defend against a Chinese attack on Wuyuan. The plan included 1,500 poison gas cylinders, 200 poison gas bombs, and a field poison gas squad assigned to create a sustained gas zone around the fortifications, fifty meters wide and one hundred meters long, to be released in large quantities when necessary. The secrecy of the Chinese forces' operation in capturing Wuyuan, and the speed of its progress, exceeded Japanese expectations, resulting in the complete failure of the Japanese plan. Poison gas was only used in the Xin cheng stronghold. The Chinese forces were prepared in advance, and fortunately, there were no losses. After the capture, there were still more than ten boxes of poison gas in the Japanese warehouse, each box containing fifteen cylinders. Experts examined it and determined that it was purely asphyxiating poison gas. The inhumanity of the Japanese army, disregarding international law and releasing asphyxiating poison gas, is evident from this. (31st Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Diet - Lifeless - Asahi Shimbun Commentary</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Prime Minister Yonai expressed great satisfaction with the 75th Diet passing the government's great legislative program, and said that the government plans to proceed with the 10,500,000,000 yen budget and legal system passed by both houses in a state that can achieve the greatest possible results, and plans to implement measures to consolidate Japan's wartime structure, so that the purpose of dealing with the China Incident can be fully achieved. However, the Asahi Shimbun criticized this Diet as a politically sad exposure, and said that the government barely escaped danger in rescuing itself. It also said that the most intense debate in this Diet was about whether the government's measures to suppress prices and expand the national output process were effective, but these two troubles have not been resolved. The final decision will inevitably be made by the government regardless of the opinion of the Diet. Another unfortunate feature of this Diet is the number of times meetings were held in secret, especially regarding the handling of the Saito case, the national spiritual mobilization program, and the promotion of national productivity measures. The government has adopted a bureaucratic policy for matters that should be brought to the public's attention, and keeping secrets is very regrettable. Judging from the amount of time spent in meetings and the number of exchanges, we feel that both the Diet members and the government have made many unnecessary speeches, repeating themselves, and rarely trying to hold positive opinions or trying to sharpen matters. And the cabinet members' answers seem to be evasive. The newspaper concluded that, in short, the government has a clear policy for dealing with this year's Diet, and it often refuses to make a conclusion or clarify the main points that the Diet members and the national people want to understand. At the same time, those who ask questions cannot control their questions, and they should also be blamed. Most Diet members only repeat the words of others or make lecture-style debates, so that the government cannot understand their intentions. The comments of the Japan Broad Knowledge News are more moderate, saying that the Diet's handling of events is very satisfactory. All Diet members have expressed concern about national issues. It is only regrettable that they cannot completely eliminate political disputes, resulting in new divisions among political parties when the country urgently needs to be united to deal with various policies and issues, which is regrettable.

<h3>US Naval Exercise Range to Expand to the Philippines - US Navy Secretary Edison Issues Statement - Fleet Must Be Concentrated in the Pacific</h3>
<p>Washington - According to US Navy officials yesterday, this year's US Navy Pacific maneuvers may extend as far as Samoa and the Philippines. The general location of the maneuvers will be in the central Pacific, with a diameter of 5,000 nautical miles, with Hawaii as a relatively appropriate center. However, the distance between the two ends can range from the Arctic Circle to the equatorial islands used by the United States as air force reconnaissance bases. The maneuvers will include air force formations and air force reconnaissance. According to officials, this is necessary for the defense of the northern hemisphere. As for the scope of naval activities, it is only limited to attack and reconnaissance. It is generally believed that Howland, Johnston, Palmyra, and Canton Islands will all be designated as naval air transfer locations, because they are very far apart. It is also reported that the Navy will reenact land battles in Hawaii. (31st Allied Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington - The upcoming US Navy exercise in the Pacific is a threat to Japan. Navy Secretary Edison issued a statement to the press yesterday, firmly denying this, saying, "The US government must ensure the security of the Panama Canal Zone, and must also consider the country's strategic position. Therefore, as a good strategic plan, it is necessary to concentrate the fleet in the Pacific, so that if our country is threatened, whether from the Atlantic or the Pacific, we can immediately respond. According to the current situation, we really have no reason to change the current concentration point of the fleet." In addition, the government also plans to build several docks in various ports along the Pacific coast that are large enough to accommodate the largest battleships for future repairs.

<h3>Philippine President's Speech - US-Philippine Relations</h3>
<p>Manila - President Quezon said in a speech at the Faculty of Law of the University of the Philippines yesterday that he theoretically supports considering the issue of Philippine independence, but he believes that there are other solutions to the Philippine issue besides the Independence Act. He is sure that what the United States especially allows is not a condition that allows US sovereignty to continue to exist in the Philippines. If the Filipinos obtain the right to decide on the constitution, discuss political affairs, and guide economic life, the current US-Philippine relations can continue. Therefore, this is the only condition for maintaining the current relationship. He also stated that the US-Philippine economic relationship is not good and is not suitable for the interests of the Philippines. If the Filipinos have the right to negotiate commercial treaties with other countries, this relationship may be improved. He reiterated his belief that the Filipinos lack defense capabilities and does not believe that the Filipinos will be able to cope with foreign aggression in twenty-five years. He does not believe that the United States will consider placing the Philippines under the US flag during the period when it needs protection against aggression. (31st Allied Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Dutch East Indies - Defense Issues</h3>

<h3>Precarious Situation in Macau - Portuguese and Japanese Conduct Negotiations - Japanese Demand Withdrawal of Portuguese Troops</h3>
<p>Macau - Although there is no official confirmation of the news that the Japanese authorities are demanding that the Macau authorities withdraw Portuguese troops and allow the Japanese to search for anti-Japanese elements, a subtle situation has emerged between the Japanese and Portuguese in Macau. Although the Macau authorities are keeping the content of their negotiations with the Japanese secret, Portuguese officials have protested to the Japanese for their increasing attempts to invade Portuguese territory. It is generally believed that the Japanese activities in Macau are a trial balloon to see what the results will be, so as to facilitate the implementation of the same strategy elsewhere in China. Two weeks ago, a Japanese steamship entered the port of Macau to chase a Chinese merchant ship and fired shots at the merchant ship. The Japanese later explained that this was an "unintentional" act, which was accepted by the Macau authorities. In another incident, several armed Japanese soldiers broke into a Macau gambling den and forced the use of their military currency. Others ordered expensive dishes at the New Central Hotel and ate and drank heavily without paying. The Portuguese police ignored all of this. According to reliable sources, Japanese military police have accompanied Portuguese police on several searches of anti-Japanese Chinese students in various schools in Macau. It is also reported that the Japanese military has demanded that the Macau authorities hand over unnamed naval officials who are seeking refuge in Macau. According to official estimates, there are 80,000 Chinese refugees in Macau since the Japanese invasion of Guangdong. The Portuguese troops were stationed on Lapa Island at this time, so the Japanese military authorities used the excuse of avoiding accidents to demand the withdrawal of the Portuguese troops from the island. (31st Allied Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Lisbon - A Portuguese Foreign Ministry spokesman said yesterday that negotiations between Japanese and Portuguese authorities are taking place in Macau, the subject of which is the various problems arising from the Japanese occupation of Chinese islands in the Macau region.

<h3>Italy Closely Watches Near East Situation</h3>
<p>Rome - Well-informed sources recently stated that the situation in the Balkans and the Near East is still being closely watched by the Italian government. Any changes in the status quo or balance of power there will not be tolerated by Italy. In this regard, the Italian government attaches great importance to the improvement of relations between Britain, France, and Turkey, and is deeply concerned that Britain and France may send warships through the Dardanelles and the Bosporus Straits to the Black Sea to intercept Soviet oil destined for Germany after obtaining the consent of the Turkish government, and take the opportunity to comfort Romania, showing that if that country is invaded by the Soviet Union, Britain and France will come to its aid. If this is the case, Italy will also have to send warships to the Black Sea to protect its maritime traffic, or, in accordance with the provisions of the Montreux Convention, Italy will also have the right to do so.

Walsh recalled that he had opposed the Guam construction plan because he did not want to hinder Japanese friendship. He ridiculed "Japan's admission that it has been operating commercial air routes between Japan and Saipan and Palau Islands," and condemned Japan's refusal of the right to pass through the mandated islands.

<h3>Molotov Reports on Current State of Soviet-Japanese Diplomacy - Border Demarcation Issue Still Unresolved - Ridicules Japanese Diet's Trivial Suggestions</h3>
<p>Moscow - Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov delivered a speech today at the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, in which he mentioned relations with Japan, "Regarding our relations with Japan, we have resolved several issues with considerable difficulty. This can be proven by the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement signed on December 31, 1939, and the fact that the Japanese paid the last installment of the Chinese Eastern Railway funds. However, we cannot express satisfaction with Soviet-Japanese relations. To date, the issue of border demarcation at the sites where conflicts occurred last year has not been resolved. Although the Japanese have paid the last installment of the Chinese Eastern Railway funds, they are still making things difficult for us to use the funds. At the same time, the treatment of Soviet representatives in Japan and Manchuria by the Japanese authorities is extremely abnormal. To this day, Japan should understand that the Soviet Union will not tolerate any actions that undermine Soviet interests. Unless the Japanese fully recognize this point, Soviet-Japanese relations cannot develop satisfactorily. When the Japanese Diet met the other day, a certain Diet member actually said, 'Should we forever eliminate Soviet-Japanese disputes? The method is to buy the coastal area and other territories from the Soviet Union.' We believe that this kind of suggestion is extremely trivial and cannot raise the status of the Japanese Diet. In our opinion, since the Japanese Diet feels so interested in trade, why not mention the issue of selling Sakhalin Island?" (29th TASS Dispatch)</p>
<h3>French and German Newspapers Comment on Soviet Diplomacy</h3>
<p>Paris - The speech delivered yesterday by Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov at the Supreme Soviet has been commented on by various newspapers here, all with a skeptical attitude. Among them, Le Temps stated that the Soviet Union is bound to once again take advantage of Germany's current difficult situation, and systematically pursue its imperialist goals. First, the Soviet Union will not clearly state its position until both belligerent countries have formally entered the decisive stage in terms of spirit and material resources. Second, if the Soviet Union adheres to its current policy, it will inevitably do everything possible to prevent Hitler's success, because Germany's true victory is not necessarily the end of the Soviet Union.

<p>Berlin - The "German Foreign Political Correspondence" stated that Molotov's speech was a serious blow to Western European countries. The Allied countries claim that their policies are conducive to world order. Molotov's speech has effectively eliminated this false argument. German-Soviet relations are based on common interests and have been fully demonstrated in the past six months. Molotov's speech not only explained the war aims of the Western European countries, but also expressed the Soviet Union's opposition to the tendency of Western European countries to expand the war zone.

<p>Rome - As of yesterday, the speech given by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov at the Supreme Soviet on March 29 had not yet been published here, and officials had not made any criticisms. However, well-informed sources who had heard the speech on the radio and obtained its content from news agency manuscripts all believe that Molotov's wording is tantamount to reiterating the Soviet Union's intention to maintain a non-aggressive attitude on the Bessarabia issue. According to Reuters' resident correspondent in Konstandi-Noti, the people of the entire Bukovina province were extremely calm after learning of the speech. The traffic between that place and the Soviet-occupied Polish border, which had been interrupted for a time due to the Soviet army's entry into Galicia, has now been restored. It is reported that local Soviet personnel have assured the people that the Soviet Union will never attack Romania in the interests of Germany. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union Passes Foreign Policy - Expresses Condolences for Fallen Soldiers in Finland</h3>
<p>Moscow - The joint meeting of the Federal Council and the National Council of the Soviet Union was held at 7 PM on the 29th. Before the meeting started, all the seats for observers and reporters were occupied, and personnel from the diplomatic corps also attended. At 7 o'clock, leaders such as Stalin, Molotov, Voroshilov, Zhdanov, Mikoyan, and Beria entered the venue. The crowd stood up in unison and gave Stalin warm cheers. In the opening remarks, representative Anduyev suggested that we mourn the brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives in fighting the self-defense forces in Finland to defend the motherland. At that time, everyone stood up in silence to pay their respects. At 7:20, Anduyev requested that Molotov report on the Soviet government's foreign policy. The representatives and guests present gave Molotov cheers in unison. Molotov explained the Soviet government's foreign policy over the past five months in his speech. Molotov's sharp remarks were greatly welcomed by those present. When Molotov finished his speech, the crowd applauded warmly. Then, at the suggestion of Congressman Bagulev, the conference decided not to debate Molotov's report any further and passed the following resolution: "The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, after listening to Molotov's foreign policy report, decided to pass the Soviet government's foreign policy." At this point, the conference adjourned. The next joint meeting is scheduled to be held on the 31st. (31st TASS Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Molotov's Full Speech (Yesterday)</h3>
<p>"Then why did the ruling authorities of Britain, France, and many other countries provide assistance to Finland in this war with such an active posture against ____? The fact that the British and French governments tried their best to prevent the end of the Finnish war and the restoration of peace is well known. They were not subject to any restrictions on Finland. There is a mutual assistance treaty between the country and the Czech Republic, but France did not provide assistance. This is also well known. However, Britain and France actively provided military assistance to Finland and tried their best to prevent the end of the Soviet-Finnish war and the restoration of peace. A group of hired writers who deceive readers by fabricating news actually said that this action by Britain and France was caused by concern for 'small countries.' It is ridiculous to think that this policy of Britain and France was caused by special concern for the rights and interests of the country. It is also absurd to think that this is because they want to fulfill their obligations to protect member states of the League of Nations. Less than a year ago, Italy invaded Albania and destroyed its independence. Albania is also a member state of the League of Nations. Then, did Britain and France rise up to defend Albania? Italy forcibly conquered Albania, disregarding its millions of people and completely disregarding Albania's membership in the League of Nations. Then, did Britain and France ever make even a weak protest against Italy's actions?"</p>
<p>"No, the governments of Britain, France, and the United States have never taken any action, because the League of Nations is controlled by British and French imperialists. For ten months, these protectors of 'small countries' and 'defenders' of the rights and interests of League of Nations member states have not raised any questions in the League of Nations regarding Italy's occupation of Albania. This happened in April of last year. Not only that, they have in fact tacitly recognized Italy's aggression. Therefore, the assistance of the British and French ruling authorities to Finland's resistance against the Soviet Union is not to defend small countries or guarantee the rights and interests of League of Nations member states. They are helping Finland because they have a military base in Finland from which to attack the Soviet Union, and Albania does not occupy such an important position in their plans. The British imperialist newspaper "The Times," the French imperialist newspaper "Le Temps," and other petty bourgeois newspapers in Britain and France have openly advocated interfering in the Soviet Union in the past few months, turning a blind eye to the fact that there are still so-called normal diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Britain and France. In collusion with these petty bourgeois newspapers, there are also "socialists" of the British Attlee type and the French Blum type, giving speeches that incite the spread of war.</p>
<p>From the mouths of the British and French imperialist newspapers and "socialist" confidants, we hear the imperialist cry of hatred for socialist countries</p>

<p>London – British Naval Minister Churchill delivered a broadcast speech yesterday, reviewing the progress of the war, saying that Britain and France have now formed an inseparable entity, in order to achieve their noble purpose, and have made considerable progress in all aspects, strengthening their armies, consolidating their defenses, and improving their economic and living methods, so as to adapt to the service of common ideals. When he spoke to the nation six months ago, he said that if no major events occurred by spring, the Allied Powers would have won a major victory. He still feels today that this period of preparation is extremely helpful to the Allied Powers, because it is far more difficult for a nation with a parliamentary system to transform into a large-scale war machine than it is for a dictatorship that glorifies war and uses the dreams of victory to anesthetize its youth. To date, the Allied Powers have benefited from time, but the situation is not immutable. In his view, the war will intensify. We will certainly not shrink back from this. We will not allow ourselves to boast or deceive ourselves with excessive confidence. We have never underestimated the terrible nature of what we are undertaking. After striving for peace for a long time, we decided to undertake the task of coping with the Nazi scourge, in order to find a way that can clear the path of human progress and allow all countries to breathe freely for a long time to come. We have never neglected our work, but we can now review our work more accurately than we could when we first engaged the enemy at sea and in the air.</p>
<p>Not Concealing Current Hardships</p>
<p>We do not conceal the current hardships, which are incomparable to what we have already experienced. It is a fact that we must acknowledge. Once the Allied Powers' manpower is fully developed, it will far exceed that of the enemy. The British and French nations together have 110 million people, while the Germans have less than 70 million. There are 16 million people under German violent force, which we cannot count. The Allied Powers' naval power is becoming increasingly complete, and the resources of the whole world are mostly available for our use. Therefore, in terms of the overall situation, we firmly believe that if we do well, we will never fail. As for the question of how long the war will last, this war may be very short, and it may not even become a war, as long as the neutral countries have the same beliefs as we do on basic issues, and those who openly or secretly express sympathy with us unite and stand on the same line. But we do not expect this, so we are not disappointed. We trust in the true God and our own strength. However, many smaller countries in Europe are threatened by Nazi violence and barbarism and have to supply Germany with the raw materials needed for modern warfare. This fact may subject the world to a long-term war, causing terrible consequences to spread to many places. Therefore, he cannot assure the nation that the war will not last long, nor can he make easy remarks about the war. He believes that it is the duty of the Allied Powers to do their best to carry out the war, not only to win victory, but also to shorten the process of war destruction as much as possible. He has great sympathy for the neutral countries that are unfortunately neighbors of Germany, understands their dangers and their point of view. For the general good, the weakness of the neutral countries has become the strength of the aggressor. Human suffering is not appropriate. At this critical moment of life and death, if the aggressor tramples on all human feelings and those who are with the aggressor are always bound by the treaties that have been destroyed, how can this be considered fair?</p>
<p>Criticizing Germany's Naval Warfare Methods</p>
<p>The shipping and sailors of European countries are almost daily subjected to cruel and barbaric new atrocities. Ships are either destroyed by mines, sunk by torpedoes, or bombed by enemy aircraft, and their sailors are slaughtered if we cannot rescue them. The shipping of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and even Italy has all become victims of Hitler's brutal behavior. Hitler and his criminal regime, in their state of frantic recklessness, are increasingly poisoning those who they claim still have friendly relations with Germany. Even unarmed merchant ships are often attacked, but they feel safe in the American and French escort fleets. Of the 800 neutral ships under the protection of the Allied Powers, only one has been lost. Just yesterday, eight Dutch sailors, who had been stranded at sea for six days, were rescued by a British submarine and brought ashore. At the same time, Dutch aviators opened fire and shot down a stray British aircraft in the name of strict neutrality. The Netherlands was once a brave ally of Britain. We do not intend to blame them. The Netherlands is in a situation like being caged with a tiger. Their danger and suffering make us feel sympathy. However, when we are asked to explain the meaning of neutrality, which provides various conveniences to the aggressor and adds various inconveniences to the defender, he cannot recall the words of Lord Balfour in the past: "This is a particularly badly designed world." The atrocities at sea, compared to the atrocities suffered by the Czechs and Austrians, and all the suffering of Poland, are still trivial. Yesterday, he inspected the crew of a Polish destroyer. Their discipline and behavior were so good that he had rarely seen it. He was deeply moved, but how tragic was their situation? Their ship was still there, but their country had fallen. When he looked around at the major warships and other preparations moored in the port, he had a thought and consoled himself. What was this thought? That is, when these Polish sailors complete their work in the British Navy in the future, we should pay special attention to making sure that these people have a home to return to. Although the shallow and ignorant people have witnessed the fate of Poland, they still sometimes ask Britain and France about the war. He replied, "If we stop fighting, you will know." We will follow the war wherever it is, but we do not want to expand the area of the war.</p>
<p>Willing to Maintain Friendship with Italy and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>When the war first started, we did not know that Italy would not be our enemy, nor could we be sure that Japan would not join the enemy. At the same time, many people hoped that the Soviet Union could rejoin the ranks of the Allied Powers and help protect the workers of the world from Nazi aggression. However, none of these expectations, good or bad, have been realized. We have no dispute with the people of Italy or Japan. We are willing to always strive to maintain friendship with them, and our policy is not to seek fault with the Soviet Union. Unless the Soviet Union is driven by the stale imperial ambitions, harbors evil intentions, and wishes to join the German side, there is no reason for the Soviet Union to be drawn into the war. What we want to deal with is Hitler and Nazi power. The culprit is here. What we want to defeat is only this. Everything is quiet on the Western Front. There is nothing going on in the air and sea today. However, more than a million German troops are prepared to launch an attack along the borders of Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands within hours of receiving orders. These neutral countries are at risk of encountering gunfire at any time, and the one who controls them is the demon that the confused Germans worship as God. This is the situation in Europe tonight. We are determined to end this state of panic and disaster as quickly as possible in a way that solves the problem once and for all. Are there people who doubt this? Among those who look back at the situation of the past seven months and still doubt the British and French people's righteousness in drawing their swords to uphold justice, there should be no one tonight. And there should be no one who sheathes their swords before this solemn and just work is completed. (Roadside Press Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Britain to Intensify Implementation of Blockade Plan Against Germany; Preventing German Ships from Sailing in Northern Europe; German Warships Concentrating in the North Sea Area</h3>
<p>Copenhagen, Denmark – After the German warships learned of the news from the British Embassy here, they have moved towards the North Sea and the Skagerrak Strait. Since Churchill delivered his speech, people here believe that the British Navy will intensify its violation of the neutrality of the Northern European countries. Well-informed sources said that after the intelligence personnel of the British Embassy announced that "the British Navy will take action," the German warships moved north. Well-informed observers predict that Britain will intensify its blockade plan to prevent German merchant ships from sailing in Northern Europe, and will also dispatch submarines, destroyers, and cruisers to the Skagerrak Strait. Its scope of activity will include the territorial waters of neutral countries. People in London regard the seaports of neutral countries as loopholes in the British blockade network and openly advocate preventing Swedish ore from being transported to Germany via Narvik. Observers here believe that Britain will take action in Norwegian territorial waters. They also predict that the Far East will also intensify its control over imports to Vladivostok. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden – According to "Svenska Dagbladet," the Allied Powers are attempting to blockade Norwegian territorial waters in order to prevent Swedish ore from being transported to Germany, but German ships will still transport Swedish ore to Germany via Bosnia and the Baltic Sea. The British Navy cannot enter the Baltic Sea. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Finland's Wartime Losses Estimated to Reach 30 Billion Marks</h3>
<p>Helsinki – It was recently announced here that Finland's wartime losses are estimated at 30 billion Finnish marks, equivalent to the Finnish government's total expenditure for six years, half of which is military expenditure, and the rest is the loss of ceded areas and the destruction of air raids. The reconstruction of Turku requires 30 million to 40 million marks, Tampere requires about 10 million marks, and other cities require 100 million marks. Various insurance companies have borne 20% of this expense. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister to Deliver Important Speech</h3>
<p>London – According to well-informed sources, Prime Minister Chamberlain is expected to deliver an important speech in the House of Commons on the 2nd or 4th, explaining the results obtained at the 6th Joint Meeting of the British and French Supreme Defense Committee, especially the decision to intensify the implementation of the blockade policy.

<h3>German Communiqué Claims Sinking of British Cruiser; British Navy Officially Denies; German Submarine Mine Warfare Has Been Suppressed; Large-Scale Air Raids Expected</h3>
<p>Berlin – The German High Command issued a communiqué yesterday stating that the German Air Force attacked an enemy convoy off North Foreland, England, on the 29th, destroying a cruiser escorting merchant ships with bombs and sinking a merchant ship. (Reuters Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>London – The German High Command's claim that a British merchant ship was sunk and a British escort cruiser was destroyed off North Foreland on March 19th was denied by the British Admiralty in a communiqué yesterday, stating that the enemy air raid did not cause any damage to the British side, and one enemy aircraft was shot down. (Reuters Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>London – Well-informed sources here predict that the stalemate in the war between Britain, France, and Germany will be followed by extremely intense large-scale air combat. It is said that Germany, in view of the fact that its policy of using submarines and mines to attack has been greatly suppressed, may rely on its only weapon that has not yet been tried, that is, its so-called invincible air force, to attempt to destroy merchant ships transporting important food and raw materials to Britain on a large scale. It is generally believed that the Italian bombers' act of deliberately trampling on merchant ships during the Spanish Civil War in order to oppose France may be re-enacted by Germany, and its scale will be even larger. However, the ships bombed by Italian bombers in the past were not escorted by aircraft and had no anti-aircraft guns for defense. Today, the situation may be very different. The British authorities expect German aircraft to launch a large-scale attack on Britain's lifeline and have adopted extraordinary measures of offense as defense. The nature of these measures cannot be disclosed due to military secrets, but one point can be pointed out, that is, the British Air Force is now able to frequently encounter German aircraft in German territory and has repeatedly won victories. As for the small number of German aircraft bombing British naval facilities, although the number of times is many, according to the British government's report, the British aircraft have never lost a single aircraft or person each time they intercept these German aircraft, and the German losses have been extremely huge. At present, strong aircraft patrol teams are patrolling over the English Channel and the North Sea. Anti-aircraft balloons are set up on fishing boats along the eastern coast. The ports of the Thames River, the main artery of London's commerce, are scattered and almost without loopholes. In addition, the shipyards, arsenals, aircraft factories, and naval camps on the eastern coast are surrounded by air defense facilities, which are said to be the strongest in the world. (Special Correspondent Nickson, International News Agency, 31st)</p>
<p>London – According to an official announcement by the Commander-in-Chief of the British Air Force, two German aircraft were shot down and set on fire by British fighters yesterday and crashed behind the German lines. Another German aircraft was also attacked, and one of its engines was damaged and fell straight down into the lower clouds. (Reuters Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>German Aeronautics Authority, Schüdde, Passes Away</h3>
<p>Berlin – Professor Schüdde, a famous German aeronautics authority, passed away in Dresden yesterday at the age of 67. Schüdde built 20 airships and made great contributions to bombing Britain during the World War. He has repeatedly won government awards and served as chairman of the Aeronautics Association for many years. (Ocean Shipping News Agency Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>After Germany Announces Polish Archives, US Authorities Are Drafting a Reply; Believing Germany's Goal is to Divide US Public Opinion; Extreme Attention Paid to Soviet Union's White Paper on Germany</h3>
<p>New York – The New York Times' Washington correspondent recently telegraphed that after the German Foreign Ministry issued a white paper involving the United States, the US responsible authorities are drafting a detailed report on Germany's propaganda campaign in the United States to respond to it. The content includes an analysis of various diplomatic documents, the texts instructed by the German authorities, and the speeches broadcast by the country's various radio stations, so as to point out that these texts and speeches are aimed at influencing or dividing US public opinion. (Havas Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>The Hague – Political figures here commented on the white paper issued by the German Foreign Ministry, saying that this is part of a large-scale German propaganda campaign aimed at preventing US President Roosevelt from being re-elected. This can be seen from the date of the white paper's publication, the documents selected in the content, the comments of German newspapers, and the information obtained by observers in various neutral countries. Because when US Undersecretary of State Welles came to inspect before, the German side hoped to establish a compromise peace plan and hoped that the US government could support it. By now, this hope has vanished. The mask worn by Germany has also been peeled off, and it has launched a large-scale criticism of President Roosevelt. Regarding this, the German Cologne Daily News carried a statement that is quite noteworthy, that is, "We hope that after the publication of the white paper, the American public will be enlightened." In short, the various documents published by Germany are sufficient to prove that the country deliberately wants to make Roosevelt suffer suspicion and openly lists the United States in the "democratic camp that surrounds Germany." In addition, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech yesterday did not attack the United States. The fact that the two "allied countries," Germany and the Soviet Union, have gone their separate ways to such an extent has made the German people uneasy. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>Paris – The white paper issued by the German Foreign Ministry, especially the various documents involving US diplomacy, has recently been commented on by various newspapers. The Daily News stated that the German authorities intended to interfere in US internal affairs and make US public opinion oppose the current government. "This is only the initial method of Germany's large-scale propaganda campaign. We will definitely hear more later." The White Sun Daily stated that this matter was initiated by the German Foreign Ministry, and its sole goal was to undermine President Roosevelt's re-election and make it available to those who oppose the government. Moreover, because the US government refused to support the German peace plan and supplied the latest aircraft to Britain and France, it wanted to retaliate. However, this matter may cause a major backlash in diplomacy. (Havas Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Moscow – Extreme attention is being paid here to the important Polish archives published by the German Foreign Ministry, especially the so-called "peace policy" promoted by the United States in the months before the European war, which is considered unexpected. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Rome – The Forum Newspaper recently wrote an article commenting on the important Polish archives published by German newspapers yesterday, saying that these documents prove in many ways that Britain and France, especially Britain, had already begun to prepare to fight against Germany since 1935. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Berlin – Newspapers here have published the important Polish archives in large characters. Regarding the American aspect, the views are that the "People's Observer" believes that the authenticity of this document is beyond doubt. Polish Ambassador to the United States Potocki's secret report mentioned the anti-German sentiment in the United States and the Jewish problem, which has proven that the important position and propaganda campaign of Jews in the United States, and responsible people, are carrying out anti-German propaganda for national political reasons and influencing American European diplomacy. The "Berlin Local Daily" stated that this document has described the propaganda activities of Jews in the United States, and who wants to fight has also become clear. The "German Daily News" stated that the report of Polish Ambassador to France Łukasiewicz has proven that the French government, under the pressure of war propaganda, has actually broken the road of peaceful politics agreed upon with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop.

<h3>Antarctic Explorer Returns to Chile</h3>
<p>Santiago, Chile – US famous Antarctic explorer Admiral Byrd's team returned north from Antarctic exploration and arrived here today. According to him, the female ship sailed 7,000 miles and never encountered a ship or island. All the team members were quite tired, but they were extremely satisfied with the exploration results.

<h3>Military Affairs Commission Announces Week's Battle Situation; March 23rd to 29th</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The speaker of the Military Affairs Commission said that since this week (March 23rd to 29th), victories have been achieved on various lines. In particular, the Japanese in Suiyuan and southern Guangxi were severely counterattacked by the Chinese army with thunderous force, creating a great annihilation war. The heavy damage suffered by the Japanese and the speed of their defeat have been unprecedented in recent months. The battle process is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Suiyuan – The Chinese army recovered Wuyuan, annihilated more than 3,400 Japanese, including many important Japanese officials, and seized a large number of artillery and vehicles, inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese. The Japanese successively increased reinforcements from Guihua and other places, to the vicinity of Da Caizhu Village (east of Zhegui Township), north of the Wujia River, attempting to cross the river to counterattack. On the 24th, they fought fiercely on the banks of the Wujia River all day. Subsequently, the Japanese increased reinforcements to counterattack, forcibly crossing the river in the vicinity of Da Caizhu and Zhegui Township to the west of it, and fought extremely fiercely with the Chinese army. The Chinese army used mobile tactics to trick the main force of the Japanese army back into the encirclement to completely annihilate them. In recent days, the Chinese army has advanced and attacked, which has been extremely successful. At present, one route has reached Maoqitu southwest of Anbei, and another route has reached Gongmiao Store on the eastern section of the Baotou-Wuyuan Highway (south of the Wula Mountains), intensifying the annihilation of the remaining Japanese.</p>
<p>Southern Guangxi – After the Japanese occupied Lingshan, the Chinese army immediately used its superior terrain to launch a fierce counterattack against the Japanese. The Japanese forces collapsed, and the Chinese army recovered Lingshan. Under the heavy pressure of the Chinese army, the remaining Japanese retreated in three routes: the northern route retreated towards Nanning, the middle route retreated along the highway through Luwu to Xiaodong, and the southern route was forced to retreat towards Bailaowei. In order to completely annihilate the remaining Japanese, the Chinese army also divided into three routes to pursue and intercept the Japanese from the front and rear, killing thousands of Japanese. The remaining Japanese were unable to advance or retreat and again moved towards Funan in two routes on the 26th, attempting to break through. They were fiercely attacked by the Chinese army near Zhugensha, and countless Japanese were killed and wounded. On the afternoon of the 27th, part of the Japanese army arrived near Funan. The Chinese army rose up to block and attack them, and the battle was extremely fierce. By the afternoon of the 28th, part of the Japanese army had entered the city and is now under siege.</p>
<p>Southern Anhui – Fierce fighting suddenly broke out in the areas of Chizhou and Dongliu in southern Anhui on the 24th. The Japanese launched a large-scale attack on Wuyue Mountain, Zhazi Bridge, Xiaomeiling, and other places from Xiangkou in two routes. After being severely attacked by the Chinese army, the Japanese were unable to succeed. On the 26th, the Japanese retreated in a panic. The Chinese army rose up to attack, seizing a large number of weapons. On the 27th, the Japanese army again attacked in two groups, one attacking Zhoujiashan and the other attacking Qitou Mountain. After being counterattacked by the Chinese army, the Japanese were defeated and fled in different directions, abandoning countless corpses, weapons, and ammunition.</p>
<p>Southern Shanxi – The Chinese army in southern Shanxi has intensified its fierce attacks on the Japanese in the strongholds of Wenxi, Anyi, Yuncheng, and Jiexian in recent days, inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese and smashing their attempt to blockade the mountain passes. In total, no less than a thousand Japanese troops in various places have been annihilated by the Chinese army. The remaining Japanese are constantly increasing reinforcements and stubbornly resisting. The Chinese army has completely destroyed the Japanese transportation lines. The Japanese in Fenyang have been acting recklessly in recent days. On the 24th and 25th, the Chinese army ambushed them near Zhulin and killed many of them. The Japanese retreated to their original positions and dared not move. At present, the Fen-Li Highway has been completely controlled by the Chinese army.</p>
<p>Henan and Hubei – The Japanese troops on the border of Henan and Hubei have been acting recklessly on both sides of the Dabie Mountains in the past week. One route of more than a thousand Japanese troops was divided from Guangshui, Huang'an, and Macheng to the southern foothills several times. They were blocked by the Chinese army at Taolin River, Liuhedian, and other places. The mountain battles lasted for two days and nights. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties, and corpses were scattered everywhere. They were defeated and retreated, and the Chinese army is currently pursuing them. Another route of more than two thousand Japanese troops was divided into three groups from Xinyang to invade the northern foothills, once advancing to the vicinity of Panxindian and Longshengzhen. They were ambushed by the Chinese army, and part of the army attacked behind the Japanese, cutting off their retreat. The Japanese army was surrounded and attacked by the various Chinese armies and retreated in a panic towards Xinyang, abandoning a large number of corpses, weapons, and ammunition along the way. At this point, the Japanese's so-called "mopping up the Dabie Mountains" attempt was once again reduced to illusion.</p>
<p>In addition, the Japanese trapped in Mentougou in western Hebei are still being besieged by the Chinese army. The Japanese have made several attempts to break through but have failed. Along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, more than 500 Japanese troops have been killed in recent days. Japanese transportation is often cut off. The Chinese army attacked Longhai Road and Long Station (east of Kaifeng) in eastern Henan. The Japanese in Kaifeng felt greatly threatened. The Japanese in Xiangshan, northern Jiangsu, have been constantly attacked by the Chinese army, and their situation has been shaken. The Qiantang River Bridge in Zhejiang Province has been completely destroyed again by the Chinese army. These are all important battle achievements in the past week. A special report is attached.

<p>Modern Medicine</p>
<h3>Remedies for Declining Health and Kidney Deficiency in Middle-Aged Men</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of Medical Science, Russian Labor University</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the happiest time of life is youth, because young people are full of energy and strength. When a person reaches middle age, they will feel a lack of energy, and nothing can arouse their interest, as if the sun is setting in the west, already in decline. In particular, in the realm of sexual desire, there is often a feeling of wanting but lacking the strength. Therefore, such people, when weaving sweet dreams, trap their partners in tedious sorrow. Thus, from practical experience, it is known that if a middle-aged man has kidney deficiency and lets it continue naturally, the love between husband and wife will inevitably not be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Although some people, due to proper hygiene and health maintenance, have energy and sexual desire that are healthier than young people even after reaching middle age, this is relatively rare. Therefore, many middle-aged people are still troubled by physical weakness, especially in the realm of sex, which is the most severe. The cause of this is entirely due to excessive masturbation or indulgence and debauchery, leading to a decline in metabolic function, and a related decline in sexual desire. Therefore, they often suffer from symptoms such as nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, and neurasthenia.</p>
<p>According to the most advanced modern medical theory, the most important gland in the human body is the reproductive gland. Because vigorous secretion of the reproductive gland can promote the development and prosperity of all parts of the body, and strengthen sexual function. Based on this powerful scientific evidence, German physiologist Dr. Meulen invented the male "Bu Ti Kang" reproductive gland endocrine preparation, which functions to nourish the brain, blood, kidneys, and replenish blood. Those suffering from nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, etc., are guaranteed hope of rejuvenation after taking it. When I was studying medicine at the Russian Labor University, I applied "Bu Ti Kang" clinically for seven years and never encountered a case of failure.</p>
<h3>Case of Impotence and Infertility Cured</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng Ting, Doctor of Medicine, Germany</p>
<p>The patient, Hu Bixian, is 27 years old and from Jinhua, Zhejiang. He has been in Shanghai for eight years, running a local products business. He married at the age of 21, and seven years have passed without any children. He came for a consultation in early February of the 28th year of the Republic of China. The symptoms at the time of diagnosis were: Mr. Hu had a history of masturbation in his early years and had also suffered from gonorrhea once. Although he had been cured, his reproductive function was excessively damaged. After marriage, he suffered from premature ejaculation and impotence, and his sexual performance was weak. He knew that his happiness was completely gone and the joy of family life had disappeared completely. He was introduced by a friend to seek treatment from me. (Treatment process) – In addition to advising him on health maintenance and a life of purity and few desires, I gave him electrotherapy for fifteen minutes every day, and he took three German testicle essence tonic pills "Bu Ti Kang" for men three times a day. Before going to bed, he took one German nocturnal emission special medicine "Nairis Spermatorrhea Tablets". After less than three months of treatment, all the diseases disappeared. According to a telegram he sent yesterday, his wife has become pregnant and is currently waiting for delivery in a certain obstetrical hospital.</p>
<h3>A New Comet in the Realm of Gonorrhea Treatment</h3>
<p>— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, Doctor of Medicine, USA</p>
<p>In recent years, various treatments for gonorrhea have sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain, leaving people dazzled and unsure of what to do. However, based on my years of treating gonorrhea, I am now more successful and confident than before. This is because my understanding of the anatomy of gonorrhea is based on scientific and experiential distinctions, and there are also special medicines available to give us great assistance.</p>
<p>Speaking of the invention of special medicines, it is not accidental. Since the contagiousness of gonorrhea is extremely strong, once infected, it is like a vengeful ghost following you, never to be escaped. However, since the invention of "New Clinon," this type of virus has a fundamental solution. Therefore, before the invention of "New Clinon," patients simply had no way to escape their own suffering. Every time they contracted leucorrhea, it would turn from acute to chronic, and from chronic to deterioration. The toxicity of a person's deteriorated gonorrhea is like glue and lacquer, and it is forever difficult to resolve. Moreover, dangers arise in succession. Mild cases may result in loss of fertility, and a withered and desolate state. Severe cases may result in loss of life. Therefore, these patients must not be taken lightly. Governments of various countries, recognizing that gonorrhea can weaken the health of the nation, have encouraged scientists, hoping to invent a special medicine. Under the incentive of heavy rewards, there was indeed a brave man. German Dr. Peter first invented "Clinon," and recently improved it using the latest chemotherapy preparations to invent "New Clinon" (available at Taihe Pharmacy). After taking it, it can completely eliminate all gonorrhea bacteria everywhere, leaving no residue to cause future troubles. Thus, "New Clinon" has become known to medical professionals in various countries around the world as a new comet in the realm of gonorrhea treatment. Its fame is comparable to the German Lion Brand syphilis special medicine "606." Regardless of whether it is newly onset or chronic leucorrhea, taking "New Clinon" can produce an anti-gonorrheal effect in the shortest possible time, with absolutely no adverse reactions. This is very different from the general chemotherapies on the market. Since the invention of "New Clinon," all newly onset, unbearably painful acute leucorrhea, and long-term, incurable old leucorrhea, have been effective with "New Clinon." A complete cure can be absolutely guaranteed. This is what I have proven through many years of comparing it with general gonorrhea medications.</p>

<h3>Saving Grace After Gonorrhea Complications</h3>
<p>How Complications Arise, How to Diagnose</p>
<p>The pathogens of gonorrhea have the fastest reproduction rate. Once they enter the human body, they immediately strive to destroy the healthy tissues of the patient. Gonococcal toxins exert an infiltrative effect, which occurs when toxins produced by gonococci attach to healthy tissues, causing infiltration and inflammation, and producing secretions that flow out of the urethra, which is what we call leucorrhea. At the beginning, the infection is limited to the anterior urethra, but it often spreads from the anterior urethra to the posterior urethra, and from the posterior urethra into the bladder, causing cystitis and nephritis. From the posterior urethra, it spreads into the prostate, causing prostatitis, seminal vesiculitis, epididymitis, and orchitis. Furthermore, there may be gonococcal blood circulation, leading to arthritis. All of these are complications of gonorrhea and must be diagnosed using scientific methods.</p>
<p>Special Treatments for Complications</p>
<p>After the complications of gonorrhea have been clearly diagnosed using scientific methods, the appropriate treatment should be used. Among these, the most all-encompassing therapy is the latest gonorrhea chemotherapy preparation "New Clinon" (available at China-West, Zhengwei Pharmacies), which has the most superior efficacy. This is because "New Clinon" is based on a bactericidal and anti-gonorrheal force, and contains no reactive ingredients. Therefore, after taking "New Clinon," it can completely eliminate all gonococci existing in the body. I also use the latest German-invented induced electrostatic therapy and German anti-gonococcal serum alternately, so that any complications of gonorrhea can be completely cured within a specified period. As for leucorrhea in women, they can also take "New Clinon" and use "Karl Sheedi Vaginal Suppositories" as suppositories, so that the discharge stops and the turbidity clears, and they can be spared the suffering of repeated infections. Consultation Hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, 20 patients will be seen each day, and each number will cost only five corners.</p>
<h3>Secret for Suppressing Cough and Lung Health: Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</h3>
<p>Whether it is traditional Chinese medicine or Western medicine, cough is considered a difficult disease to treat. Therefore, lung diseases are more numerous than any infectious disease, and their mortality rate is indeed alarming. Therefore, the general public should not think that a cold and cough is a minor illness and not treat it. If, unfortunately, an untreated cough turns into lung disease, the patient should not be pessimistic. In fact, lung disease is not as terrible as generally said by medical professionals. As long as health maintenance and treatment are proper, there is nothing mysterious about it. According to my experience, the medicine "Bu Fei Na Ning" has a particularly effective effect on suppressing cough and lung health. Regardless of whether the condition has reached the second or third stage of hemoptysis, it can be completely cured by taking this medicine. However, during the treatment period, it is advisable to rest quietly and avoid exertion, and to consume more nutritious foods, so that the disease is easier to cure. This is the condition for the inevitable cure of pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting Resumes Around Pingxi; Japanese Troops Occupy Coal Mine Center Area; Eighth Route Army Has Reached Huairou</h3>
<p>The North China correspondent for the Zi Lin Bao reported from Beijing on March 26th: The food situation here has appeared to ease in the past two weeks. The price of flour, which had risen to as much as 22 yuan per bag, has now fallen to around 18 yuan. Winter is over, and coal prices have also fallen sharply, but the cost of living is still at least twice what it was a year ago.</p>
<p>Whether the food situation can continue to improve is still uncertain. Judging from the current situation, the authorities have not taken steps to ensure that food continues to be shipped from Tianjin. However, if this is not done, the situation will inevitably worsen again, because the famine in southern Hebei is extremely severe, and there will be no food supply from there to this area. Although Beijing has this depressing situation, the shops outside Qianmen and in Dong'an Market are still open for business, and many of the goods are</p>
<p>shipped from Japan. The above is because the Japanese spend recklessly, because they do not trust "Lian Jun" currency and can buy whatever they want in North China, unlike the restrictions they face in their own country. However, the Japanese side imposes restrictions at home, but allows goods to be shipped to North China. The currency they obtain is at most another form of Japanese yen. Japanese economists do not know how to explain this policy. The atmosphere of prosperity in Beijing is not to be relied upon. This city is like a small island in a raging fire, with the flooded plains of central Hebei to the south, severe famine, and the guerrilla forces and Japanese troops resuming fierce fighting in the mountainous areas. Military operations had once been suspended. The Japanese army has apparently abandoned its attempt to pacify the western mountainous area. The Eighth Route Army is also temporarily not attacking the Japanese army, but is concentrating on organizing the rural areas.</p>
<p>However, earlier this month, Japanese troops entered the western mountainous area, harassing the Hun River valley all the way from Mentougou. Other Japanese troops moved south from the Pingzhang Railway. The Japanese army had previously occupied the coal mine center area of Zhaizhang several times, but had always abandoned it. The headquarters of the Eighth Route Army is also located there at times. This time, the Japanese army occupied Zhaizhang again, and it is said that they intend to stay there for a long time to control the area and open up the road between Mentougou and Zhaizhang. The Japanese side apparently intends to extend the railway from Mentougou by more than fifty li to reach Zhaizhang, and has already begun surveying. However, Zhaizhang is located in a vast area. If the Japanese army wants to occupy it for a long time and maintain its transportation westward from Mentougou, it must use heavy troops. Judging from the repeated artillery and bombing sounds heard west of Mentougou in recent days, it seems that the Japanese are encountering</p>
<p>major difficulties in maintaining this line. Fighting is also constantly occurring in the mountainous areas west of the Pinghan Railway and around Liulihe, especially at the western ends of the three branch lines of the Tuoli, Zhoukoudian, and Gecunzhang railways. In some places, the Japanese army is under great pressure and has to send troops from Baoding and other places along the railway to reinforce them. It is also reported that the Eighth Route Army has penetrated deep into the northwest and has reached</p>
<p>Huairou on the Pingre Railway. It is not yet clear why the fighting in that area has only just begun. This may be related to the anti-Communist movement in this city in recent weeks. If so, then this is a change of policy. At the end of last year, the Japanese army seemed to have stopped penetrating deep into the mountainous areas to avoid repeating the loss of both men and money, and took a defensive posture. The guerrillas have been silent for many months and have decided to take the offensive. There must be reasons for this that outsiders do not know.</p>
<h3>Opening of the Fifth Congress of the Chinese Medical Association; Dates: April 2nd to 5th; Venue: Jinbi Park, Kunming</h3>
<p>A Kunming correspondent reports that the Fifth Congress of the Chinese Medical Association will be held in Kunming from April 2nd to 5th, with Yunnan Chairman Long Yun serving as honorary chairman. However, due to transportation inconveniences, the number of attending representatives will not be as high as in previous years. However, it is reported that doctors from various places are going to Kunming to attend the meeting, including those from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hainan, He Kou, as well as Chengdu, Chongqing, Guiyang, and other provinces. Although the attendees from each region are only one or two people, in practice, every medical center has a representative attending. As for well-known representatives from abroad, there are delegations of doctors from France and Annam, and members of the US State Department of Health who are currently surveying disease conditions along the Yunnan-Burma Road. It is reported that the meeting's discussions will focus on wartime medical relief, public health, and medical education. In terms of public health, the topics to be discussed will focus on three main issues: county health, cholera, and malaria. The Central Pharmaceutical Chemistry Research Institute has prepared a report based on recent survey results on plants produced in Yunnan Province that can be used to make anti-malarial drugs, for reference. Furthermore, the presidents of various medical schools will present improvement issues in medical education for discussion at the congress. To avoid air raids, the congress has arranged each process in accordance with a new plan. Sightseeing and tours will take place before 3:00 PM each day, and meetings will be held after 3:00 PM. All sightseeing locations, banquet dates, and "Notes for Representatives" have been prepared. It is reported that Kunhua Hospital will provide its newly completed provincial medical center conference hall in Jinbi Park as the congress venue. Yunnan University will also provide newly built school buildings for representatives to lodge in. Major pharmaceutical companies from abroad and locally are preparing to display various medical products. Local hospitals, schools, medical groups, and provincial and municipal government authorities will take turns hosting public banquets for congress representatives. The sightseeing and tour locations for the representatives are said to be the Central Epidemic Prevention Office in Xishan, the Zhongzheng Medical College in Bailongtan, the Daguan Pavilion in Kunming, as well as various hospitals and universities. This congress of the Medical Association can be held during this extraordinary period, bringing together famous medical figures and scholars from across the country to discuss and promote their efforts, which will certainly contribute to academic development.</p>
<h3>Failure of Japanese Troops in Eastern Guangdong to Invade Westward; Attempt to Invade Raoping and the Fujian Border Again</h3>
<p>A Shantou correspondent reports that the Japanese army suffered a disastrous defeat in their invasion of Jiayang. On March 14th, the Chinese army crossed the Da Sangpu Mountain and controlled the Nan Duan of the Chaoshan Railway; Shanbu, Huamei, and Caitang cities, restoring the positions they had before March. Those advancing from the Jieyang Highway also recovered Fengxi, Guxiang, and Qiding Mountain, and approached Chaoan City. However, Shantou is one of the important commercial ports in South China. Although the Japanese army failed to invade westward, they are still unwilling to give up Chaoshan. After the 15th, reinforcements of 3,000 men continued to arrive. Japanese warships have also greatly increased in the north and south ports of Chenghai and the Chaoshan sea area, with about 50 or 60 ships. There is a tendency to invade eastward to Raoping and the Fujian border. Six Japanese warships are anchored in the sea off Nan'ao Island. On the 17th, near Waisha outside Chenghai, six giant battleships arrived, as well as three cruisers, armored speedboats, armed fishing boats, etc., moving back and forth along the coast of the Fujian-Guangdong border, which is very busy. The Japanese puppet troops on Nan'ao Island have all been transferred to Chenghai City, with the intention of taking advantage of the spring high tide season to make another attempt to invade up the river.</p>
<p>The office of the ×th Group Army of the Chinese Army stationed in Fengshun received coastal intelligence on the 18th and immediately sent three groups of staff officers to Jieyang, Chaoyang, Raoping, Chenghai, and the border between Fujian and Guangdong, to step up the defense of riverbanks and ports, deploy mobile water mines, and prohibit sailboats and ferries from approaching the occupied areas. Troops were also sent to monitor the three Japanese strongholds of Chao'an, Anbu, and Chengzhen to restrain the Japanese army from moving and concentrating.</p>
<p>The Advance Guard of the Hua Zhenzhong Brigade of the Chinese Army crossed Xigang, Guishan, and Xiapu Mountain on the 14th, recovered Da Sang Mountain, Wugang, Shaxitou, and Da Huangken area. The Japanese side was panicked and firmly defended Hong'an Township, building a three-layer barbed wire fence outside the township, connected to electricity. Five mortars were erected on the towers above the village gate to prevent the Chinese army from attacking. However, now that Sangpu Mountain had fallen into the hands of the Chinese army, they could overlook the Hong'an Township railway line and know that the Japanese army was weak. Therefore, they adopted a mobile strategy, avoiding the strong and attacking the weak. On the night of the 14th, they detoured through Xiao Huangken, Tianxin, and other places, and launched a fierce attack on the outskirts of Anbu, killing their way into Wenli and Neiyang. The Japanese troops stationed in Hong'an, Caitang, and Huamei did not dare to fight, but fired indiscriminately into the wilderness until dawn. That night, the Chinese army stormed into Anbu and Malang, annihilating more than 100 Japanese puppet troops, before safely retreating to Pannanshan Guolong. On this day, the Chinese army won a small victory on the southern section of the railway.</p>
<p>There were also fierce battles on the northern section of the railway on the 14th. The Japanese army took the offensive, and the Chinese army took the defensive. The Goto Unit of the Japanese army was determined to occupy Fengxi, Yuntishan, Guxiang, and Qiding Mountain to protect Chaoan City. On the morning of the 14th, more than 600 Japanese troops, accompanied by cavalry, artillery, and aircraft, suddenly attacked the above-mentioned locations, firing about 600 shells. There were not many Chinese troops stationed there, and they relied entirely on the assistance of strong men who ambushed in the fields, firing from all directions, making the Japanese army unclear about the situation and unable to determine where the Chinese army's formal defense line was. The Japanese army was discouraged and retreated to Chihu and Fuyang around 3:00 PM. Only a few dozen shops remained in Guxiang, Fengxi, and Yuntishan, which were razed to the ground that day. On the morning of the 16th, Japanese cavalry set out from Yixi outside the north gate, wanting to storm into the Guihu Denrong area. As soon as they reached Zhuxiang, they were ambushed by the Chinese militia. In this battle, the Japanese army used cavalry as the main force. Every time they attacked, they would use Mongolian tall horses as the vanguard. Japanese soldiers rode on horseback, firing light machine guns, with sharp, unmatched curve-edged long knives at their waists. The Chinese army did suffer a lot at the beginning of the engagement. However, although the cavalry was fierce, the shooting target was also large, and the Chinese army had learned from experience. Every time they saw the location where the Japanese shells landed, they knew that as soon as the shelling stopped, a group of warhorses would rush towards the landing site. They could prepare in advance by tying hemp ropes with leaves and fragrant grass, forming a spider web, and binding them to large stones. The hemp ropes were one foot above the ground. When they saw dust flying in the distance, the Chinese soldiers and civilians would immediately scatter and lie down on the ground, covering themselves with grass bundles to hide and not be identified. When the cavalry ran up, the hemp ropes would trip the horses, causing the horses and men to fall and pile up. The Chinese army would then attack from the ground, each time achieving the desired effect. Therefore, the Japanese cavalry, since then, would warn each other every time it was dusk or there were messy grasses on the ground, not to step over it. In the battle of Zhuxiang that day, as the Japanese cavalry fell to the ground, the Chinese army was encircling and annihilating them. The Japanese artillery on the Hanshan side fired across the river to provide support, and more than 100 Japanese troops were killed. On the 16th and 17th, Japanese puppet troops gathered in Chaoan City. Fengxi, Hongling, and Guxiang turned into a tug-of-war, gaining and losing three or four times, with seven or eight hundred casualties. The Chinese army retreated voluntarily. On the 18th, the Japanese army occupied all the strongholds in the northwest suburbs, and the situation in Chao City stabilized slightly. That night, the Japanese army crossed Xiangzi Bridge, holding electric lights, the light flickering on the surface of the Han River. Eight hundred cavalrymen moved to Dongjin, with the intention of attacking Raoping Gap along the Fenghuangshan Highway. The Japanese troops in Anbu and Shantou also moved to Chengzhen, their military edge pointing directly at the Raoping Fujian border. Judging from the movements of the Japanese army's sea and land forces, it can be predicted that the Japanese army is heading east, and there will soon be a fierce battle on the Fujian border.</p>
<h3>Relief Efforts of the Fujian Provincial Relief Association Over the Past Year; Nine Factories Have Been Established; Land Reclamation Work Has Also Been Implemented</h3>
<p>A Fuzhou correspondent reports that since its reorganization and establishment in January of last year, the Fujian Provincial Relief Association, in addition to passively providing shelter and repatriation for righteous people, evacuating the public, providing air raid relief, and soliciting winter clothing for righteous people, has achieved considerable results. On the active side, it has established righteous people's factories, with the aim of integrating relief with production. Those among the able-bodied righteous people who have technical skills or may be able to learn technical skills are sent to the righteous people's factories to engage in production work. There are currently nine established righteous people's factories: The first factory is a weaving factory, with a capital of 20,000 yuan, specializing in weaving cloth, and can accommodate more than 200 people. It currently only accommodates 130 people. The second factory is a camphor factory, with a capital of 5,000 yuan, specializing in the production of camphor oil, an essential raw material for military and medical needs, and currently accommodates more than 30 righteous people. The third factory is a brick and tile factory, with a capital of 11,500 yuan, specializing in the production of bricks and tiles, essential materials for construction, and currently accommodates more than 180 righteous people. The fourth factory is a towel factory, with a capital of 8,000 yuan, specializing in the production of white towels and blankets, and currently accommodates more than 50 righteous people (all women). The fifth factory is a sanitary materials factory, with a capital of 47,000 yuan, specializing in the production of gauze, absorbent cotton, adhesive bandages, and first aid kits, and currently accommodates more than 160 righteous people. The sixth factory is a hat and mat factory, with a capital of 5,000 yuan, specializing in the production of military-use bamboo hats, straw mats, and straw sandals, and currently accommodates more than 50 elderly, weak, and women. The seventh factory is a soap factory, with a capital of 7,500 yuan, specializing in the production of soap and candles, and currently accommodates more than 100 righteous people. The eighth factory is a spinning factory, with a capital of 10,000 yuan, specializing in spinning various cotton yarns, and is currently in the final stages of preparation. The ninth factory is a knitting factory, with a capital of 8,000 yuan, specializing in the production of undershirts, socks, and sanitary clothing, and currently accommodates more than 50 righteous people. The above factories are all located in safe areas in northwestern Fujian, which can not only avoid air raids, but also prosper the inland areas, and use local agricultural raw materials to manufacture daily necessities for the people, further strengthening the economic offensive against the blockade. As for the righteous people's land reclamation work, it is also progressing very actively. There are now reclamation offices in seven counties, including Chong'an, Jianning, Taining, Jianyang, Qingliu, Ningyang, and Dehua, with 1,293 reclaimed households, totaling 5,377 people, allocated 17,098 mu of wasteland, and 5,919 mu of reclaimed wasteland have been completed. In addition, the association is planning to establish a large-scale children's home in a certain county in western Fujian, accommodating 1,000 children evacuated from the war zone, implementing a half-work, half-study system, with a budget of 15,000 yuan for start-up costs and 10,000 yuan for monthly expenses, and has submitted a request to the provincial government for allocation to facilitate the opening.</p>
<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>Letter from All Members of the National Education Conference to the People of the Nation: Four Guidelines for Future Work</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Air Dispatch) All members of the National Education Conference from various provinces and cities recently issued a "Letter to the People of the Nation." The original text reads: "Our Chinese nation, under the leadership of the Premier, has resisted aggression and fought for survival with unyielding spirit and sincere unity. For three years, we have struggled arduously, and the final victory is already clearly indicated. However, resistance and national reconstruction must proceed simultaneously to complete the mission of national revival. Education is the foundation of all construction and the lifeblood of the nation. We must strive to promote and universalize it among all people. Only then can our Republic of China become a truly modern nation, and the Three Principles of the People can gradually be promoted to the world. The President has repeatedly and earnestly exhorted all educators in the country with this principle. The Ministry of Education, adhering to this intention, recently convened the National Education Conference of various provinces and cities in the capital. The significance is extremely important and great. We, the participants, were summoned to discuss the implementation of national education. We respectfully listened to the instructions of the President, the Minister, and other officials. We understood the clarity of national policies and rejoiced in the development of national fortune. We increasingly felt the weight of our responsibilities. After much inspiration, we felt compelled to make a statement to all compatriots in the nation, outlining a general plan to mobilize collective strength and gather diverse opinions, especially hoping for unity of purpose.</p>
<p>First, the implementation plan must be rigorous and complete, aiming for comprehensive promotion and maximum benefit. For any undertaking to achieve its predetermined goals, there must be a comprehensive plan. Education, as a century-long plan for the nation, is no exception. In the past, the nation faced many crises, and the education sector was not properly managed, leading to independent administrations, fragmentation, and duplication, resulting in limited effectiveness. The cause of this malady lies in either the planning being confined to one aspect or the implementation of the plan lacking thoroughness. This is what we must seriously address in the future implementation of national education, striving for rigorous planning and complete implementation.</p>
<p>Second, the administrative structure must be substantial and sound, aiming for flexible operation. Educational organization and political operation must be coordinated. As the relationship between institutions increases and the scope of work expands, even slight adjustments can cause obstruction. Even with good regulations, there will be no results. As the saying goes, "A difference of a hair's breadth can lead to an error of a thousand miles." Therefore, at the beginning of implementation, we must ensure the establishment of a sound structure and the appropriate coordination of personnel, so that everyone can fully utilize their talents and achieve effective results, and administrative operations can be as easy as using one's own arms.</p>
<p>Third, funding must be sourced reliably, aiming for completion as scheduled. As the opportunity for national education aims to be universalized among all people, the establishment of 600,000 schools in the first five years will require hundreds of millions of dollars. If the economic foundation is not secure, the implementation plan will be difficult to realize. Therefore, fundraising must be extensively diversified and should not cause hardship to the people. With a broad source of funding, there will be no risk of depletion. Without causing hardship to the people, the foundation can be considered solid. Then, we can strive for proper utilization, ensuring that every penny spent is effective and every penny invested brings benefit. Only then can everything be accomplished appropriately.</p>
<p>Fourth, the cultivation of teachers must emphasize both quantity and quality, aiming to set an example for the public. With 600,000 national schools, at least 1.2 million teachers are needed. Therefore, cultivating teachers is a major condition for implementing national education. The task of teachers is not only to be pioneers of national education but also to be the backbone of national reconstruction. Insufficient quantity will hinder implementation, while poor quality will pose a hidden danger to national reconstruction. Emphasizing both quantity and quality is essential. While expanding quantity is not difficult, achieving high quality is not easy. This is something that those responsible for cultivating teachers must pay close attention to. The above points are all essential plans for our future and conditions for the success of national education. We must carefully follow the President's instructions, firm our will, invigorate our spirit, dedicate our limited abilities, aspire to a century-long plan, and be diligent, courageous, faithful, and loyal to overcome difficulties and lay a solid foundation. We must also awaken the cooperation of people across the country, so that all citizens, regardless of wisdom or foolishness, wealth or poverty, can unite with one heart and contribute their wealth and efforts to the best of their abilities. Then, when national education is completed, it will be the day when the nation's fortunes flourish, the five thousand years of history can be glorified, and the four hundred million people can be revived. May all our compatriots understand this vision, share this aspiration, and act accordingly."</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Awards and Subsidizes Outstanding Young People from Poor Families</h3>
<p>Zhongzheng Scholarship established</p>
<p>(Chongqing Air Dispatch) The Ministry of Education, for the sake of outstanding young people from poor families across the country, to allow them to have the opportunity to receive higher education with the assistance of the state, and to commemorate the President's great achievements in resisting Japan and building the nation, plans to establish the Zhongzheng Scholarship for outstanding students from poor families in specialized schools and above, to aid aspiring scholars, inspired by the President's great personality, to further encourage their determination to cultivate virtue, improve their studies, and serve the country. The principles have been drafted and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, allocating 160,000 yuan in national currency, with a quota of 400 students. It is reported that the Ministry of Education is drafting detailed measures, which will be implemented during the summer vacation of this year. The "Principles for Establishing the Zhongzheng Scholarship for Outstanding Students from Poor Families in Specialized Schools and Above" are explored and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Zhongzheng Scholarship for outstanding students from poor families in specialized schools and above is 400 yuan, given on the condition of being from a poor family and having excellent grades. (2) Half of the scholarship quota will be determined by examination scores during the unified enrollment and independent enrollment of various schools each year, with the Ministry of Education approving the subjects. The other half will be selected by each school from the most outstanding students in school based on their academic performance and conduct, and determined by review. (3) Students who have received scholarships in previous years may continue to apply in the following year, but those with poor academic performance and conduct will be discontinued. (4) Students receiving scholarships may not enjoy loans, free tuition, public funds, or any other subsidies. (5) The application, review, and awarding of scholarships will be determined by the Ministry of Education's assessment methods, and a committee will be organized to handle it.</p>

<h3>Aurora Small Soccer League: Top Teams Participate, A Miniature of the Western Union Soccer League, Opening on the 13th of This Month</h3>
<p>The registration for the Second Aurora Cup Small Soccer League is surging. Although the competition stipulates a limit of 24 teams, divided into two groups, A and B, each group is further divided into two divisions, 1 and 2, with six teams in each division. As of yesterday, more than ten teams have registered, including Xifusi, Dongsailai A and B, Beixitong, Saint Francis, Sukeer, Dadou A and B, Jewish Association, Park Union, Hezibao, French Army, and Russian Overseas Association, accounting for three-quarters of the quota. The registration period is scheduled to end on the 5th of this month, and the competition will begin on the 13th, scheduled to end on the last Sunday (26th) of May. The Chinese and Western teams participating in this competition represent the essence of Shanghai, no less than a concrete version of the Western Union Soccer League, truly a great and exciting soccer game after the end of the soccer season. However, the absence of Tiren Team (the embodiment of Donghua), the champion of the previous (first) A Group, is slightly regrettable. However, Donghua players will play for teams such as Gelian and Aurora, still providing fans with the opportunity to enjoy. The competition rules are a single round-robin system. If possible for Group A, there is a hope to change it to a double round-robin system. In terms of trophies, Group A is for the Aurora Cup, and Group B is for the Shunji Cup. If there is sufficient time after the end of the league, one or two cup competitions will be held again, all following the example of the Western Union Association's Scott Cup. As for the league scoring, the winner gets two points, and a draw gets one point. Each participating team has seven players, namely one goalkeeper and one center-back, two defenders, and three forwards. The registration fee is 10 yuan for Group A and 5 yuan for Group B, with a deposit of 10 yuan.</p>

<p>The Issue of Self-Management in the Shanghai Market</p>
<p>The sources of turbulence in the Shanghai market appear to stem primarily from external pressure and the internal movement of idle capital. The most serious symptoms are speculative mania and runaway inflation. In the absence of political controls at this time, it seems that the only viable method is to implement self-management. Industry associations have been making efforts, but the effects have been minimal. Is this because the self-management system itself is ineffective, or because the techniques of self-management are flawed? As the authorities of both concessions are currently planning to balance prices in the city, we should make more contributions to cooperate and seek social welfare and the maintenance of national economy and the people's livelihood. This journal has chosen this as the topic of the third symposium (two previous ones have already been held), and invited experts to discuss it together yesterday. The attendees were Mr. Pan Hengqin, Mr. Pan Yangyao, Mr. Wang Haibo, and Mr. Wei Youfei, with Mr. Shen Wenbin taking notes. The insightful remarks and great theories were quite rewarding. The conference minutes will be published in the next issue of this journal. In addition, we have also received two pieces of written opinions from Mr. Pan Hengqin and Mr. Lu Gaoyi, the Price Committee Member of the French Concession Public Works Bureau. Here, we will first publish the summary of the topics and written opinions, and welcome all sectors to also express their opinions. This journal will fully publish them within the possible scope.</p>
<p>(1) Can market self-management bear the important responsibility of stabilizing the Shanghai market?</p>
<p>(2) Market management is successful, and the citizens will benefit greatly, needless to say. But under what kind of purpose will the industrial and commercial sectors also be happy to self-manage? (Because if the industrial and commercial sectors are unwilling, or the reasons for their unwillingness are too great, or there are too many and too widespread unwilling elements, then the resistance to its implementation will be great, and the effect will be small. Then what is the reason for their unwillingness?)</p>
<p>(3) The current self-management implemented in various industries is obviously ineffective; what is the reason?</p>
<p>(4) Self-management and self-supervision should be complementary; but how should they be carried out?</p>
<p>(5) How should self-management and self-supervision of idle capital be carried out effectively?</p>
<p>(6) How should self-management and self-supervision of prices be carried out effectively?</p>
<p>(7) What are the most difficult problems to solve in the current self-management in various industries?</p>
<p>(8) Consumers and producers and sellers must cooperate in self-management and self-supervision; but how should they cooperate effectively?</p>
<p>(9) How should the implementation agency of an ideal self-management system be composed?</p>
<h3>One of the Written Opinions</h3>
<p>— Lu Gaoyi</p>
<p>1. The motivation for self-management is nothing more than (1) conscience; (2) public opinion sanction. But these two motivations only have moral responsibilities; so-called Moral Obligation, and lack the coercive force of law; therefore, the results of self-management are difficult to have better results.</p>
<p>2. The market is composed of both supply and demand, or it is coordinated by both production and sales; therefore, the power of self-management must be able to reach both production and sales; otherwise, it will be difficult to see results.</p>
<p>3. The relationship between the market and other things is even more complicated, so even if there are gentlemen who are enthusiastic about self-management within their own positions, they cannot prevent external restrictions, and once they encounter them, they have no way to solve them. What's more, even for self-management within their own positions, it is not easy to manage well because of the complexity of the elements?</p>
<p>4. Therefore, I think that unless the scope of self-management can be expanded to the point of self-sufficiency, it can be effective; otherwise, it will be difficult to be effective. However, it must be said that it is better to have something than nothing, although the effect is not great, we may still promote it; because the responsibility of morality, although not as effective as the law, is always a little good. As for wanting to solve the current turmoil in the Shanghai market through self-management, it is inevitable to be extravagant hope.</p>
<h3>Two of the Written Opinions</h3>
<p>— Pan Hengqin</p>
<p>(1) The best way to stabilize the Shanghai market is for the government to come forward to control it, but the current situation in Shanghai is special. Apart from the government's power, the second best method is self-management of the market, which is more effective, and under the current situation, only the technology of promoting self-management of the market can achieve the purpose of stabilizing the market.</p>
<p>(2) If the industrial and commercial sectors are to be willing to implement self-management, they must find ways to eliminate their purpose of single-mindedly seeking profit. In other words, the industrial and commercial sectors should take loving the country and loving society as their purpose. If the market can be stabilized, then indirectly it is not only reducing their own living burden, but also gaining the praise of social figures and government authorities.</p>
<p>(3) The reasons why self-management in various industries is obviously ineffective: (1) The concept of selfishness and profit-seeking is too deep, (2) The organization of the association may not be perfect, (3) Favoritism and private affairs, (4) No way to report, (5) No way to sanction.</p>
<p>(4) Self-management should indeed be complemented by self-supervision. The method is to take the industry association as the unit of management. Various industries should supervise each other, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce should especially seriously take on the task of supervision. In other aspects, especially the media should launch public opinion sanctions, journalists should investigate and interview as much as possible, and report and disclose in detail. For individuals or people in the industry who come forward to the news media, chambers of commerce, and associations to report and expose, they should be guaranteed not to reveal their names.</p>
<p>(5), (6) (1) The financial sector should step up cooperation and strictly refuse to do or urge the redemption of speculative commodity mortgages, (2) The financial sector should reduce its dealings with speculative merchants and banks, (3) Make every effort to increase warehouse rent.</p>
<p>(7) The biggest difficulty in current self-management is that the fixed price is not easy to implement, and the black market is not easy to prevent. In fact, it is still regrettable that the association itself lacks the power of sanctions and lacks the courage and determination.</p>
<p>(8) The points that production and sales parties should cooperate: (1) In this extraordinary period, it is necessary to vigorously implement the thrift movement, (2) Reduce the consumption of secondary products, such as rice prices are very high, then less production of alcohol and pastries (because their raw materials are white rice or glutinous rice), so that the necessary diet can be maintained, (3) Consumers should not buy and store large quantities, (4) Organize consumer cooperatives, such as the cooperative of the Yinqian industry association, and the group purchase of rice by the people's food adjustment association, (5) When consumers buy, if they find that merchants are suspected of speculative hoarding, they should try to hold evidence to report and expose.</p>
<p>(9) Try to draft a chart of the ideal self-management agency as follows:</p>

<p>The Chamber of Commerce and associations should include social figures and one or two members of the Public Works Bureau, and the associations should also supervise each other.</p>
<h3>On the Decline in Price of Foreign Rice and Its Prospects</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zongyu</p>
<p>The price of goods is determined by the relationship between supply and demand. Generally, when supply is plentiful and demand is low, prices are sure to be cheap. Conversely, when demand is high and supply is scarce, prices are sure to be high. This is an immutable law of supply and demand for goods, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign. The principle of equalizing supply and transport is nothing more than this. However, today, things are abnormal, and the more goods flood in, the higher the prices become. Prices rise early and are expensive at night, and the sharp rise is irresistible. Is the iron law of supply and demand no longer credible? This is not the case! This is the result of temporary speculative manipulation, not a factual overturning of the theory! Because it is a consequence of speculation, it is extremely unreasonable. Therefore, the rise is swift, and the fall is rapid, like a flash in the pan, and it will not be long-lasting. Looking at the recent foreign rice market at sea, it is indeed so!</p>
<p>When the new year's market opened on a bullish note, people were excited, and everyone thought that the purchasing power of legal tender would further decline this year. Accumulating currency was not as good as accumulating grain, and they scrambled to buy, while old hoarders insisted on not selling. Exchange rates tightened; foreign firms quoted higher prices. All kinds of stimuli caused prices to soar, such as Saigon No. 1, which jumped from a closing price of 43 yuan last year to an opening price of 48 yuan. In less than five days (February 16), it soared to a peak of 53 yuan! Afterwards, profit-taking surged, and the price retreated to within 50 yuan, forming a hovering state. In less than half a month, at the beginning of this month, the price gradually declined. By the 21st of this month, Saigon No. 1, for example, opened at only 38 yuan! A precipitous drop! Such speed is indeed the result of manipulators and speculators eating their own bitter fruit, and is not to be regretted! I dare to describe the reasons for the price drop.</p>
<p>(1) Goods Arrive in a Rush, and Money Supply Cannot Circulate: The ordering of foreign rice is a futures transaction. It only requires paying a deposit to the foreign firm to place an order. Initially, this deposit was half the price of the goods, but later it was reduced to 30%. Merchants dealing in miscellaneous grains rarely have strong capital. Previously, some had poured all their resources into ordering foreign rice, originally intending to sell their goods on the way as soon as the market price rose. However, because the red market was too high, it triggered profit-taking by long positions, and the price was unable to rise. It either hovered or slightly waited and watched, and the price fell even more. The rice that had been ordered had already arrived at the port, and there was no strength to take delivery. Bank loans could not be obtained, so they had to reluctantly sell at a loss one after another! Few had the capital to take delivery. Therefore, the more goods arrived, the more frantic the selling, and the lower the price fell!</p>
<p>(2) Reports of Looser Conditions in the Producing Areas: Although the exchange rate has shrunk today, because foreign firms' representatives sell at discounted prices in the producing areas, the asking price is so cheap that they do not notice the shrinkage of the exchange rate. Therefore, the new transaction price is lower than the current market price. Those with good intentions are eager to order cheaply, hoping that the exchange rate will shrink further and the producing price will rise to make a profit. With so many orders placed, it affects people's minds, and dumping becomes more prevalent.</p>
<p>(3) Abundant Stock, Sluggish Sales: According to unofficial statistics, the current stock of rice in Shanghai is about one million bags, and goods are still congested on the way. Therefore, there is extremely abundant stock, but sales are more sluggish than before. Since the cost of living in Shanghai has become extraordinarily high, the population has declined, from about five million to four million. Previously, 10,000 bags of rice were needed every day, but now 8,000 bags are enough. Furthermore, middle- and upper-class families have accumulated several months' worth of grain, and some have even accumulated a year's worth of grain. Now that they see the price falling, they are even less likely to continue buying, which has a considerable impact on local sales.</p>
<p>(4) Domestic Rice Arrives in Shanghai Daily: Last year, the whole country had a bumper harvest, and there was no shortage of rice. However, the Japanese and puppet regimes blocked the source, resulting in the world of foreign rice. Now, Changshu and Wuxi domestic rice arrive at the port daily, although the number is not large (even during the Qingming holiday, 6,000 to 7,000 bags arrived!). However, it is better than nothing. Moreover, Chinese people seek domestic rice, and foreign rice is naturally affected.</p>
<p>(5) Government and Group Purchases: Since the soaring rice prices, factories and groups have successively placed direct orders, which has also had a considerable impact on actual sales. Moreover, government relief for the destitute and small retail sales have decreased, which has an impact on rice merchants' psychology.</p>
<p>(6) Government Sale of Flour: In addition, the recent government sale of flour has led middle- and lower-class families to switch to flour. Although the number is not large, it still affects actual sales!</p>
<p>(7) Increased Warehouse Rent: Recently, there is another major reason, that is, the Roosevelt Warehouse, which has always been the main base for storing rice, has recently suddenly increased warehouse rent, changing one period to two periods. Some argue that the increase in warehouse rent will increase the cost of rice merchants, who will pass it on to consumers. Then why is it a major reason for the decline in rice prices? In fact, they only know one thing but not the other. The price is bound to fall as goods arrive in a rush. If they insist on not selling, they will increase their losses, so they must sell as soon as possible. If they want to transfer to another warehouse, the warehouses in the concession have long been congested by other hoarded goods. Even if some can be transferred, the number is small. If they store the rice in warehouses outside the concession, they are afraid of problems when selling the rice in the future, so rice merchants dare not try it.</p>
<p>Today, the decline in the price of foreign rice is certain! What will its future trend be? According to my speculation, the price of rice will continue to trend downward, or at least hover downward. There will be no hope of rising. The reasons are:</p>
<p>(1) According to statistics reported on the 26th of this month, the stock of rice in Shanghai has reached more than one million bags. In addition, there are still 200,000 to 300,000 bags of ordered goods on the way! Even with this number, it is enough to last for half a year. Moreover, will there be no orders in the coming months? If foreign firms' asking prices depreciate again, there will be a large number of orders. With such a flood of sources, the price will naturally not be high.</p>
<p>(2) In recent months, domestic rice has arrived at the port daily, although the number is not large, the source does not seem to be interrupted. If the Japanese and puppet regimes can reduce obstacles, the congestion of arrivals will be no less than that of foreign rice. Chinese people have always liked domestic rice. At this point, they will abandon foreign rice and choose domestic rice. The actual sales of foreign rice will be seized, and its importance will be lost. Naturally, there will be no strength to rise.</p>
<p>(3) Since the cost of living at sea has become higher, the population is gradually decreasing. The current daily demand for 8,000 bags may be reduced to 5,000 to 6,000 bags in the future. With abundant stock and a flood of arrivals, can foreign rice still have the power to rise?</p>
<p>Looking at the above three reasons, the price of foreign rice should not rise again.</p>
<p>Some argue that "the rice price rebounded after the market opened after the 25th holiday, which is a sign of rising." In fact, this is not a sign of rising. Large rises and small dips, large dips and small rises, the changes in market prices form a curved line. Moreover, after several days of vacation, stores must replenish their supplies to meet sales. Therefore, the market price may be stimulated by this, but its momentum is only temporary, and it will soon decline. There is no need to overthink it.</p>
<p>"The exchange rate is shrinking day by day, which will affect the cost of ordering." This point seems right but is actually wrong. What is meant by the shrinking exchange rate refers to the US dollar exchange rate. If it is the French franc, it is very stable and has a tendency to lengthen. The exchange rate of the French franc is also very stable. Foreign rice comes from Saigon, Annam, Burma, etc. The exchange settlement is in British and French francs, not US dollars.</p>
<p>"The surge in orders will stimulate quotations in the producing areas." This point is also not worth worrying about. Saigon and other places have excessive production. The mere ordering of Shanghai is not enough to stimulate its market price. If there was a major flood in the country in the 19th and 20th years of the Republic of China, and the import of foreign rice reached six to seven million bags, did the producing areas therefore report higher prices? Is this not clear evidence?</p>
<p>"The European war has a tendency to prolong, and Britain and France may ban food exports." However, Saigon, Annam, and other places are located in the tropics and have excessive production. The government has no time to encourage exports, so how can there be a possibility of banning exports? If we talk about storing grain, they mainly focus on wheat, not rice.</p>
<p>Recently, the number of foreign rice transported to the north seems to be small, and the stock in Shanghai will therefore decrease. This point is also incorrect. Shanghai was originally a transshipment port for goods. Some northern merchants have agents stationed in Shanghai to place orders locally. If the Shanghai market price rises sharply, they will report sales in Shanghai. Otherwise, they will be transported to the north. Foreign goods imported through customs are usually given a grace period for merchants to wait for transshipment. Once foreign rice has been declared and imported, it is not allowed to be re-exported. This batch of rice transported to the north did not have a specific destination. Now, because the Shanghai market price is low, it is transported to the north, but it is not moved from Shanghai. If the Shanghai market price rises again, this batch of rice handled by the northern merchants will be reported for sale in Shanghai because it is not suitable for transport to the north. This batch of foreign rice is actually stabilizing the Shanghai rice price invisibly.</p>
<p>Merchants seek profit from their capital, buying cheap and selling expensive. This is an immutable principle, and I cannot bear to blame rice merchants alone. Food is the paramount concern of the people, and when it comes to this matter, if there is something that cannot be helped, I would like to offer some advice to rice merchants.</p>
<p>The country is currently fighting a bloody war. All of our merchants and people should be in the same boat, and speculation is inappropriate, especially when it comes to rice, which concerns the people's food. This sudden drop in the price of foreign rice is sure to cause losses to many, and those with weak capital will face bankruptcy! This is indeed the speculators reaping the consequences of their own actions, and is not to be regretted. The past is gone, but the future can be pursued. I hope that after receiving this lesson, rice merchants will from now on abandon the idea of manipulation, and you will see the cheers and blessings of all the citizens. Moreover, looking at past history, those who speculate in foreign rice have invariably suffered a complete defeat. Chinese merchants adhere to old methods and have no statistics on the amount of purchases and sales. Once they encounter a shortage of goods, they rush to order foreign rice. When the goods arrive in a flood, the price will inevitably fall and the loss is inevitable. I remember that during the great drought in Jiangnan in the 23rd and 24th years of the Republic of China, rice merchants rushed to order foreign rice. In a few months, three to four million bags of orders had arrived in Shanghai. However, in fact, this huge number was simply not needed, and the price fell sharply. Many rice merchants went bankrupt as a result. The lingering fear is still in my heart, but the old idea of speculation is revived. Rice merchants, please wake up! Moreover, ordering foreign food ultimately hurts the country's finances. Why not proceed to purchase domestic rice and find ways to open up its source? It is not only for the benefit of the merchants themselves, but also for the benefit of the country.</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Foodstuffs: Scouring for Rice Again</h3>
<p>The rice market has been showing a fatigued trend recently, but yesterday the phenomenon reversed, and the market turned from fatigue to tightness. Although the market was active in the morning, the result was fatigue and depression. Therefore, the morning market opened with hesitant buying and selling, and there were no transactions for a long time. Around 10 o'clock, the floating hoarders who had previously been selling began to dump again, and the asking price was very low. For example, small "Jiao" was only 38.5 yuan, which attracted inland merchants to buy. The first initial inquiry was 38.3 yuan, which was more than 1 yuan lower than the previous afternoon. At this point, sales gradually increased, and local stores continued to scour the market. The situation turned lively, and the asking price also rose accordingly, and the prices of various types of foreign rice gradually rose, recovering to their original levels. By noon, the sales channel was wider and the market was more lively. Therefore, at the close of the market, the price rose by about 0.5 yuan compared to the previous market. Saigon No. 1 was 44.5 yuan, No. 2 was 40 yuan, "Huo Jiao" was 43.5 yuan to 43 yuan, special "Luo" was 42 yuan, No. 2 was 40 yuan, small "Jiao" was 39.5 yuan, and Tokyo "Pian Jian" was 40 yuan. However, mixed broken rice and rice mung beans remained strong in the previous market, and the prices were unchanged. As for "Jing Nuo" domestic rice, the market price rose and fell once, but the result was also unchanged.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Domestic Shrimp Tails Arrive in a Rush; Down 20 Yuan from Before</h3>
<p>Recently, many shipments of shrimp tails have arrived, but sales are still good. For example, domestic products: Jiangbei "Kai Yang" sells for 130 yuan, Wenzhou "Kai Yang" sells for 148 yuan to 145 yuan, Yantai tails sell for 167 yuan, Tianjin port tails sell for 179 yuan, and Guanli tails sell for 160 yuan, which is about 20 yuan lower than the previous market.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sentiment in the sugar market remained good, and the trend continued to be tight. The association's listing price for spot 24 coarse white sugar rose by 0.2 yuan. The price in the "Ben Zhan" warehouse was 63 yuan, the price for new goods in the "Wai Zhan" warehouse was 62.9 yuan, and the price for old goods was 62.7 yuan. The price for transshipment goods was 49 yuan, unchanged. Taikoo car white sugar rose by 0.2 yuan to 0.4 yuan. The price for B mark in the West warehouse was 68.9 yuan, and the price in the East warehouse was 68.5 yuan. The price for OW mark in the West warehouse was 68.3 yuan, and the price in the East warehouse was 67.7 yuan. The price for OX mark in the West warehouse was 67.5 yuan, and the price in the East warehouse was 67 yuan. The price for DY mark in the East warehouse was 67 yuan, and the price in the West warehouse was 66.8 yuan. The price for HX mark in the West warehouse was 66.5 yuan, and the price in the East warehouse was 66.3 yuan. The price for H mark car red sugar also rose by 0.5 yuan. The price in the West warehouse was 46.5 yuan to 46.2 yuan, and the price in the East warehouse was 46 yuan. Dutch red sugar remained unchanged. The price for new goods WA mark was 50 yuan, the price for transshipment was 41 yuan. The price for special snow white sugar from the local factory was 62.5 yuan, the price for "Ben Bing" was 74 yuan, and the price for "Jing Ming Bing" was 76.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dried and Fresh Goods: Golden Vegetables Decline</h3>
<p>Recently, the market for golden vegetables has been quiet due to sluggish sales, and the market trend is downward. The listed prices are also very hesitant, so the market is gradually loosening. Currently, the price for top-grade vegetables is 45 yuan, and the price for subsequent grades ranges from about 40 yuan to 32-33 yuan. The market cannot recover until sales are active.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Transactions Are Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday was a regular weekly holiday, and foreign firms and banks were closed. There were no fixed arrivals of goods, and there was no room for monetary activity. As a result, although hardware stores were still open (most small hardware stores were closed in the afternoon), only retail customers were buying from "Men Zhuang," and there was nothing significant to mention in wholesale transactions. As a result, the prices of various goods did not change much. For example, the price for "Ben Ding" remained at 54 yuan, the price for bamboo-joint steel bars was 1,010 yuan, the price for black iron billets was 80 yuan, the price for double-linked tinplate was 190 yuan, the price for double-linked "Zheng Hao" tinplate was 215 yuan, the price for small tinplate was 115 yuan, the price for 24-gauge large tinplate was 1,000 yuan (spot goods are very scarce), the price for 26-gauge tinplate was 400 yuan, the price for new lead wire was 80 yuan, the price for white lead wire was 40 yuan, the price for yellow steel wire was 40 yuan, the price for American bar iron was 135 yuan, the price for "Hui Si" iron was 165 yuan, the price for blue lead iron was 140 yuan, the price for plain white iron 12 pounds was 9 yuan, the price for plain white iron 14 pounds was 11 yuan, and the price for horse-brand cement was 25 yuan.</p>
<h3>Textiles: Woolen Fabrics Show Obvious Price Increases but Hidden Fatigue</h3>
<p>Recently, the woolen fabric market, except for suit fabrics, mostly shows obvious price increases but hidden fatigue. Buyers are hesitant to purchase because actual sales are not strong, and most hoarders have shifted their thinking and want to sell, which makes the market even more fatigued. Today, the four major warehouses are eager to sell, and prices have been lowered accordingly. The price for 3,000 "Pailisi" has been reduced to 10.05 yuan per yard, the price for 456 wool "Mei Ren Hua Ni" has been fatigued to 10.025 yuan, the price for 559 "Si Ma Xiang Ru Yuan Zhi Gong Ni" is 18 yuan, the price for "Da Long Yi Er Ba Yang Cheng Pai Bo Bi Ji" is 9.25 yuan per yard, the price for "Da Hua Mu Yang Tu Han Li Meng" is 14 yuan, the price for yellow-edged white "Bi Ji" is 15 yuan, and the price for "De Da" is 12.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Imports and Exports: Soybeans and Tea Are Shipped to Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>On the 31st, soybeans were exported to Hong Kong (455 bags) and Singapore (2,565 bags). In addition, 65 pieces of tea were shipped to Hong Kong and 25 pieces were shipped to Singapore.</p>
<p>Also, 10 pieces of textiles were exported to Tianjin (previous day, 30th), 48 pieces were shipped to Yantai, 355 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, 275 pieces were shipped to Guangzhou Bay, 12 pieces were shipped to Haikou, and 615 pieces were shipped to Haiphong.</p>

<h3>Simplified Calculation Method for Excess Profits Tax During Extraordinary Times</h3>
<p>— Chao Jimei</p>
<p>The Excess Profits Tax During Extraordinary Times was promulgated by the Ministry of Finance on October 28, 1938, amended in October 1939, and levied from January 1, 1939. This firm (Datong Legal Accounting Firm) recognizes that various businesses feel that its calculation method is too complex and prone to errors. Now, as a remedy, we have specially created a simplified calculation table and five calculation steps. If you calculate together, you can save time and effort on multiple pages. Now, we will use three examples to illustrate as follows:</p>
<p>Simplified Calculation Table (Based on a Capital of 10,000)</p>
<p>(Example 1) If the company's capital is 10,000 yuan and the profit is 10,000 yuan, the method for calculating the excess profits tax payable is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) First, calculate the percentage of capital to profit (10,000 ÷ 10,000), which is 100%. According to Article 4, Paragraph 6 of the Excess Profits Tax Regulations, if the amount of profit exceeds 60% of the capital, 50% of the excess amount will be levied. Therefore, the following is calculated in two steps, that is, 60% of the profit and the part above 60%.</p>
<p>(2) Next, check the simplified calculation table under column "Yi" (i.e., 60% portion) for the cumulative tax number, which is 1,025 yuan.</p>
<p>(3) Multiply the capital by 60% (column Yi) to get 6,000 yuan. Then subtract 6,000 yuan from the profit of 10,000 yuan to get 4,000 yuan. This is the portion of the profit above 60%.</p>
<p>(4) Next, check the tax rate under column "Wu" in the simplified calculation table, which is 50%. Therefore, multiply 4,000 yuan by 50% to get 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(5) Add the 1,015 yuan from item 2 to the 2,000 yuan from item 4 to get 3,025 yuan. This is the total amount of excess profits tax payable.</p>
<p>(Example 2) If the company's capital is 20,000 yuan and the profit is 8,000 yuan, the method for calculating the excess profits tax payable is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) First, calculate the percentage of capital to profit (8,000 ÷ 20,000), which is 40%.</p>
<p>(2) Next, check the simplified calculation table under column "Mao" for the cumulative tax number, which is 225 yuan. Multiply this by 2 (because the capital amount in this example is 20,000 yuan, which is twice the capital amount in the table) to get 650 yuan, which is the total amount of excess profits tax payable. In this example, the percentage of capital to profit is an integer and is below 60%, so you only need to check the simplified calculation table to get the result (to be continued).</p>

<h3>The Tragedy After a Husband's Energy Declines: Wives Are Also Responsible...</h3>
<p>The phrase "unchecked human desires" is enough to describe the dynamics of today's society. A man, before he is married, fully intends to marry a healthy and beautiful woman to live a happy life with them. This is very common and should be the case, but after marriage, even after possessing a woman, he often still thinks it is not enough. According to psychologists, when a man's desires expand, it seems that he can accommodate several dozen women. This is not an exaggeration, and in fact there are such people. However, people with such ox-like and horse-like energy are too few after all. Most men are just deluded by temporary lust and take advantage of temporary desire, planting the seeds of endless pain later on!</p>
<p>The harm of debauchery is like constantly cutting the roots and trunk of a tree. Once the roots and trunk are broken, the tree must fall. When a man's debauchery reaches the point where he is exhausted, his life is also in danger. In addition, a young man's acts of masturbation, nocturnal emission, or early marriage, etc., are also greatly harmful to the body. Because semen is the endocrine fluid in our body's reproductive glands, including the pituitary gland, adrenal gland, testicle gland, and other valuable endocrine components. It is ductless and can directly irrigate the whole body through blood circulation. In addition to exciting love emotions and presiding over reproductive functions, it can also promote development, regulate metabolism, and nourish the brain, sex organs, spinal cord, and other nerves. Therefore, those who have committed masturbation, nocturnal emission, early marriage, or debauchery, causing the loss of endocrine fluid in the reproductive glands, will suffer from premature ejaculation, impotence, premature aging, incomplete development, brain decay, kidney deficiency, and other symptoms. When a man reaches this state of weakness, even a normal married life may feel beyond his ability, or he may even be completely unable to perform. If the wife also has expanding desires like the man, can she not hate him in her heart, become depressed, or seek other ways out, secretly engage in adultery, or righteously file for divorce from her husband? At this time, what is the pain in the husband's heart like!</p>
<p>However, wives also bear responsibility for their husbands' declining energy. If the husband is debauched, you should use your pillow talk to educate him and persuade him to love himself. If he unfortunately already suffers from the above-mentioned symptoms, you must urge him to seek treatment as soon as possible. Fortunately, the method of treatment is not difficult in today's medical advancement. However, aphrodisiacs and miscellaneous drugs should not be taken indiscriminately. You must take the most appropriate and effective reproductive gland hormone preparation, "Sheng Zhi Su", which can generate sperm, replenish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, and activate blood within one day and night after taking it. Continuous use can further promote development, nourish nerves, and regulate metabolism. It will surely cure various symptoms and increase energy in the short term. Regular use by middle-aged and elderly people can prolong life, rejuvenate, and return to youth. However, those suffering from nocturnal emission must also take the effective medicine "Ximi Bao Shi Gu Jing Pian" to stop the leakage, so that both the root and the symptoms can be treated, and the effect is even faster. Sincerely, this excellent medicine has valuable materials and definite efficacy. Since its invention in Germany more than 30 years ago, it has been popular all over the world and has a worldwide reputation. It is also sold in large Chinese and Western pharmacies and in the western medicine department of Wing On Company in this city. Millions of people who have taken this excellent medicine have regained their strength and re-enjoyed the happiness of love.</p>
<h3>The Consequences of Untreated Seminal Emission</h3>
<p>— Sex Disease Specialist Zhan Nian Zeng</p>
<p>Rather than saying youth is a golden age, it is better to say it is a dangerous turning point. Because the golden age is often just a memory of the past, while the dangerous turning point is cautiously advancing in the present!</p>
<p>Young people in the spring of their lives, with vigorous blood and weak reason, their desires burning intensely, and a bad environment constantly tempting them. With the slightest carelessness, they fall into the trap of masturbation and licentiousness. It should be known that masturbation and licentiousness most easily injure the sexual nerves, causing the sperm gate to relax, and thus most easily cause seminal emission.</p>
<p>Semen is the secretion of our reproductive glands, the source of our life. Even a single or occasional leakage of this source of life causes a significant loss to our body. If there are five or six or more than ten emissions in a month, how can our body not be greatly depleted? Consequently, the brain, sex, and spinal cord nerves gradually weaken, metabolism decreases, development stagnates, and symptoms such as brain weakness and forgetfulness, insomnia and palpitations, lower back pain, premature ejaculation and impotence, incomplete development, and premature aging will emerge. Such young people, even if they sit and eat all day, feel tired and weak, how can they strive hard and enjoy life in time? But time passes like a flying arrow, and spring will soon be gone again!</p>
<p>If you don't work hard when you are young, you will only regret it when you are old! Young men with seminal emission, do not waste your youth! According to our experience, seminal emission is not an incurable disease. If you take the special medicine "Schmidt's Sperm-Consolidating Pills," you can achieve the effects of sleep and stopping emission that night. This medicine is secretly prepared by Professor Schmidt, the German medical giant, and is indeed a sacred remedy for consolidating the sperm gate, stopping emission, and calming the nerves. However, if seminal emission has already caused the above-mentioned symptoms, it is necessary to also take "Reproductive Element," a preparation made from healthy animal reproductive glands, to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, nourish the nerves, and promote development. Taking it continuously for a month will surely cure all symptoms and restore perfect health. If patients can come to our clinic for diagnosis and treatment in person, a cure can be guaranteed.</p>

<h3>The Connection between Breast Beauty and Fertility</h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei</p>
<p>Encouraging childbearing and strengthening the body to prevent population invasion by neighboring countries is a major national policy of modern countries. "There are three unfilial acts, and having no descendants is the greatest," is the ethical concept of prosperous families in the past patriarchal society. In short, whether it is ethical concepts or modern national policies, they all consider the birth of sons and daughters to be important and worth promoting between couples. Although having sons and daughters is also related to men, the responsibility mainly falls on women. Therefore, if a woman cannot bear children, it is truly the greatest flaw, greatly affecting the reproduction of the nation and also destroying the love between couples, leading to a tragic life.</p>
<p>Why can't women bear children? This is entirely due to physiological diseases. In other words, the function of the reproductive glands, the ovaries, is destroyed by menstrual irregularities, vaginal discharge, malnutrition, heart weakness, and other symptoms, affecting metabolism. The most obvious example is that those with unhealthy ovarian function will inevitably have atrophied breasts, thin buttocks, and no curves. Although their faces may be covered with precious cosmetics, their appearance may seem as before, but their reproductive power will be lost. Even if they are fortunate enough to have children, the bodies of these infants are often very weak and difficult to grow up, ultimately leading to childlessness and lifelong regret! Therefore, Dr. Lu Xing, a famous gynecologist at the Baite Sheng Hospital in the United States, said: A woman's happiness in life and whether she has children depends on her breasts. If her breasts are high and elastic, not only will the love between the couple be strong and happiness endless, but the children born will also be healthy and lively. This is truly the result of experience. From the above, it can be seen that women with atrophied breasts should never be ignored and should be actively rescued. According to famous Chinese and Western gynecologists and my experience, taking the female reproductive gland endocrine preparation "Reproductive Element" is the most appropriate and effective. After taking it for one day and night, it can nourish ovarian function, promote metabolism, regulate menstruation, warm the uterus and stop vaginal discharge. Continued use will surely make the breasts high and enhance health and beauty in a short period of time.</p>

<h3>Gonorrheal Prostatitis</h3>
<p>The prostate gland is located in a crucial area of the internal reproductive organs. Some people with gonorrhea do not develop cystitis or orchitis, but no one escapes prostatitis. The only reproductive function of the prostate gland is to secrete prostatic fluid. This fluid must flow out with the semen during intercourse, as it is an essential element for nourishing sperm. Without sperm, there can be no fertility, but with sperm but no prostatic fluid, there is also no fertility, because sperm cannot survive without prostatic fluid.</p>
<p>From this perspective, gonorrheal prostatitis is the most easily encountered complication of gonorrhea and is also the symptom most likely to hinder fertility. Therefore, if a gonorrhea patient develops prostatitis, it is essential to prevent the destruction of reproductive function and quickly seek effective treatment to avoid adverse outcomes.</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of prostatitis, with the new scientific discoveries, the old purely local therapies have been abandoned. The purely old local therapy—local surgical therapy—is simply a monotonous prostate massage method, which cannot completely eliminate the gonococci hidden within the gland. Therefore, prostate massage alone has never cured prostatitis. I use the latest German "Lullimine" electrotherapy, directly inserted into the area adjacent to the prostate gland from the anus, applying the appropriate electrical current based on the severity of the condition, and supplemented with chemical therapy, which can cure the condition in a short period of time and guarantee fertility.</p>

<h3>Puppet Regime Controls Local Goods, Citizens' Lives Become More Difficult, Puppet Central Market Scheduled to Open Today, Goods from All Over Transported to Shanghai Have Been Intercepted</h3>
<p>The puppet "Central Market" is scheduled to officially open today, and all local goods transported to Shanghai will be intercepted from today onwards to be used as business items for the market. This will not only increase the burden on citizens but also cause business losses to local merchants and the unemployment of a large number of employees in the local goods industry. The detailed report is as follows:</p>
<p>Arrangement of the Puppet Market</p>
<p>Dozens of workers hired by the Japanese and puppet regimes have been working on the interior of the "market." All the equipment is now complete. Several wooden platforms have been set up in the two vegetable sheds for business use. There are also more than a dozen trucks in the market to transport the intercepted local goods. The building that used to be the Sihang Warehouse has also been cleaned up and used as an office and storage space. Anyone who wants to enter, except for a small number of local merchants who have a special "Yellow Card" pass issued by the "market," ordinary vegetable vendors must purchase a small "entry permit" on red paper for two cents to enter and exit freely. Those without an "entry permit" and "Yellow Card" special pass will still not be allowed to enter.</p>
<p>Interception of Local Goods</p>
<p>Since the "market" opened on the 23rd, incidents of Japanese and puppet regimes intercepting local goods transported to Shanghai from the occupied areas have occurred from time to time. According to sources from local merchants, in the past week, the total number of intercepted local goods has been no less than a thousand pieces. As the "market" is scheduled to officially open today, more than two thousand pieces of local goods were intercepted from various places yesterday. It is said that the Japanese and puppet regimes, in order to realize their ambition to completely capture all local goods transported to Shanghai, have increased personnel at various locations upstream of the Suzhou River, such as Caojiadu, Zhoujiaqiao, the North Station, the South Station, and upstream of the Huangpu River, such as Lannidu and Zhoujiadu, to intercept local goods transported to Shanghai, forcibly purchase them at low prices, and transport them to the "Central Market" to monopolize the profits.</p>
<p>The opening of the "market" is falsely claimed by the Japanese side to "reduce the burden on the people," but with its heavy taxes and cruel exploitation, its purpose of extracting the blood and sweat of citizens is clearly revealed. Currently, the taxes paid on local goods such as salted wax transported to Shanghai are already more than 20%. After the establishment of the "market," a commission of 1% will be levied on all those who have already paid taxes. It is said that 30% of this commission will be taken by the Japanese side, and 70% will be used as the "maintenance fee" for the "market." It is said that the price of local goods and salted wax in this city will increase due to the heavy taxes imposed by the Japanese side, which are more than 30%, and the burden on the citizens will be further increased.</p>
<p>Forcible Seizure</p>
<p>After the opening of the puppet "market," in addition to incorporating the vegetable market at the Toutuo of Wusong Road in Hongkou, the two local goods stores at Xinzhapu and Laozapu Bridges will also be forced to join. The businesses of the local goods stores usually have fixed buyers and fixed customers, and can earn a fixed commission. However, after joining the puppet "market," everything is subject to the "market's" restrictions, and there is absolutely no freedom to do business. They can only purchase goods from the "market" during auctions to make a living. Therefore, the commission that could have been earned can only be obtained in a very small amount, as most of it will be distributed to the Japanese and puppet regimes. Moreover, if they do not join the "market," they will have no place to obtain goods. Therefore, the owners of the local goods stores who have joined the "market" are all complaining bitterly. Although the business of the local goods stores at Xinzhapu and Laozapu Bridges will not be completely moved to the puppet "market" for the time being, under the covetous gaze of the Japanese and puppet regimes, it is feared that those places will not be able to escape their clutches. If that is the case, the aforementioned two markets will inevitably change. It is now heard that some local goods stores located there have already rented out their houses.</p>
<p>Unemployment is Feared</p>
<p>Each of the local goods stores employs many workers, with some having as many as fifty or sixty, and at least seven or eight. The total number of workers in the city is more than two thousand. Their salaries are usually low, and it is already difficult to make ends meet in these times of high living costs. According to a worker in the industry, after the establishment of the puppet "market," only fifty or sixty clerks and thirty workers will be needed in all the local goods stores if they are merged into the "market," and they have already been hired by the Japanese and puppet regimes. Therefore, some employees are already feeling the fear of unemployment. However, according to the customs of the industry, the dismissal of employees will be delayed until the Dragon Boat Festival.</p>
<h3>Saigon Rice Prices Fall by 10%, Foreign Rice Shipped Out in Large Quantities, Bean and Rice Industry and Miscellaneous Grain Industry Associations Advocate Raising Funds to Continue Price Stabilization</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Food Regulation Association has been holding meetings in recent days to discuss raising funds to clear out stockpiles, and the discussions have been quite lively. It is now known that after the association's chairman, Yu Qiaqing, acknowledged borrowing 50,000 yuan and the executive director, Guo Shun, acknowledged borrowing 60,000 yuan, other committee members have done their best to borrow from all parties. Also, after the association convened a joint meeting of treasurers on the 27th of last month and resolved to do so, it mortgaged some foreign rice to Jin Cheng Bank for 150,000 yuan. Therefore, the amount of more than one million yuan needed has exceeded more than half of the amount raised. In this way, large quantities of foreign rice stored in warehouses can be withdrawn one after another in the next few days. According to Saigon telegrams, rice prices there have fallen by another 10% compared to last week. Although China and Japan are both buying, there is still a downward trend. Therefore, rice prices in this port will fall day by day.</p>
<p>Anxiety Not Dispelled</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association and the Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cake Industry Association yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai Price Stabilization Committee stating that since the launch of price stabilization in late January of this year, the poor have benefited, often in no small measure. Looking at the various price stabilization points, every point every day, shoulders jostle, and those standing to buy number no less than thousands. The urgency of the demand is evident, and it is clear that price stabilization should continue. However, the losses from price stabilization will inevitably increase day by day, and the funds raised, to date, amount to only 700,000 yuan, which will soon be exhausted. Therefore, there is a proposal to temporarily end the program after April 7. Our associations believe that rice prices and various commodity prices have not yet fallen, and the spring harvest is still far away. The panic about the lives of the poor has not been dispelled,</p>
<p>Still Awaiting Relief</p>
<p>Those who are awaiting relief are still extremely anxious. If price stabilization is suddenly stopped at this time, we believe that it is not advisable. We are again submitting a letter to your committee, urging you to convene all Shanghai public organizations again, regardless of whether they have already made donations or not, to conduct a second expanded fundraising campaign to raise a large sum of money to continue the program. Our colleagues in the industry are still willing to attach ourselves to the rear and do our best to contribute.</p>
<p>Gunny Sack Prices Fall</p>
<p>This city is a major port for frequent import and export of various industries, so the demand for gunny sacks for packaging goods is very large. However, since the outbreak of the European War last year, because the major source of gunny sacks is Calcutta, India, transportation costs have risen sharply, so gunny sack prices have also risen. Gunny sacks that used to sell for only about ten cents each before the war have risen five or six times after the war, costing about two yuan each. However, since the rice merchants in this city ordered more than a million bags of foreign rice to be shipped to Shanghai this spring, because this foreign rice is all packaged in gunny sacks, this city has suddenly increased a large number of gunny sacks, and gunny sack prices have also fallen, selling for only one yuan and two or three cents each.</p>
<p>Production and Sales Cooperation</p>
<p>The various rice industry groups in this city, in order to discuss the organization of a rice production and sales cooperation, will convene a joint meeting of the various rice industry groups at the Bean and Rice Industry Association on Edward Road at 2:00 PM today. It is said that the participants will be the Bean and Rice Industry, the Rice Industry, the Rice Store Industry, the Rice Milling Industry, and the Distribution Industry. Also, the Fuzhou Rice Industry Teahouse Market, the price of rice per stone in Fuzhou is as high as 97 yuan. The local association sent people to the Rice Industry Teahouse Market to negotiate the purchase of foreign rice, and the city market issued a temporary entry permit for one month to assist in the relief effort.</p>
<h3>The Japanese and Puppet Regimes Actually Threaten the Post Office to Add a "Celebrating the Return of the Capital" Stamp</h3>
<p>After the Japanese side forced the two Japanese deputy directors of the Shanghai Postal Administration with violent threats, they are now using the establishment of the "new regime" in Nanjing as a reason, and the puppet "Postal Bureau" made two harsh demands to the administration: (1) Raise the "new national flag," and (2) add a "Celebrating the Return of the Capital" stamp on envelopes, both to be implemented for seven days from this morning to the 7th. Although the Director, Mr. Zha Peilin, resolutely opposed it, he was still forced to acknowledge it and implement it as scheduled. However, Mr. Zha felt that it was inappropriate to acknowledge such unreasonable demands directly and has telegraphed the Kunming General Bureau for instructions on how to deal with the situation.</p>
<h3>Low-Priced Coal Dust to Be Sold Today, Specifically for Small Coal Briquette Factories to Produce Coal Briquettes for Civilians</h3>
<p>Yitai Hing and other coal companies have allocated 1,000 tons of low-priced coal dust, and small briquette factories can purchase it from various coal yards from April 1 to April 10 in accordance with the prescribed quantities, at a price of 100 yuan per ton, paid in legal tender in one lump sum, and transported by themselves, without issuing warehouse receipts. If the deadline of April 10 is exceeded, it will be regarded as abandonment. The coal dust purchased must not be resold and must be used to make coal briquettes for sale in the market.</p>
<p>Twenty-Two Briquette Factories Purchase Low-Priced Coal</p>
<p>It is understood that a total of twenty-two small coal briquette factories are purchasing low-priced coal dust, including Huacheng Cuiji, Gongye, Yuanhua, Far East, Gongyong, Nanhua, Yuanfeng, Beiyang, Heji, Nanfang, Liyu, Xin Ping'an, Yixin, Gongping, Yongtai, Huacheng Xing, Shenhua, Yanyan, Sansen, Xinhua Gong, and Hefeng Hengkang. According to a committee member of the coal industry, the daily use and sales of coal in Shanghai has reached a balance. Moreover, Shanghai has abundant coal reserves and a large amount of cheap coal is still stockpiled, so market sentiment has softened.</p>
<p>Letter to Three Coal Companies for Third Low-Priced Sale</p>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Industry Association sent letters to the three coal companies Yitai Hing, Huazhong, and Yuantai yesterday, hoping that they would continue to benefit the people and provide low-priced Hongji coal dust to the members of the cooked water industry association for the third time. It is said that those coal companies have all expressed their approval and will do so within their capabilities. As for the second low-priced cooked water shop coal dust, it was closed at 12:00 noon yesterday. A total of about 500 tons of low-priced coal were sold in a week.</p>
<h3>Authorities in Both Concessions Lift Alert This Morning, Merchant Corps and Garrison Troops Return to Original Defense, Ordinary Alert Still in Place, Assemblies Strictly Prohibited</h3>
<p>The police authorities in the two concessions, because the day before yesterday was the date of the establishment of the "new regime" in Nanjing, feared that reactionary elements would infiltrate the concessions and disrupt order, so they implemented a special emergency alert, mobilizing the International Merchant Corps and the garrison troops of various countries in Shanghai, and closing unnecessary roads and bridges. Because the handling was proper, the authorities lifted all the barbed wire that blocked roads and bridges at 6:00 AM yesterday, and the Merchant Corps and the troops of various countries all returned to their original defense. All trolleybuses on routes 16 and 18, which had shortened their routes the day before yesterday, also operated according to their original routes. Although the special alert has been lifted, an ordinary alert is still in place, and unauthorized gatherings, parades, demonstrations, and other activities are prohibited. The Japanese and puppet troops in the Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, Hongkou, and Huxi districts are also stricter than usual, and abuse the search, fearing that patriotic elements will infiltrate and engage in activities.</p>
<h3>French Concession Increases Taxation on Restaurants, Chinese Restaurants Taxed by Number of Tables, Others Divided into Four Classes, Taxed According to Level</h3>
<p>The French Concession Board of Directors decided after a meeting to increase the business tax on Chinese restaurants, catered meals, taverns, cafes, and Western restaurants. The following are the details recorded by a reporter from Da Guang News Agency:</p>
<p>Tax Amount for Chinese Restaurants and Catered Meals</p>
<p>The new tax rates set by the bureau are as follows: (A) Chinese Restaurant Tax, (1) Chinese restaurants that do not sell alcohol (number of tables that can be accommodated in each restaurant): 2.5 yuan per month for one to five tables, 3 yuan per month for six to ten tables, 4.8 yuan per month for eleven to fifteen tables, 6.6 yuan per month for sixteen to twenty tables, 8.4 yuan per month for twenty-one to twenty-five tables, 10.2 yuan per month for twenty-six to thirty tables, 12 yuan per month for thirty-one to thirty-five tables, 16.8 yuan per month for thirty-six to fifty tables, 24 yuan per month for fifty-one to seventy tables, 36 yuan per month for seventy-one to one hundred tables, and for more than one hundred tables, 9.6 yuan per month is added for every twenty-five tables (or less than twenty-five tables), 0.5 yuan per month for each room. (2) Chinese restaurants that also sell alcohol should increase the assessed tax by 40%. (3) First-class Chinese restaurants should increase the assessed tax by 80% (with the right to sell alcohol), 1.5 yuan per month for each hall room. (B) Catered meal taxes range from 2.5 yuan to 9.6 yuan per month, divided into four classes according to their scale as follows: first class 9.6 yuan per month, second class 6 yuan per month, third class 4 yuan per month, fourth class 2.5 yuan per month.</p>
<p>Tax on Taverns, Cafes, and Western Tea Houses</p>
<p>(C) Tax on Western-style taverns and cafes: The assessment fee for taverns and cafes ranges from 20 yuan to 120 yuan per month, divided into four classes according to their scale, as follows: first class 120 yuan per month, second class 80 yuan per month, third class 40 yuan per month, fourth class 20 yuan per month. In addition, the tavern and cafe may be ordered to prepay two months of tax as a deposit. The transfer tax should be equal to one month's assessment fee. (D) Western restaurant tax: The assessment fee for Western restaurants ranges from 6 yuan to 58 yuan per month, divided into four classes according to their scale, as follows: first class 58 yuan per month, second class 24 yuan per month, third class 12 yuan per month, fourth class 6 yuan per month. In addition, the restaurant may be ordered to prepay two months of tax as protection, and the transfer tax should be equal to one month's assessment fee.</p>
<h3>National Yarn Registration Starts Today, Sales Invoices Required</h3>
<p>Regarding the cotton textile raw material certificate, it was previously stipulated that it should be handled with each yarn factory's invoice or receipt. Its existing inventory should also be reported to the Chamber of Commerce for registration by the Association with the original tax payment certificate. Now it is heard that from April 1, the method of registering with this yarn factory invoice or receipt and the original tax payment certificate has been terminated. In the future, to apply for registration or certificate, a sales invoice issued by each yarn factory must be attached. Those without a sales invoice will not be accepted under any circumstances.</p>

<h3>Japanese Establish "Industrial and Commercial Development Company" to Encompass Yangtze River Trade, Operate Riverside Industries, Remittances, Promises of Opening Forgotten, Use Pearl River as Bait for Third Countries</h3>
<p>According to the French-language Shanghai Japanese Daily, according to Japanese sources, the Eastern area has recently established a Yangtze River Industrial and Commercial Development Company, whose business objectives include various industries in the Yangtze River, remittances, and even finance, all within its scope. It is now known that the company has obtained a special permit from the "Asia Development Board" and will send Economic Minister Suzuki to Shanghai to prepare for the establishment of a branch and set up the Sino-Japanese Joint Committee to discuss all proceedings. According to previous Japanese reports regarding the opening of the Yangtze River, it was said that it could become a reality when a new "regime" was established. However, according to the recent remarks of Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sugihara, that statement is not reliable. Now, with the establishment of the "Yangtze River Industrial and Commercial Development Company," the Japanese side clearly has the determination to monopolize the Yangtze River trade. The so-called opening is likely to never be realized.</p>
<p>Japanese Again Promise to Open the Pearl River</p>
<p>Also, according to news from [unclear], the Pearl River, which is currently blockaded by the Japanese army, will be completely opened by the Japanese side this month. After opening, there will be daily steamboat service between Guangzhou and Hong Kong. Currently, a certain Westerner in Hong Kong has a privately owned ship, the Foshan, which will sail to Guangzhou on Thursday and return from Guangzhou the next day. When the ship is sailing, the carriage of goods is quite restricted. Only foodstuffs needed by foreigners living in Shamian are allowed, and all other goods are prohibited from being transported. There is a Japanese merchant ship that travels between Hong Kong and Guangzhou twice a week, carrying passengers and goods, without any restrictions.</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Japanese Goods Stockpiled in Guangzhou</p>
<p>It is said that after the Pearl River is fully opened, British merchant ships will sail between them. Foreign merchants in Hong Kong are indifferent to the news that the Pearl River will be reopened. The so-called permitting foreign merchants to sail ships is not the same as permitting foreign merchants to freely engage in business. In the past eight months, the Japanese have stockpiled a large amount of Japanese goods in Guangzhou, enough to completely exclude American and British goods. These goods are directly transported from Japan by Japanese merchant ships and warships and are completely exempt from customs duties. In addition, there is talk of reopening the Guangzhou port. The transmission of this news is caused by the recent appointment of seven Japanese by the Guangzhou Customs as internal staff members of the customs, but it is impossible to verify whether it is reliable or not.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Pickpocket Sketches</h3>
<p>— Bai Min</p>
<p>Incredibly Skillful Methods</p>
<p>The pickpocket gangs of Shanghai, with their well-organized structure, steal tens of thousands of yuan annually from the public. The police authorities of the International Settlement are striving to eradicate this crime. As for the public who directly suffer losses, they are also very concerned and devising ways to prevent it. Pickpocket gangs, like other thieves in this city, have numerous members and employ highly skillful methods, rarely failing.</p>
<p>Resembling Students and Merchants</p>
<p>They often operate in groups of three or four. Pickpockets in the English and American vernacular have a professional nickname called "Cannons." Shanghai pickpockets also have nicknames such as "One Hand." Sometimes a pickpocket looks like a student, sometimes like a prosperous merchant, and sometimes like a common midday errand boy seen on the street. They often push and shove through crowds, especially at bus stops, like the Henan Road station, where many people rush onto the bus, appearing like passengers eager to get on board. However, many pickpockets deliberately push and shove to allow their accomplices to take advantage.</p>
<p>Highly Skilled with Numerous Methods</p>
<p>There are many ways citizens fall victim to pickpockets. Sometimes, someone steps on their toes, or their hat "accidentally" gets knocked off, forcing them to bend over to pick it up, allowing the pickpocket to seize the opportunity to steal money or fountain pens. Pickpockets also often deliberately bump into someone and immediately apologize profusely. In that instant, the pickpocket standing behind the person who bumped into them can easily commit theft. Buses and trams are frequented by pickpockets. Although Xichuan Road north of Nanjing Road is only a short stretch, the police officers specializing in catching pickpockets pay particular attention to this area.</p>
<p>Important Documents Returned Intact</p>
<p>Shanghai pickpockets share one thing in common with their "colleagues" around the world: they always return valuable documents and letters found in wallets. Their usual method is to place these documents in an envelope without an address and drop it into a mailbox, allowing the postal authorities to deliver it to the police.</p>
<p>Using Razor Blades to Cut Clothing</p>
<p>Some pickpockets use razor blades embedded in pieces of wood, held between two fingers of their left hand. In crowded buses or trams, they cut open passengers' robes or even belts to steal money, acting very quickly. Victims often only realize they have been robbed when they return home. Using newspapers to block the victim's view is also an old and often successful method of theft. Pickpockets can use a newspaper to cover their hand and steal a fountain pen from the outside pocket of a suit in just one second. Sometimes, the pickpocket's actions are a bit slow, and they don't have time to hide the stolen pen, so they drop it on the ground and kick it onto the sidewalk, where another pickpocket is waiting to pick it up. If the person who lost the pen notices the theft, the pickpocket who picked up the pen returns it to the owner, often receiving thanks in return.</p>
<p>Pretending to be Blind with a Coat Over Arm</p>
<p>Readers should also be wary of people with a coat draped over their left arm, as they can use the coat to conceal their right hand in a crowd and reach into your pocket to steal items. Watches attached to delicate watch chains can easily be stolen by experienced pickpockets using special methods to break the chain. Cameras are also easy to steal. If you see a blind person walking along the road, you should try to help them cross dangerous intersections. However, remember that not all "blind" people are completely blind, so some "blind" people bump into people simply to steal items from their pockets. American sailors often encounter pickpockets posing as "news vendors," who extend newspapers in front of the sailors and take advantage of that moment to steal items from the left chest pocket of their uniforms.</p>
<p>Female Pickpockets are Even More Skilled</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there are few women in pickpocket gangs, but in England and America, there are many, and they are even more skilled than men. However, although pickpockets steal tens of thousands of yuan worth of goods each year, they themselves receive very little. This is because there are also instances of extortion within their ranks. For example, if a pickpocket gang steals a large amount of goods, they must share some of it with rival gangs to avoid being exposed.</p>
<p>If You Suspect Theft, Don't Make a Scene</p>
<p>To avoid having your belongings stolen by these criminals, you must be vigilant at all times. If you are on public transportation and suspect a theft, do not make a scene. Simply go to the conductor and tell them, and they will close the doors until the police arrive.</p>
<p>Be Careful of Pickpockets, Pay Attention to Six Points</p>
<p>There are also a few points to note: (1) Never hang cameras or bags on your shoulder, as a razor blade can quickly cut the strap. (2) Be careful of people who extend newspapers in front of you. (3) Never put anything in the back right pocket of your trousers, as this is the easiest place to be robbed. (4) If you don't want to lose your fountain pens and pencils, it's best to keep them in an inside pocket. (5) Pay attention to people who bump into you and apologize profusely. (6) Finally, if you suspect a theft, remember to report it to the police.</p>
<h3>Although Hongkou is Open, It is Not a Safe Area: Explanation from the Ministry of Economic Affairs</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce handles the list of certificates for national goods in this city, and its scope is limited to the safe areas within the two concessions. Previously, due to the reopening of the Hongkou Municipal Council Police, factories in that area requested to be treated equally and issued certificates. After the Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram requesting instructions, it received a reply telegram from the Ministry of Economic Affairs stating that the area could not be considered a safe area.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Officers from the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment Transferred to the U.S.: A Total of Twenty-Seven Officers Have Received Orders; U.S. Officers Simultaneously Ordered to China</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that twenty-seven officers from the Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai have received orders to return to the United States for duty. Therefore, there will be a major rotation of officers in the regiment. Among the officers who have received orders is Lieutenant Colonel Moore, the current Executive Officer of the Fourth Regiment, who will be transferred to the Pacific Department in San Francisco, California. Lieutenant Colonel Stark, the Training Officer of the regiment, will be transferred to the Marine Corps School in Quantico, Florida, as a staff officer. Both men have now been promoted to the rank of Colonel. The remaining twenty-five officers range from Major to Captain. At the same time, a total of fifty-one Marine Corps officers currently in the United States have received orders to leave the U.S. for service in Asia. It is expected that they will replace the twenty-seven officers leaving Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chinese Merchant Corps Holds Shooting Competition: Xie Yihan and Others Take the Lead</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Merchant Corps has a tradition of the "Shixia Cup," a memento from Mr. Yu Qiaqing and Mr. Yuan Hengzhi, the president and vice president of the Chinese Corps Association, to commend Mr. Chen Shixia, the captain of the corps. The captain humbly declined and instead donated it to the members of the Chinese Corps as a competition prize. It was stipulated that all members of the two corps who had perfect attendance in all classes throughout the previous year could participate as an encouragement. It is reported that there were forty-seven members with perfect attendance last year. The final was held at the Municipal Council practice ground at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. The competition consisted of small target shooting, including bullseye target, crescent target, slow fire with sandbag rest, and unrestrained, for a total of twenty shots, with a total score of eighty points. Under the command of Chief Instructor Li Yushu and shooting instructor Zhong Yuting, the competition was held in batches. Captain Chen also personally inspected the site. The atmosphere was extremely tense. After the shooting ended, the scores were calculated, and Sergeant Xie Yihan scored the highest, with seventy-three points out of eighty, winning the cup and taking the championship. Staff Sergeant Ye Renqian scored sixty-seven points, taking second place, and Sergeant Su Shangjiong scored sixty-five points, taking third place. It is reported that the prizes will be presented by Captain Chen's wife at the corps drill next Wednesday.</p>
<h3>After Adjustments, Sino-American Trade Increased by 200 Million Yuan Last Year Compared to the Previous Year</h3>
<p>After adjustments to Sino-American trade, barter agreements were established, leading to a sharp increase in the export of bristles, tung oil, silk, tea, and minerals to the United States. Conversely, the United States significantly increased its exports of machinery, tools, and metal products to China. In 1939, American goods exported to China were valued at 114.1 million yuan in national currency, while Chinese goods exported to the United States were valued at 225.872 million yuan in national currency. Compared to the previous year, imports increased by 62.846 million yuan, and exports increased by 137.671 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Unified Class C Bonds Scheduled for Lottery Drawing: Discounted Payment to Be Made at the End of July After Drawing of Five Bond Types</h3>
<p>The National Government previously issued the Unified National Bonds of 1936, totaling 146 million yuan, by the Ministry of Finance, with the surplus of customs duties as the repayment fund, in order to unify bond names and redeem old bonds. After the customs duties fell into enemy hands after the fall of the city, payments were temporarily suspended. In order to maintain creditworthiness, the National Debt Fund Management Committee, in addition to the normal lottery repayment, requested the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank to discount and pay for matured coupons and winning bonds. Now, for the ninth lottery repayment, in addition to the Class A and Class B bonds that have already been drawn, the Class C bonds are scheduled to be drawn at 10:00 a.m. on April. The association has sent letters to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers Association, and the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications, requesting them to send representatives to the venue to supervise. After the Class A, B, C, D, and E bonds have been drawn, the four banks will discount and pay from July 31. In addition, the payments for the first lottery for the repayment of principal and interest for the Finance Minister Si Public Bonds will begin on April 1, since March 31 is a Sunday holiday.</p>
<h3>After Police Warning, Counterfeit British Pound Banknotes Disappear: These Counterfeit Notes Seem to Have Been Used by a Certain Ship; Cafés and Silk Shops Were Defrauded</h3>
<p>The Continental Times reports that counterfeit Bank of England ten-pound notes were circulating in the city last week. After a certain foreign ship left Shanghai, these counterfeit notes quickly stopped circulating. However, the police are unwilling to announce the name of the ship. It has been found that the businesses that mistakenly received these counterfeit notes include the Dahua Café, the Piedmont Café, and a certain Chinese-owned silk shop.</p>
<p>After the Police Issued a Warning to the Public a few days ago, these counterfeit notes have not been found again. Therefore, the police believe that the counterfeiters have been deterred by the warning. It is believed that a certain foreign ship, likely a French ship, was used by the crew to distribute the counterfeit notes before it was discovered. The police have inquired at various ports of call that the ship passed through on its way to Shanghai, and have issued warnings to the ports that it will pass through on its way back home. It is said that the British</p>
<p>Police Headquarters</p>
<p>have been notified and may investigate the source of the counterfeit notes in Europe. According to the investigation by the detectives of the Public Concession Police, it was initially thought that these counterfeit notes were manufactured in this city and were almost indistinguishable from the real notes, with watermarks, but the paper was inferior to the real notes. 25 of these counterfeit banknotes were found in this city, and over 1,500 yuan was defrauded in cash and goods.</p>

<h3>Shanghai West Gambling Dens Show No Sign of Being Eliminated: Rumor of a New "Supervisory Office" Being Established</h3>
<p>The Pingming News Agency reports that all gambling dens in the extra-settlement road area of western Shanghai were previously rumored to have been shut down, but to this day, so-called clubs and dance halls decorated with neon lights still exist, though not as lively as before. According to insiders, the Japanese "Entertainment Supervisory Office," which receives a daily tribute of 400-500 yuan per establishment, has not been around for two months, and it is still uncertain how long its fate will last. In addition, the recent rise in highway robberies has made gamblers wary and reluctant to go. As a result, some gambling dens will automatically shut down.</p>
<p>Gambling Industry Declines</p>
<p>The News Agency reports that gambling dens in western Shanghai were rumored to have closed on the 29th of last month, but this has now been confirmed to be untrue. In recent days, the gambling dens have remained the same as before, but large gambling dens such as Qiuyuan and Bingfeng have few gamblers and business has plummeted. It is reported that certain parties have decided to extend the life of these gambling dens, so the shutdown rumor will certainly not come to pass as scheduled.</p>
<p>Another Den of Iniquity</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, the licenses for each gambling den were revoked on March 10, and have not been reissued to this day. Therefore, they have been transformed and are now called "Yellow Cattle Sheds." Note that "Yellow Cattle Shed" is another name for unlicensed gambling dens. Furthermore, the Victoria gambling den at the intersection of Yuyuan Road and Difeng Road is now reorganizing, renaming itself the Chinese General Association, and has been rushing to repair the buildings in recent days. Thus, not only is there no sign of eliminating gambling dens in western Shanghai, but another den of iniquity will emerge to suck people dry.</p>
<p>Gambling Tax Doubles</p>
<p>Huguang News Agency reports that the rumor of gambling dens in western Shanghai closing down is unlikely to materialize, as a new "Entertainment Venue Supervision and Police Office" is rumored to be established tomorrow (i.e., today). It is said that the new director will be a man named Hu Sibao, and all gambling dens, large and small, will have to pay donations to the office. The increase in "entertainment" donations is said to be several times greater than in the past. Therefore, some small-scale gambling dens may not be able to sustain themselves and will close on their own.</p>
<h3>The Funeral of Mr. Huang Jiahuai Held with Great Honor</h3>
<p>After Mr. Huang Jiahuai, the founder and executive director of the former China National Anti-Drug Association, passed away from illness, his funeral was held at the International Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road at 2:00 p.m. on March 30. No less than several thousand wreaths and elegiac couplets were sent from all walks of life, and the road was packed with people. Among those who came to pay their respects were Mr. Ho Te-kuei, the Deputy Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, Dr. Li Denghui, the former president of Fudan University, Mr. Bu Fangji, the president of St. John's University, the daughter of Mr. Wang Jingqi, the envoy to Poland, Mrs. Huang Chaoqin, the wife of the Consul General in India, lawyer Cai Runian, Zhang Xiqi, the president of Guanghua Eye Hospital, Zhang Zhixue, a worker at the YWCA, Mrs. Guo Bingwen, Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, Yin Zhiling, Dr. Zhang Tianze, an editor at the Commercial Press, and pediatric expert Su Zixiang, among hundreds of others, who all personally assisted in the funeral. The memorial service was presided over by Pastor Wei Xiben of Zhusheng Church. Mr. Ho Te-kuei and Dr. Wang Yawei gave speeches on Mr. Huang's spirit of serving society, which moved the audience to tears. At 4:00 p.m., the burial was moved to the Hongqiao Road Cemetery.</p>
<h3>Dispute over Leasing Ships: Plaintiff Appeals</h3>
<p>Ye Chuanfang, the manager of Huashang Company located at No. 2 The Bund, French Concession, previously had a dispute with Mr. Madden (transliteration), the manager of the British company Hongde Foreign Firm, over the purchase of the Nandao vessel. Mr. Madden appointed lawyer Xu Shihao to file a lawsuit against Ye Chuanfang in the Civil Court of the Special Court, demanding the delivery of the Nandao vessel. The plaintiff was to pay the defendant a price of 20,000 pounds, and the defendant was to pay the plaintiff a monthly compensation of 1,360 pounds from October 31 of the previous year until the actual delivery date. If the defendant could not deliver the ship, in addition to the above-mentioned compensation, the defendant was to pay the plaintiff an additional 10,000 pounds. The defendant, Ye Chuanfang, appointed lawyer Jiang Yiping to defend, denying that there was a contract to sell the ship. After several hearings by judge Yu Changzi, the result was a judgment on December 26 of the previous year dismissing the plaintiff's claim, with the plaintiff bearing the litigation costs. The plaintiff expressed dissatisfaction with the initial judgment and filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court within the statutory period. The Third Branch of the Higher Court opened an investigation court the day before yesterday afternoon, summoning both parties for questioning. After the lawyers for both parties agreed to request a postponement of the hearing, the judge granted the request and scheduled another hearing.</p>
<h3>Murderer of Watchman Arrested: Wife Also Detained</h3>
<p>Cai Wenlong (age 22), a native of Haimen, lives at No. 52, Lane 305, North Fujian Road. At approximately 7:00 p.m. on February 14, he and his brother and several friends were gambling in a room at the Shanghai New Hotel on Jiujiang Road. At some point, his brother went outside and got into a dispute with a rickshaw puller over the fare, violently assaulting the puller and causing him to bleed from the face. At this time, Huang Buqi, a watchman (No. 1782) from Nantong, intervened and had a disagreement with Cai Wenlong and his brother. Harboring resentment, Cai Wenlong invited two hooligans with handguns to the hotel at approximately 9:00 p.m. on February 18. Seeking trouble with the watchman, he pulled out a handgun and fired two shots at Huang, one bullet hitting his right arm. He then took the opportunity to escape. Huang the watchman went to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the injury was minor. After being bandaged by the doctor, he was discharged from the hospital and reported the incident to the Old Gate Police Station, but no arrests were made. Finally, at approximately 10:00 p.m. on March 29, Wang Youguan, the Chinese detective chief of the Hui Police Station, received a tip about Cai Wenlong's whereabouts. He rushed to the address and arrested him. After investigation, it was found that the handgun used to shoot Huang came from his wife, Ms. Gu. She denied it, but she was also arrested and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday, they were both sent to the Special Court. Police clerk Qian Xunjiu prosecuted for attempted murder, requesting detention. Judge Huang Risheng questioned both defendants, but their testimony was evasive. He ordered them to be detained again and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3>New Pharmaceutical Companies to Sell Rice at Low Prices: Starting Today; Held Simultaneously in Both Concessions; Limit of Two Jin Per Person</h3>

<h3>Fire in the Fahuazhen Area: Two Young Children Burned to Death</h3>
<p>The area next to the Huaibentang Hall in the Houjia Lane of Fahuazhen in western Shanghai was originally a vegetable garden. After the withdrawal of the National Army to the west, small industrial factories generally rented land in that area, temporarily building over a hundred wooden houses to set up weaving factories, foundries, dyeing factories, enamel factories, tobacco factories, and other factories. The workers lived there. Suddenly, a fire broke out in the middle of the night the night before last, immediately erupting through the roof. The fire was fierce and out of control. Later, firefighters from the British and French concessions rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire. However, there were no water facilities in the area, and the houses were mostly made of wood, which burned quickly. The fire was not extinguished until approximately 3:00 a.m., and two young children were burned to death.</p>
<h3>Incidents of Robbery</h3>
<p>Eight robbers suddenly arrived at the China Match Factory at No. 11 West Baileynan Road at approximately 1:00 a.m. yesterday morning. Three of the robbers were carrying Mauser pistols and broke into the dormitory of factory employees, including He Boren. The robbers searched and looted approximately 2,000 yuan in valuables. Fake police went to intercept them, and both sides exchanged dozens of shots. As a result, none of the robbers were arrested, nor were any injured.</p>
<p>Shi Jintang, a woodworker, 36 years old, lives at No. 56 Yaojiajiao, Kaixuan Road. At approximately 9:00 a.m. yesterday morning, he went to the Fengdadian Pawnshop in Hui Jiadu to pawn clothes for 36.4 yuan. While walking near No. 1174, Baileynan Road, he was suddenly stopped by robbers. Shi resisted, angering the robbers, who fired a shot, hitting Shi in the left leg, causing him to fall to the ground. All the legal tender was robbed by the robbers. He was later discovered and sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>At 8:35 a.m. yesterday morning, three robbers broke into No. 175 Mabailu, International Settlement, intending to rob. The business discovered them and called the police. The robbers, not daring to stay, rushed out the door and escaped, without any losses.</p>
<p>At 9:45 a.m. yesterday morning, two robbers broke into a watch repair shop at No. 89 Shandong Road. One held a handgun and forbade anyone from making a sound. As a result, they robbed fourteen watches, valued at 250 yuan, and escaped.</p>
<h3>The Principles of Artificially Digested Proteins</h3>
<p>The elements of human nutrition are no more than five types: fats, proteins, carbohydrates, minerals, and vitamins. Among them, proteins, carbohydrates, and fats are the materials for combustion, the foundation of heat, and the source of energy. In particular, proteins have other important missions. The tissues of the human body, such as muscles, blood, and organs, are mostly composed of proteins. Therefore, their growth and development require a sufficient supply of proteins. Even after growth and development, tens of grams of protein are consumed daily. The supplement for this consumption must come from external absorption in order to sustain life. However, the structure of proteins is very complex, and proteins themselves do not directly produce nutritional effects. If the human body wants to use proteins for nutrition, it must go through the enzymes of the stomach, pancreas, and small intestine, and undergo several digestive processes, breaking down complex substances into simple substances. These circulate with the blood and are then absorbed by the tissues for combustion, blood production, and muscle building. The supply of these simple substances is called the final product of protein digestion. In academic terms, it is called "amino acids." Foods such as milk and eggs, which contain the most protein, may not have a nutritional effect even if several kilograms are consumed daily. This is because milk and eggs must be digested by the intestines and stomach before they can be transformed into proteins needed by the human body. People with weak stomachs and intestines cannot digest and absorb them and transform them into proteins needed by the human body. Artificial proteins are made by using proteins from milk and eggs, etc., and following the methods of our digestive system, undergoing various chemical operations, and completely transforming them into artificially digested proteins "amino acids." After taking them, they do not need to be digested by the intestines and stomach and can be assimilated and absorbed by human tissues, directly producing blood, building muscles, nourishing the limbs and all parts of the body. Even taking a small amount can stimulate cells to promote metabolism and revitalize the whole body, increase the secretion of digestive juices to aid food digestion, and enable the body tissues to absorb, promote development, and increase resistance to disease, mental power, growth, activity, reproductive functions, etc. Therefore, this product is especially important for people with declining energy and suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. Since the tuberculous substance causes fever throughout the body, the protein in the body must be decomposed and destroyed. Supplementation with this product is an important medicine for lung disease. "Guiling Pian" uses this artificial protein as its main ingredient.</p>
<h3>Special Features of Guiling Tablets</h3>
<p>Guiling tablets are made from endocrine glands and artificially digested protein, containing effective ingredients such as active enzymes. They contain multiple views of youthful animals and 'hormone' stimulants. They have the effect of enhancing reproductive function, vigorous development, and directly supplementing the body's essential protein components. Therefore, those who are old and physically weak can restore youthful reproductive function and become stronger by taking it. Young people with kidney deficiency and physical weakness can replenish essence and marrow by taking it, returning to the vigorous days of their youth. The effects are significant and incredibly responsive, surpassing general tonics by hundreds or thousands of times. It is truly a beneficial and harmless sacred medicine. Taking one box enhances appetite and banishes illness. Taking it for one month strengthens the body and replenishes essence, making one tireless in work. Taking it continuously for several months can restore the physical strength and spirit of youth, even for those who are weak and incapable. It is truly a sacred product among medicines.</p>
<h3>Main Indications for Guiling Tablets</h3>
<p>Neurasthenia, decreased reproductive ability, decreased libido, incomplete development, impotence and premature ejaculation, night sweats and seminal emission, masturbation injuries, decreased erectile strength, lack of pleasure, difficulty in having children, old age weakness, premature aging in youth, gray hair and loose teeth, deafness and blurred vision, exhaustion, soreness and weakness in the lower back and legs, decreased vision, poor memory while studying, consumption and spitting blood, pulmonary tuberculosis and cough, fever and emaciation, as well as digestive diseases, decreased appetite, malnutrition, heart weakness, anemia and insomnia, diabetes, beriberi, recovery after illness, insufficient child development, and weakness before and after childbirth in women, menstrual disorders, and infertility.

<h3>Woman Abuses Adopted Daughter</h3>
<p>Zhu Zhang, a woman from Pudong residing at No. 9 Min Ti Ni Yin Road, acquired Zhu Chunmei, a girl from Zhenjiang (now sixteen years old), as an adopted daughter ten years ago. She frequently abused her, causing indignation among neighbors. They secretly informed the French police by letter. Upon receiving the information, the police dispatched Detective Ye Bichang on the 29th to investigate. After confirming the facts, Ms. Zhu was arrested and taken to the No. 2 Special Court, Criminal Division 1. After being questioned by Judge Ao, the defendant was ordered to be remanded in custody for further hearing on April 1.</p>
<h3>Dock Thugs Arrested</h3>
<p>Jin Gui, also known as Jin Er, a drifter from Jiangbei, 35 years old, specialized in colluding with gangs to rob coal boats anchored in the river along West Suzhou Road, dividing the spoils for personal use. His gang had about a hundred members. Around 3 a.m. on February 25, he invited more than ten members of his gang, armed with iron bars and axes, to rob cargo from a coal boat at the dock belonging to the Tokyo Road Nanyang Coal Ball Factory, but failed. He then vented his anger on a Chinese watchman named Zhang Zhilin, injuring his head with an ax. They fled in a frenzy. Around 4 p.m. on the 29th of this month, Chinese Detective Inspector Feng Baishun and Detectives Ma Guiliang and Han Yongchang from the Putuo Road Police Station arrested Jin Gui Zhang and his accomplice Yan Si at the Maigen Bathhouse on Maigen Road. They were taken into custody and escorted to the Special No. 1 Court yesterday. The police lawyer requested detention. The court ordered them remanded in custody for further review.</p>

<p>Around 7 a.m. yesterday, a square glass bottle was suddenly placed at the entrance of the printing machine room of the Da Wan Bao at No. 160 Edward Road. At the time, an apprentice in the machine room mistakenly stepped on it. Unexpectedly, flames erupted from the bottle, immediately causing a fire, and the apprentice's foot was burned. After the incident, it was reported to the police, who sent him to the hospital for treatment. It is said that the glass bottle contained a chemical fuel that can spontaneously combust upon contact with air, making it a type of chemical incendiary device.</p>

<h3>Old News Re-Copied Sixty-Seven Years Ago (441)</h3>
<p>(See the original report from the 12th year of Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty)</p>
<p>Collection of Strange News</p>
<p>(1) In Suzhou, on the evening of the 21st of the previous month, as the sun was setting and the sparse stars were dimly visible, looking up at the sky, a streak of black air suddenly appeared, spanning from south to north, resembling clouds but not clouds, resembling smoke but not smoke, like a long rainbow after rain, stretching across the sky. After about the time it takes to cook millet, it then moved southward with the wind, its momentum like an arrow shot and disappeared. (2) A certain tofu shop on Peach Blossom Dock West Street in Suzhou needs water every day, mostly drawn the night before and filled in the shop. There used to be three water vats, each large enough to hold ten piculs. In early May, the shop woke up in the morning to grind and fetch water, but suddenly saw the bottom of the vats dry. Initially suspecting the shop assistants were lazy, the owner did not think much of it. However, this happened for more than ten days, with not a drop left. Therefore, the shop owner invited several of his colleagues and neighbors to hold candles and wait to see the strangeness. Around the third watch, a thing indeed wriggled at the mouth of the vat, initially as thin as an earthworm, then as thick as a rafter or pillar, and in an instant, it was thicker than several embraces, with mottled scales, golden red color, and the shape of a giant python, without head or tail. The crowd was startled and noisy upon seeing it. The monster coiled and did not move. Before long, the water in the vat dried up, and the monster also disappeared. Its origin was unknown, and its destination was also unknown. When the vat was lifted, there was no hole or cavity. The shop owner, fearing disturbance, moved his family away that very day, it is said. (3) A small town three miles away from Zhoupu Town, named One Grain Pearl. Because there is a large tomb in the heart of the town, about several tens of feet high, visible from ten miles away, as round as a pearl, hence the town got its name. Yesterday, dark clouds suddenly gathered densely, and in the dimness, four black dragons and two white dragons were seen, heading from south to north. The wind was very strong, blowing down fifty houses. For a moment, chickens crowed, dogs barked, magpies were in chaos, and crows flew away. The residents fled for their lives. About thirty or forty people were crushed and injured. Afterwards, the dark clouds scattered, and heavy rain poured down, with red light flashing incessantly, stopping only at five o'clock.</p>

<h3>Spring Break and Travel Shadows</h3>
<p>By Shadow-Observer</p>
<p>Spring is the season for travel, especially during spring break. People in the city have a strong interest in traveling. For the sake of spring, even if they don't visit famous mountains and rivers, just going to the suburbs, they can see the bright spring scenery, with peach blossoms, green willows, and yellow rape flowers, enough to make people intoxicated. Moreover, the spring break is relatively long, allowing you to take time out to travel far away. For this reason, spring break seems to be specifically for people to enjoy the spring. Who would want to fail to appreciate the spring if it is possible?</p>
<p>Indeed, in my opinion, travel is the greatest pleasure in life. No entertainment can give people as much pleasure as travel. Watching movies and listening to Peking opera are too vulgar. Only travel, to a scenic spot, the fresh air and beautiful scenery, will give people a new stimulus, and they will involuntarily linger; and sometimes you have no car or sedan to travel, you can only walk, allowing you to climb mountains and cross ridges, getting a chance to exercise. If you are a scholar or a young student, travel can enhance a lot of knowledge about history, geography, and natural science, with many benefits!</p>
<p>People who love art will naturally find travel even more interesting. A writer, going out for a trip, can write several travelogues; a poet, traveling, seeing mountains, rivers, and people, can find poetic material everywhere, and even unconsciously recite poems to nature; a painter, going out to travel, will never forget to bring painting tools, and will sketch immediately upon seeing lovely scenery; especially people who love photography, bringing a camera, can capture beautiful scenery everywhere; bringing it home can serve as a travel souvenir.</p>
<p>Now Shanghai has become an "isolated island," so even during spring break, apart from visiting parks, you cannot go out to travel. But the facts tell us that in recent years, the people of Shanghai have developed a strong interest in travel. In previous years, especially during this spring break, there would be many men and women leaving Shanghai to travel to scenic spots such as Suzhou, Hangzhou, Ningbo, and Wuxi. The trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Beijing-Shanghai lines were exceptionally crowded, with little capacity left. And the group tours launched by several travel agencies had hundreds or even thousands of men and women, large groups of people, traveling to various places, everyone wanting to appreciate the beauty of nature. The intensity of the interest can be seen from this.</p>
<h3>"Clothing" Chemical Stain Removal Methods</h3>
<p>By New</p>
<p>A brand-new piece of clothing, in ten thousand careful attentions, accidentally encountered a moment of negligence, stained with oil or ink, blood stains, this is a completely unforeseen accident, and also a common thing that people cannot avoid. Going to the laundry? The price is too expensive, so to deal with this oil stain, you can only directly seek help from washing with chemical products.</p>
<p>If it is an oil stain, just use volatile oil (commonly known as gasoline) to rub it off slightly. If it is stained with ink, you can apply acetic acid, or dissolve tartaric acid in moderate clean water, translate it, and apply it, then apply ammonia water. Rub each other in this way five or six times, and the ink will fade. If you encounter red ink, you should use a mixture of alcohol and acetic acid to wipe it off. For ink stains, you can slowly rub it with rice grains, then apply oleic acid, and the stain will fade. For blood stains, you can also remove them with soap. If the blood is unusually thick, it needs to be soaked in soda water first, then coated with a salt solution, and finally moved into salt water, and the blood can be completely removed. However, the most important thing to note is that the heat of warm water can cause the protein in the blood to stick firmly to the fibers, so it is crucial to avoid using warm water first.</p>
<h3>Coal Ball Saving Method Club</h3>
<p>By Club</p>
<p>Coal balls are a necessary fuel for Shanghai people every day. Their price was originally very cheap. I remember in the spring of 1937, Shanghai coal balls were only one dollar per dan (a unit of weight), and they were first-class goods. However, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the cost of living on this isolated island has been increasing day by day, and the prices of all goods have soared. Coal balls are, of course, no exception, so the price has risen from one yuan per dan to two yuan, three yuan, four yuan... up to more than seven yuan. Although it is said that prices are now being sold at a flat rate, the price is still as high as five yuan and eight jiao per dan. We cannot predict whether the future trend will be up or down, but such a large price is indeed unprecedented! The people of Shanghai, living hard under this high pressure, on the one hand, of course, hope that the authorities of the concession can work hard to suppress prices, and on the other hand, they can only try to save money themselves to reduce a little bit of expenditure. Now let's talk about this method of saving coal balls.</p>
<p>I feel that keeping the coal stove burning all day long is too uneconomical, because in these hours after dinner (from about one o'clock to five o'clock), except for boiling some water, the stove is simply unnecessary. Since it is not needed, what should we do? Let's extinguish it, then we have to relight it when we cook dinner, which is too troublesome. Keeping it burning is wasteful, and extinguishing it is troublesome, so what is the best way? There is a compromise method—sealing the mouth of the coal stove, which is to take the burned coal balls poured out of the coal stove. The outside of these coal balls has turned red, but the center is still a bit black. Take this black part and add water to grind it finely, then add a little red ash, and mix it into a slurry. When you want to seal the mouth after dinner, add enough coal balls to the stove, and put a layer of this slurry on the surface, and make a hole in the center for ventilation. In this way, the coal stove will not go out, and you can still put a pot of water on it. When you want to unseal it, just open the coal stove, add some coal balls, and fan it. This is a very simple and economical method. Otherwise, you have to add at least two or three jiao of coal balls in the afternoon, which is worth at least ten cents, and that would be more than three yuan a month. If you implement it this way, wouldn't those three yuan be saved? If you don't know this method yet, why not try it!</p>

<h3>Lost a Living Encyclopedia In Memory of Chen Xuyuan, Mr. Tianxu Wosheng, a Special Writer for This Publication</h3>
<p>By Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>On the morning of March 24, a drizzly morning, as if the heavens were shedding tears, the gray sky was low, showing a desolate atmosphere. In a small building in Jingu Village on Amyot Road, lay a dying old man with a white beard. The burned-out incense burner, the haggard flowers in the vase, and the family members with knitted brows were silently accompanying him. As soon as he woke up early in the morning, he said to his beloved son and daughter, "I am leaving at ten o'clock today; let me sleep well for a while at this moment." Then he closed his eyes and slowly fell asleep. Hearing his words "to leave," the children were too sad to speak, they just stared intently at the old father. The small building was quiet, without any sound, and even a rosefinch in a carved cage was silent. After an unknown amount of time, the clock on the wall suddenly struck ten times, breaking the silent air in the small building, and directly hitting the hearts of the children. The old father on the bed just breathed a sigh of relief and was silent. The children rushed forward, shouting and crying, but it was too late. They only smelled a faint scent of agarwood from the old father's mouth, and his breath was cut off. At that instant, Mr. Chen Xuyuan, Tianxu Wosheng, a giant in the literary and business circles, quietly walked out of the world and ended his sixty-two years of hard work, struggle, and indomitable history. Not only his family suffered a great loss, but also the society and the country suffered a great loss; even the writer, who had been in deep friendship with the old man for more than twenty years, felt a great loss—the loss of a living encyclopedia!</p>
<p>Mr. Chen was a literati, but not a bookworm; he had experience, insight, talent, spirit, new ideas, creativity, and also understood worldly affairs and human feelings. He was really a multi-faceted scholar, worthy of being a mentor for our general literati. His life was somewhat like that of the Russian literary giant Gorky. He was repeatedly tested in the furnace of failure and finally created the career of his dreams. He had been a teacher, a small businessman, a company boss, a clerk in a government office, an acting magistrate, and had also run magazines and tabloids. In 1914, he had also been the editor of the Free Talk supplement of Shenbao. Because of Free Talk, he compiled a Book of Household Knowledge that sold more than one million copies, and because of the Book of Household Knowledge, he invented facial tooth powder, founded the Family Industrial Cooperative, overthrew imported tooth powder, and saved a lot of profit for the country. After that, he manufactured various other cosmetics, made wine, made medicine, made paper, made soda fruit juice, and made medicinal foam fire extinguishers, all with considerable success. He would not think about something, but once he thought about it, he had to bury himself in hard work and realize it one by one. As for literature, he could write prose, write poetry, fill in lyrics, make songs, and write novels. Although he had created a career in the business world, he still did not abandon literary work, and took literary work as a pastime every day. His knowledge was too rich, from astronomy and geography to the Three Religions and Nine Schools, he knew almost everything. He had not studied English or chemistry, but when you talked to him about chemistry, he would talk eloquently, more knowledgeable than a chemist. He was good at talking, and welcomed people to chat with him. If you had any difficult questions to ask him, he would know everything and say everything, and he was so willing to enlighten the younger generation and was not afraid of being tedious, which was truly touching. For example, whenever I was bored, I would always visit him, talk about poetry, talk about lyrics, talk about philosophy, talk about all kinds of common sense, and thus gained a lot. Although the old man treated me as an old friend, I regarded him as my teacher, my living encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Three years ago, his second son, Rong, fell into the pool and died, and I was extremely sad. Mr. Chen comforted me with a long poem, and told me to always recite the words "like yesterday's death" to relieve myself. Since then, whenever I encountered unsatisfactory things, I would often silently recite these five words, and I did get a lot of comfort. When the August 13th Incident broke out, the writer left his hometown and ran away, and thought of Mr. Chen on West Lake, and sent him a poem: "Your home is originally secluded and beautiful on West Lake, and my Tianping is also enough to boast. Who would have thought that after a period of separation and chaos, only the mountains and water are left, and there is no home." Alas! The remaining water and broken mountains, wanting to return is difficult. Mr. Chen actually left quietly like this. Under the Nine Springs, I am afraid that he will not be willing.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 26th, I took a wreath and rushed to the World Funeral Home to pay my respects. My heart was only filled with sourness, and I had no strength in my limbs. Struggling to walk into the mourning hall to see the old man's last side, my tears had long rolled down like rain, and I embraced and cried bitterly with Dieye in the bitter block, no longer able to control myself. Alas, Mr. Chen, the tears of sadness in my life, there were only three pairs before: crying for my father thirty-nine years ago, crying for my brother sixteen years ago, and crying for my son three years ago. This is the fourth pair of tears of sadness, and today I sincerely dedicate them to you, old man.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen's voice and smile can never be forgotten, and every time I recall it, I just want to be heartbroken; as for Mr. Chen's good words and deeds, they cannot be summarized in this short article. Let me borrow a newly composed elegiac couplet to make an ending:</p>
<p>The great cause is bright and dazzling, and his extraordinary abilities surpassed Gongshuzi.</p>
<p>The Central Plains is still disturbed, and his regret is as deep as that of Lu Fangweng.</p>
<h3>One Week Economic Menu</h3>
<p>— Miss Hua Ying</p>
<p>The golden flower vegetable, originally named "Ju Xu", is commonly known as "Cao Tou" (grass head), and is a relatively inexpensive type of vegetable. The ones produced in Hangzhou are not as soft and glutinous as those produced locally, because their stems are too long and too hard. The vegetarian way of preparing it is very simple, just cut dried tofu into strips and stir-fry them together; however, this vegetable absorbs a lot of oil, so you need to use more oil. As for the non-vegetarian way of preparing it, it is most suitable to combine it with fatty pork; first cut the pork into large pieces and braise it in a pot until it is tender, then stir-fry the golden flower vegetable and place it under the pork. When the pork oil seeps into the vegetable, it tastes very rich and delicious. It is also okay to braise the pork and golden flower vegetable together, but the color will be less appealing, so it is best to braise the pork separately and stir-fry the golden flower vegetable separately, so that the red and green colors complement each other, which can also increase your appetite.</p>

<h3>Where are our children's books?</h3>
<p>— Dao Hong</p>
<p>Recently, this publication has repeatedly discussed the issue of corporal punishment of children. I think this is a good phenomenon, and I want to congratulate the children. While children's physical fitness is worth our attention, the issue of children's spiritual food—children's books—is also very important. I want to say a few words on this point.</p>
<p>We cannot deny that nutritious children's books have always been scarce. Even before the war, people kept shouting the slogan of increasing children's books, but the results were not satisfactory. As for the situation after the war, as far as Shanghai today is concerned, the poverty of children's books can be said to have reached an unprecedented level - hopefully it will be the last time. Although Shanghai's cultural circles are not as prosperous as before the war, there are still quite a few old newspapers and magazines available on newsstands. But what about children's books? Have we seen any? The former "Little Friend," "Elementary School Student," "New Youth," "Children's Magazine," and "Children's Pictorial" have long been discontinued, and no new ones have emerged. I have a relative who has always paid close attention to children's education. Recently, because he couldn't buy books for his children to read, he borrowed the "Little Friend" and "Children's Pictorial" that my younger brother used to read from my house for his children to read. If someone says that there is no business in children's books, so no publishers are willing to publish them, as the reason for the poverty of children's books in Shanghai, I am afraid that it is not entirely true.</p>
<p>At present, not only are there no real children's books, but there are also no people who advocate for them. In the past, many newspapers and magazines discussed the issue of children's books very lively and seriously, but now this issue is no longer mentioned, as if it has been forgotten. I should say that children are also following the country's misfortune!</p>
<p>The importance of children's books is needless to say. A foreign educator said: Whether a country's education is developed or not can be generally seen from the number of good children's books it has. From this sentence, we can imagine the importance of children's books.</p>
<p>Because of the lack of children's books, the result is that children are crowding towards old bookstores. And the old novels and comic strips in the bookstores are not only devoid of nutrition, but also contain poison. It is really unimaginable the harm that these absurd and unfounded mythical ideas have on children's pure minds. It seems that someone once advocated burning all these books. I agree with this method; but if we don't replace them with new books, I think even if we really burn them, I am afraid that we will still have the feeling that weeds cannot be burned out completely. The power of these old novels is really terribly great; it is said that in the past, the number of books printed each year by the bookstores in Suzhou that specialize in printing old novels was greater than the total number of books printed each year by Commercial Press, World Book Company, and China Book Company combined. Now that there are no new children's books in Shanghai, it is even more of an opportunity for old novels to expand their power.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that the writers and publishers in Shanghai will shift some of their attention to children's books and create some happiness for our suffering children.</p>
<h3>The Advantages and Disadvantages of the "Foreman System"</h3>
<p>— Yi Peng</p>
<p>After reading the news about the fight among Fuxin Flour Factory workers, I thought of an "off-topic" question, which is whether the "foreman system" should exist.</p>
<p>The so-called "foreman system" means that workers do not directly have relationship with the capitalists, and all responsibilities are handled by the foreman in the middle. This is indeed a convenient system for small-scale factories, because small factories do not produce much, and work is sometimes available and sometimes not, so capitalists cannot employ workers on a long-term basis. With the foreman introducing workers, they can have the foreman summon workers when there is work, which is a win-win situation in terms of time and economy. But the problem arises here. The large number of unemployed people is an undeniable fact. Everyone wants to compete for a job, and they naturally have to obey the foreman who has the power of life and death. As a result, the foreman's exploitation is endless, such as "tributes" and "commissions," which consume most of the workers' hard-earned money, while the foreman sits back and enjoys the benefits. In today's world where the cost of living is rising, goods are being traded through consumer cooperatives to avoid the profiteering of middlemen, but workers who earn a living by their labor are instead subjected to the exploitation of foremen. This is really a bad system. At the same time, larger factories indirectly suffer many intangible losses from the "foreman system": because the foreman uses the workers' "tributes" as the selection standard, the work efficiency of the workers he summons is naturally out of the question, and the waste of raw materials and damage to machinery invisibly cause losses to the factory. Therefore, small factories may not be able to temporarily adopt the "foreman system" in practice. In general, larger factories should adopt the "foreman system" in order to ensure the quality and speed of their products and avoid all intangible losses, while workers can also receive higher wages and work with peace of mind. This is not only beneficial to both parties, but also avoids disputes caused by the foreman's exploitation.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 22: News Flew in From Afar, Lofty Discussions Inspired Faith</p>
<p>Wu Junsu: In the past, Chinese people had an old saying, "A scholar who does not go out knows the affairs of the world." This means that scholars have broad knowledge and understand everything. Now we can change the word "scholar" to "reporter who does not go out knows the affairs of the world." As a journalist, sitting quietly in a small room, news from all over the world will come to your hands. This not only broadens your knowledge, but is also a gift of science, right? Qu Wushuang smiled and said, "After the development of the news business, news does not come in through the front door, but flies in from the roof. There used to be such a joke. Now, news really doesn't come from the front door, but from the roof. Since the invention of electricity, just as Junsu sister said, major world events can all be gathered in a small room. Moreover, at this moment, it is not only language and text that can be transmitted electronically, but also photographs. For example, if a meeting is held in a place thousands of miles away today, we can use this telephoto, cast a copper plate, and see it in the newspaper tomorrow morning." As they chatted and walked, they saw several small rooms next to the large room of the editorial department. Looking inside, it was very quiet and elegant, and there were glass bookcases all around. However, there were very few people there at the moment. Qu Wushuang said, "These few rooms are writing rooms, because the editorial department feels too noisy, so these rooms were arranged for writers and reviewers to write in peace. Now the trend in newspapers is that for essays, they should be improvised on the spot. For example, if an important news comes in the middle of the night, an essay must be written in the middle of the night to point out a path for everyone. As for whether it is long or short, it doesn't matter. Or, if a piece of news comes too late to express a long essay, then a short and concise commentary must be provided. You must know that newspapers represent public opinion, not simply report news as a kind of mouthpiece. Only by establishing rigorous arguments and fair comments can we preside over the discussion in the press. I remember that in the past, there were some cowardly newspapers that had no comments at all, and even if there were comments, they talked about irrelevant things. These newspapers are all escaping reality, timid and hesitant. Such newspapers may have been able to sell well in China before the war, when the level of newspaper readers was shallow. But at this moment, no one would read them anymore. Therefore, the few gentlemen who write and comment in our newspaper are all insightful and deeply understand politics, economics, and social sciences. A single article will attract the attention of the masses, and at least every event will give people a basic knowledge. Only then can we see the value and authority of the newspaper. If we have one million readers, we can gain the faith of one million readers."</p>
