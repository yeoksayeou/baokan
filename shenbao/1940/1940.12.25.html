<h3>佳節的兩件禮物</h3>
<p>十二月二十五日眞是普天同慶的佳節：是偉大中國的民族復興節，是雲南起義的紀念日，又是耶穌聖誕日。所以雖在這樣烽火連天的世界上，也還有痛痛快快慶祝一下的意義。何况在這佳節前後，歷史老人却又給人類文明的前途，携來了不少禮物；其間最新鮮的兩件，一是中國第二屑參政員人選的正式公佈。第二件，是英國當政者陣容的局部變更。這杲兩個獨立事件；但在這時候却象徵着兩個共同的意義。</p>
<p>首先，是象徵着更加團結。中國參政員的人選，象徵着中華民族的國內外，各地域，各民族，各黨各派的澈底大團結。這一點和第一屆是完全一樣；所不同的，這一屆所象徵團結的程度，更加普遍而緊密了。英國當政者陣容的局部變更，是象徵着英美兩國間及英國內部各派別的一致大團結。以新任哈立法克斯爲駐美大使，艾登接任外相，及傳說中的路易喬治入閣負責料理國內糧食與戰器製造等問題，從這三個舉措來說，哈立法克斯是英國現任的貴族外相，依照向來英國死硬派傳統輕視美國的心理，這的確不能不算對美國特圳表示敬意的破天荒之舉。在美國那一方面，哈立法克斯本來常被歸入張伯倫一類的典型，在美國的人望，比起艾登或路易喬治來，都差得遠。當洛齊安出缺的時候，曾有艾登調任駐美大使的傳說，不久之前，又有路易喬治使美的傳說，但都未成事實。現在値得注意的，美國居然接受而且朝野一致歡迎哈立法克斯的使美，這足以表示美國對英國現政府整個國策的完全信任；更値得注意的，今而後，在一般美國人眼裏代表英國當前國運的邱吉爾執政之下，再加上艾登，路易喬治等人的担任要責，則英美間將來的合作，祗有一天一天密切起來。再從央國國內說，哈立法克斯在今年春天張伯倫下台後，仍然能留任外相，已經出於大家意料之外。英國的輿論及有名人物像威爾斯等人，曾一再主張爲了與德義作戰到底，哈立法克斯應當立刻去職。可是其間一直爲他辯護的，却是他以前的政敵邱吉爾。一九三八年春天艾登的所以辭去外相，其一部份原因，就因爲與哈立法克斯的外交主張不同的緣故；而現在則一任外相，一任駐美大使，可見其間的關係，如何通力合作。至於路易喬治的入閣，如果成爲事實，則英國三大政黨之一的自由黨，又多一個領袖參加担負戰時國家的重責，這將不僅是路易喬治個人的行動，而且也是英國自由黨的重要決定。在英國當政者及各政黨這樣合作團結的氣氛裏，未來的英國人民及輿論，勢必也更趨强化。</p>
<p>其次，是象徵着澈底的決心。不久以前，日本曾大肆其「和平攻勢」，但立刻就被中國各當局的堅決表示所粉碎。這幾天來，又換了手法，施其「謠言攻勢」。這個第二届參政員人選的公佈，就是鐵一樣的證據，足以證明日方各報近來所載種種離奇消息的完全無稽。對於中國的澈底決心，無論敵友，現在都應該毫無含糊，曲解及妄想的餘地了。至於英國當政人員這次的調動，是對德義表示作戰到底的決心，亦是對一切反侵略及牠的同盟國家，表示着堅守自己的一再誓言，一直戰至恢復所有歐洲被暴力征服國家自由爲止的決心。蓋從艾登一九三入年二月去職時起，一直到現在爲止，正是歐洲大陸被征服各國先後失去自由獨立的時期。雖然牠們被征服的方式各有不同：西班牙共和政府，被所謂「不干涉政策」生生縊斃，當爲英法當時對德義談判的代價，而送給了墨索里尼及希特拉；奧國是在英國默許下，被德國裏應外合一舉加以佔領的；捷克斯拉夫是由於「慕尼黑會議」而失去了獨立和自主；亞爾巴尼亞郤是由於英國對義大利在東南歐可以自由發展的默認下，被義大利佔領的；其餘的波丹，挪比，荷，法等國，却都是武力的直接結果。但不管如何，牠們都是張伯倫徘斥艾登後，固執執行自己一派外交路綫的直接或間接的犧牲品。再向上回溯，從一九三四年艾登任掌璽大臣時起，一九三五年調任外相，一直到一九三八年春天的去職；這期間，他一再爲國際聯盟各種反對及裁制侵略的原則而奮鬥；及其最後的去職，也正是特別因爲在對義外交上，與張伯倫及哈立法克斯等人主張完全牴觸，及受到墨索里尼的重大壓迫與要挾撤換的緣故。所以在當時的英國，他是張伯倫內閣調整對義邦交企圖中的最大阻礙；但去職之後，郤受到全英國的愛戴，認爲是英國對外重大屈辱的殉難者，一直就成爲英國的國際聯盟路綫及精神的具體象徵了。艾登的現在回任外相，墨索里尼第一個就應該頭痛。在德國認爲最大敵人邱吉爾的主政之下，又加上義大利最大對頭的艾登外交，假如再加上第一次歐戰時擊敗德國的路易喬治的話，那末，今後德義引誘英國談判「和平」的幻想，格外應當完全放棄了。至於一再被國聯「譴責」「不承認」等處罰過的東方暴力主義者，由這裏，當然也更可指明牠今後與英國之間關係的必然形勢了。</p>

<p>維持法幣、穩定匯率、國府向具決心、法定外匯、始終不變、並授權外匯平準基金管理委員會辦理之、上海金融市塲、因某銀行將開幕，以致投機者復施故技、乘機造謠、以圖牟利、外匯黑市扒風盛熾異常、英商匯豐麥加利兩銀行、受香港平準委會電託、儘量供給、維持黑市、於是黑市匯率昨卽放長、</p>
<p>人心一變</p>
<p>上海外匯黑市塲之謠言、均係因某銀行將開幕而起、謂財政部將改訂商業匯兌率、上海匯豐銀　將停止黑市外匯掛牌、關於貝賣外匯移港辦理、中國政府對上海黑市停止維持、因此造成投機者之牟利、但以上所述，均係無精謠言、如改訂商業匯兌率、中央銀行已予吾認、匯豐銀行照常掛牌、中國政府繼續維持、業已有事實證明、所以昨島開市後、因匯豐掛牌不動、人心一變、</p>
<p>打擊套匯</p>
<p>本市黑市金融、於前日突起波動之後、昨日情形、已趨穩定、據平明社記者昨向消息靈通之金融界權威方面探悉、黑匯之緊縮、實爲打擊套匯之必要對策、此間中外銀行界現一致深信、中政府對於未來正當商人之外匯供給、必予維持、蓋平準基金委員會之外匯基金、事實上極爲充分、但每於有大量套匯時、殊不得不任其緊縮、而予以打擊、</p>

<h3>平民照限價購米　竟遭米店拒絕　法當局昨佈告決無米荒之虞　米評會昨晨又評定各檔米價　公倉儲米議案昨已決定</h3>
<p>據英文大學晚報消息、米價飛漲中、上海市民今日（二十四日）忽遭逢嚴重困難、因數家米號、茍非其出售價格、能超出米糧評價委員會之限價以上，則拒絕出售、凡購買米糧者、仍照限價購買、則米店一致諉稱、該店現已無貨可售、若購米者於暗中每石多付幾元、超過限價以上則仍可購得大宗米糧、今日下午、工部局特召集米商、在工部局內開會、對此問題、作全部檢討、據若干方面相信、米商或將與某方交涉、俾自租界以外各區、運米入內、以解除一時局勢、據觀察家稱、租界存米極豐、應不致發生米荒現象、</p>
<p>評定米價</p>
<p>上海市米糧評價委員會、以米市暗盤未戢、米價不斷上漲、特於昨晨十時、假愛多亞路豆米業公會、召開緊急會議出席者全體評價會委員、主席陳子彝、報吿米市情况後、卽評定本月九日未甘評定之每石米價、（一）一號暹邏米八十九元、（二）安南米菉七十八元、（三）一二號西貢混合碎七十六元、（四）高東京臼米七十九元、（五）東京糙米七十五元、復評定每包價格如下、（一）一號西貢一百〇四五元、（二）號西貢九十八元、（三）小絞米九十七元、一二號西貢混合碎米九十一元、本月九日評定之每石米價、仍照舊爲一號西貢八十七元、二號西貢八十一元五角、二號暹邏米八十元、最高小絞米八十六元、小絞米七十九元、</p>
<p>法方佈告</p>
<p>昨法租界當局佈吿云、茲據公董局食米委員會吿稱、（一）　南總督爲維持四貢米統制之效力起見、特頒佈條例、禁止於交付訂米時、以　貨代投等交付、故十二月間因暫時禁止出口而被取消之頭好米噸數、不得以同噸數之二號米代之、但於二月份卽可交付、（二）擬於一月份至少以十萬包西貢米裝運來滬、以維持上海存米量之平街、就目前上海存米之數量，及二月一日前從西貢或其他處運來之米之數量觀之、滬人食糧、可無庸憂慮，查西貢於二月份卽有新米裝出、故決不致有靑黃不接之慮、按此次西貢米出口之限制、完全因防止陳米消耗殆盡而起、故擬於二月份將此項限制取消之、總之、上海決無米荒之慮、</p>
<p>公倉會議</p>
<p>公共租界工部局爲集議公倉儲米問題、曾函邀各、業領袖，於昨（二十四）日下午二時、在該局會議廳開會、討論設置公倉辦法、討論結果、（一）訂購洋米二十萬包、成立公倉，當塲認購者、計爲虞洽卿三萬包、米業雜糧業六萬包、銀錢業五萬包、紗廠業二萬包、麵粉業一萬包、煤業五千包、新藥業及製藥業二千五百包、棉花業二千包、棉布業二千包、糖業一千五百包、五金業一千五百包、呢絨業一千包、營造業五百包、木業五百包、合計十八萬六千五百包、其餘一萬三千五百包、由捲烟業及百貨公司等酌量分認、不足之數、仍由虞洽卿認購、（二）成立公倉管理委員會、推定委員九人、負責綜理其事、其人選計爲虞洽卿·徐寄廎（代表市商會）·王禹卿（代表麵粉業）·何德奎·曁銀錢業代表兩人、米業代表兩人、紗廠業代表一人、並決定由兩租界工部局推派代表各一人、處於該委員會之監督地位、至於銀錢業·米業·及紗廠業代表、至遲於三天內推定、報告工部局、一俟委員人選齊全、卽日召開委員會首次會議、討論一切進行事宜、（三）上項公倉之管理、集中一處、買賣賬目、按月公布一次、盈虧歸公賬攤派、並委托目前稽查工部局賬目之外籍會計師（Thomson＆Co）每三個月查賬一次、</p>
<h3>新生新裕兩紗廠　發生怠工風潮　滬西紗廠工人亦提要求　各業勞資糾紛陸續興起</h3>
<p>大陸報云、昨日（二十　日）據勞工界聲稱、本市兩紗廠三千工人、與廠方起爭執、苟不立卽解決、則上海全體紗廠工人、恐將表示同情而罷工、果爾各紗廠皆將停業、查上述兩紗廠爲東京路之新生紗廠與蘇州路之新裕紗廠、其工友於月餘前向廠方提出要求、未接答覆、遂於星期日夜間相率念工、</p>
<p>爲首工人　已遭拘捕</p>
<p>兩廠主深恐工友怠工後、有劇烈行動、請公共租界警務處予以援助、警方乃派捕乘裝甲車與警備車馳往保護、並逮捕鼓動罷工之工友的十人、據勞工界消息、被捕者屢受警方盤詩、尙未釋出、該兩紗廠中人、則以工友並未宜布罷工、故仍有完全解決可能爲言、</p>
<p>滬西紗廠　赤手影響</p>
<p>同時、傳聞共他紗廠（多在滬西）亦呈不寗之象、衆料各紗廠工友的十餘萬人、均將要求增加工資與米貼、吾則以罷工相威脅、昨日新生與新裕兩廠工作、仍吿完全停頓、勞工界謂非待廠方依允工友要求則不致恢復工作、</p>
<p>針織技師</p>
<p>又上海針織廠技師約千人罷工已數日，其代表昨日與資方賡續談判、消息靈通人士謂不久有解決之望、聞針織業工友的二萬人、對於技師罷工、已表同情、故廠方亟欲雙方爭執立卽解決、</p>
<p>搬塲汽車　工友要求</p>
<p>本市沙發業工友的人、日僱主提求、多未獲准、故昨仍罷工中、恐一時不易解決、上海搬塲汽車公司工友千餘人、上週曾向資方要求提高工資與米貼、工友代表相信彼等無需罷工、因資方有依從工友要求、而僅略加修改之勢也、</p>
<p>紗廠工人　要求强硬</p>
<p>又上海泰晤士報云、昨日消息、西區紡織工友工會會員的三十萬人、頃向紗廠廠主提出若干種增加工資與改善待遇之要求、有組織的工人工會向資方直接交涉、以保障工人利益者、多年來尙屬初次、工會提出之要求、以「最後通知書」形式出之、措辭強硬、說明要求若遭拒絕、則工會保留自由行　之權、</p>
<p>其他各方　紛請加薪</p>

<p>公共汽車收入　激增說不確</p>
<p>本埠英商中國公共汽車公司、近以百物昂貴、支出激增、爰於本月十七日始、增漲票價百分之三十五、聊資挹注、事後有傳該公司漲價　每日收入、可由五萬元增至六萬七千五百元者、茲向可靠方面探悉、所謂收入增加云云、盡係推測之詞、不足憑信、</p>

<h3>耶誕之夜</h3>
<p>— 韋亞君</p>
<p>又是耶誕節了，雖然從來沒有唱過「吾主耶穌」的讚美詩，軋鬧猛却不肯放過機會，更何况，「孤島」上的空氣這樣悶人！</p>
<p>於是，日歷上的數字剛踏進十二月，百貨公司，糖菓舖干的橱窗裏已經發現了白鬚紅袍的聖誕老人的足跡，那棉花襯設的背景又是多麽潔靜，再加上「串福袋」中的高貴禮品，祇要你的眼睛有餘閑和她接觸一下的話，你就會下意識地輪着你的手指，註算着今天離耶穌誕節有多少日子，或者更精密地計算出她是星期幾。這樣，你已經胸有成竹，—就是在本月份的薪水名下，（或許還有雙薪和意外的花紅呢）！提出若干份之幾來作爲這個「佳節」的開支力你這樣想，你的朋友也這樣想，你的親戚何嘗不是這樣想？</p>
<p>這個肅殺的季節，就顯得活潑而燦爛了；美麗的窗飾遮　了流浪兒童的醜態；忽忙的行色忍略了脚尖邊的「倒路屍」；而那種興高采烈的情緒，自然再不會注意到這大都市中還有着無數愁苦的臉相！</p>
<p>恭祝耶誕，X‘Mas　Sale’個如火如荼的「佳節」一直延長到昨天晚上。</p>
<p>這一晚，彷彿會見久別的情人，也彷彿我到靈魂的寄托之所。電影院；映着恭祝佳節的巨片，勞萊哈台叫你笑得合不攏嘴，而「迎風戶半開」又是多麽纏綿悱惻的羅曼史啊！菜館里：紅紫紅帔的菓盤配着銀色的刀叉，香檳酒中的泡沫中映着歡笑的面容，而暖室中的空氣，不是和春大一樣的溫馨嗎？舞廳里：高貴的「小姐」們展開着一個像好萊塢電影中所看到的時裝展覽會，爵士音樂與夏威夷情歌在話筒中瘋在地旋轉着，「不歡更何待？」</p>
<p>總之，這里沒有時間，沒有世界，同時也損失了生命！</p>
<p>可是，黎明終於從綴着　絡的窗帘中透了進來，而送着這一羣失落了靈魂的人們歸家的也正是爲他們所忽視的人們</p>
<p>日子已進展了一天，這羣人的勞力推動着整個都市的機構。</p>

<p>東新橋畔三四三　大滬飯店、於昨日下午一時許、有旅客兩名、御玄色大衣、手中均携皮包、當經招待導登六樓六〇五號房間、每日房金十一元、隨付法幣五十元、具名爲蘇州人楊樂　、年三十八歲、業商、迨侍者進茶水後、即關閉房扉、談笑甚權、迨三時左右、召八號侍者（揚州人陸傳賢年逾三旬）入內、着購南翔饅頭兩碟、</p>
<p>兇手圖逃茶房扭獲</p>
<p>迨陸購賣點心退來、聞有呼救聲，出自該號、遂放下點心、亟飛步入內、詎房扉乍啟、兇犯卽奪門外逸、當卽扭獲、並瞥見楊樂安左額角及面部已被戳兩刀、血如泉湧、受創殊劇、地板上幷拋棄利刃一柄，亟用電話報告該管麥蘭捕房、迅派中西趕探馳往，嗣將兇手帶入捕房兇器存案、據悉兇犯名徐澤、年二十一歲、蘇州人、服靑布長衫、甫於昨晨與傷者乘車來滬、因採購貨物、擬留滬小住、因見傷者法幣纍纍、頓起不良之念、擬加以殺害後、得財遠颺、一切直認不諱、</p>
<p>眼珠凸出恐成殘廢</p>
<p>事後記者馳往調查時、瞥見房內銅床斜倚、棕棚倒地、想見當塲動手時、傷者或許橫臥於床次、致有劇烈之掙扎、床褥及地板、皆滿濺血汚、玻桌上遺有五分鎳幣三枚、據聞受傷者經救護車飛送廣慈醫院療治、時左眼珠業已凸出、勢成殘發，</p>

<h3>糧食　洋米又寬放限價　但暗盤已高結果恐還是提高貼費西貢來米三萬餘包足證禁運不確</h3>
<p>昨日米市、又在奔騰之中、雖一般受限之貨、未見出樣、但一些不受限各貨、異常俏俐、迺以今日雲南起義紀念日、市塲照例休假一天、致引起本鄕店胃爲未雨綢繆計、均在添備、一時買氣頓旺、致洋米再見抬高二三元、然限價表面尙未打破、惟貼價之風氣更見活潑、貼價又自五六百元加至七八百元一百包、雜色各米因投機者不甚注重、交易反少、而行情則同被抬高一二元或三四元、尤以碎尖八十一元最見高昂、英華司原包與米菉相等、昨由當局補充限價、計一號西貢現貨一百〇四元、二號九十八元、小紋九十七元、米菉七十八元、碎米七十六元、並有阻止掮客入市塲、以期實施取締、但昨日一號現西貢原包已開到一百十元、碎米八十一元半、米菉八十三元半、早已超出限價、今後賣買，或須增加許多貼費而已、在西買禁阻與定價不劃之宣傳下、昨日乃有反證不確之新事實、蓋新交易　有西貢一號二千噸成交也、合義售出、一月下期裝、價爲一百〇二元六角、回籠交易因投機活潑、成交有一千二三百噸、現貨亦達一萬四五千包、</p>
<p>洋米昨日續有到埠、法公司（SSGR　GL　AVARENNE）號輪、由西貢直接運來三萬餘包、昨午抵滬停虹口順泰碼頭起卸、又太古公司四川輪、自香港裝來六百五十一包、昨晨進口停靠浦東、定今日移泊法租界外灘本行碼頭起卸、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米來源旣續不旺、而銷塲方面、一般作客因感採購洋米之不易、日價格已相差無幾、故多改推粳貨、一時去路頓旺、售價並見騰升二元之砠、計開崑山斛見白粳一百零三元至一百元、靑角薄稻斛見九十三元至九十一元、原包九十八元、</p>
<p>糯米昨忽轉緊、蓋因往常銷路素細、價格較他貨常廉、茲際洋米擯持環境、一般人目光遂都轉栘於糯米、致在多方採購之下、市面頓時激昂一二元之譜、開宜溧白元九十八元、香港白元八十六元七角至八十四元半云云、</p>
<h3>粉市續漲　——洋粉已爲投機工具——</h3>
<p>麪粉昨日續趨昂挺、蓋以囤戶搜購、不遣餘力、進戶不問貴賤、貨主趁此拉抬、鐘樓及花鳥牌澳粉漲達二十二元八角新高峰、野猪及美麗牌均破二十三元大關、其漲風已屬可觀、惟後市因耶誕休假、囤戶稍見出籠、花鳥牌價由二十二元八角步鬆至二十二元四角半、結果與前日最高價相仿、統市成交的計二萬餘包、脚地尙穩、</p>
<p>小麥昨日堅俏如常、各粉廠均感原料缺乏、進買當然貪取、惟目下供源久乏、欲購無貨、聞華廠收進近郊麥二百餘包、價爲三十二元半、而喊價已逾三十三元、故市面不脫堅持之局、</p>
<h3>金融　謠風究屬無稽　外滙復歸寗靜</h3>
<p>外匯昨日巾况、滙豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美滙暗市、反動回長、市况稍形安寗、究無較有根據之消息、投機者憑空揑造、亦至此而盡、故本日午盤　投機商獲利者已吐、其他進出均有、且滙豐等外行對先令美匯俱多供給、午刻市面已吿破化、後市日銀行傾售，　狀奇硬、美　時做去元半、惟投機商仍有乘賤結納者、致晚收回平、現貨先令吿三辦士四三七五、美滙五元四三七五、比上日英長〇三一二五、美鬆〇九三七五、今明後三天爲中外銀行假期、循例休市、</p>
<p>外銀行有塞出</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠期均升〇六二五、紐約銀行仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對學滬等不動、美對英求更、對滬跌二角六分，對法俱無市、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士三七五、美滙五元三七五、較之上日晚收英緊〇三一二五、美則反硬〇三一二五、開後市面又吿不穩乃投機商已來扒結、計美行等售予下月份美匯五元三四三七五、九時半滙豐掛牌各滙勿動而此後滙豐及麥加利供塞先令約十餘萬鎊、潛勢稍鬆、計現先令外行進　豐等三辦士四〇六二五、美滙亦見回長、計華比銀行吸入外行下月份美滙五元四〇六二五、迨至午刻、投機家入市吐出、市面續硬、計本月份　匯投機商賣予滙豐爲五元四　七五、午收變化少、現貨先令三　士四三七五、美滙五元四三七五、</p>
<p>日銀行亦求售</p>
<p>後市開後日銀行求售、爲狀愈鬆、計正金出外行本月份美滙五元半、惟不少投機商又乘賤　購致走勢吿定、投　商吃進外行本月份美滙亦爲五元半、嗣以投機商繼續需　，個趨回平、計入外行下月份美滙五元四三七五、並本月份美　五元四六八七五、結果晚收觀貨及本月份英金三辦士四三七五、美滙五元四三七五、下月份英金三辦士四〇六二五、美　五元四〇六二五、比隔　收市英金期現長〇三一二五、美滙鬆〇九三七五、</p>
<p>天津匯市軟縮</p>
<p>天津二十四日（週二）電今日匯市開盤呆滯、倫敦電　軟、二〇三一二五、爲三便士八一二五、紐約電滙縮三四三七五、爲六元〇三一二五、申匯升五角、爲八十九元、「　鈔」　　微昂二角五分、爲八十十元五角、</p>

<h3>獲利不乏出籠　金價稍起反動　一度跌至六四四〇元</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗盤梢起反動回跌、價已盤入六千六百元大關內、一度曾破六千五百元關、謠風雖較平息、各方人心則仍在恍忽中、但大戶多頭證劵幫金號與某銀號滬西多頭公司已在獲利出籠中、自晨開市六千六白元、卽遭出籠之風襲擊、續見在退八十元、但在大漲後不免餘波、小錢莊之傾進、頓在抬風中又飛上見六千六白八十　、奈外匯報鬆、現金號亦起傾出、漲風不久卽息、價步趨在落、下午美金硬至五元五三一二五、滙票商銀號拋售、出籠之風更盛、再降至六千四白四十元低價、見低買方父來活勸、另一現金號之傾進、又抬起一百五十元漲勢、終爲六千五百七十元、軋小四十五元，照一月期美滙五元四〇六二五結價、爲六千四百六十二元、竟抬高一百〇〇八元、全日交易一萬五千兩、現金初與期交價平、後低三五元、未做開、首飾金最小掛六百六十元、後六百七十元軋小五元、關金等均平、至今天雲南起義紀念、中外銀行休假、明天爲外國冬至、洋商銀行續假一天、故金市外滙兩市、亦均各休假二天云、</p>
<p>烚赤跌四十五元</p>
<p>晨初檯面無動靜、開盤金號出銀號廿兩、六千六百元、比上日晚收做低十五元、不久銀號帮猛售、滬西多頭公司獲利了結賣出、致跌落達八十元、計證劵幫出銀號廿兩、六千五百廿元、但不久塲內又起某種利多謠言、錢兌業等掀動買風、竟在抬至上日最高價、計錢兌業入金號廿兩、爲六千六百八十元、後聞外匯鬆動、現金號來市吐售、價復挫降、計銀號出證券帮卅兩、爲六千五百三十元、午刻散戶搜撈、止跌回升、計銀號進證劵帮廿兩、爲六千五百八十五元、收盤銀號出金號卅兩、六千五白六十元、午後開盤因滙市續硬、賣風隱的、人心較萎、計銀號對做廿兩、爲六千五百二十元、後以銀號帮購進、一度拉高至六千五白五十元、但銀號帮某號又大施賣出壓力時、維持較少、終被撳落至六千四百四十元低價、然未幾金號某大戶力進、一躍又挺至六千五百九十元、結果吿六千五百七十元、比上日軋小四十五元、全日上落二百四十元、現金號之本牌金售價、較烚赤高十餘元、收進低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>首飾金掛小五元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、上午未更、下午二時低五元、三時續小十元、叫時重升十元、結果大同行縣六百七十元、新同行與上價相仿，收進低三十元云、</p>
<h3>貼現飛躍上升</h3>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、突吿飛　、每千元貼出竟步高達六元半、貼　爲六元、比上日升四元、綫業公會拆息反見掛小一分、早午兩市均掛六分云、</p>
<h3>美幣略降</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價、起落倏忽、終稍趨疲、英學金鎊因亦各降一元、英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票會退至十八元三角、卒又高至十八元六角、比上日終落二角半、香港蔡需耍仍殷、晚市高至四元三角半、坎拿大及菲列濱票等均稍趨疲、日金票跌後稍回、卒吿下落五厘、晚市爲一元六角一分半、朝鮮票供求均勻、晚市仍站一元三角三分原價、</p>
<h3>證券　債市依然無神</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨日初開頗形軟弱、生大鴻大多頭出籠、協康補空十餘萬後、行市維持不動、繼因同康買進的四十萬、順昌進戊種的十萬、聯益亦稍有抵補、但姓昶易中父有多頭出籠甚湧、鼎康亦有乙種賣出、　市價稍有畸形、結果丙種因補空尙略好五分、餘均微小一二角、九六小叫角、在目下環境中、前途殊不易看好矣、半日成交約一百四五十萬元、（下午辦理當日交割停市、因二十五六日兩日係耶節休假無市、）茲列表於左、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交閘北水電股二百股、價爲九元二角半、</p>
<p>又衆業公所股市、因逾額多頭出籠、價格趨向下游、外匯波動猛烈、股價隨之倐上倐落、但結果終於軟化、此殆亦因假期迫近之故、橡皮股升降靡常、亦與匯市同進退、全日各股成交甚鉅、</p>
<p>倫敦二十三日（週一）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛脾行市、概吿平滯、股票上落甚微、有利銀行股上升二先令六便士、價十鎊十七先令六便士、古拉客林傍樣皮股跌落八便士半、爲十五先令三便士、其餘不動、</p>
<h3>紗花　同業多額稍出　紗價小回</h3>
<p>上日飛漲之紗布　則又復平靜、而回挫一步、此因外滙暴縮後亦轉硬而稍長、於是空頭又來活動而拋賣、同時有一部份某某同業、將多額逐步放出、心思看淡一檔、所以內行大都不看漲、一遇機會、突來放空、因此紗市之曲折頻繁、至於「外客方面」、據言逢高稍出、見低必進、兩方扯下、仍以出少進多、可想雙方爭持之烈也、不過實需較昔爲活、而雜牌紗價亦漸漸提高矣、昨有棉紗、一百三十五件運香港、</p>
<p>雙　晨開因上日午後空方大有心慌意亂之象，抬價補進、已做至一千四百十二元、首盤承上日市氣續昂、二十支雙馬價爲一千四百元、直升至一千四百〇九元、有一部份盈利者出籠、忽然跌至一千四百元內、旋聞外滙略長、再疲至一千三百九十元、但低價一現、扒補及多方吸收相繼而來、復漲至一千四百〇七元、惟同業中某某等對於雙馬拋出、同時因明日爲雲南起義紀念日停市、浮多吐出、市盤乃轉、下降至一千三百八十元、然多方意態鎭靜勿動、漲至一千三百九十元、收盤稍收爲一千三百八十五元、查牛日間成交統計七千四百二十五包、行情二十支雙馬跌八元、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、同行七、二〇〇香港　二六五內地　一〇統計七、四二五</p>
<p>午後紗市帶昂、始做價爲一千三百八十八元至八十九元、旋後稍見軟化、價爲一千三白七十九元、最後因取引所同好、價一千三白八十二元、</p>
<h3>棉商不願賤售</h3>
<p>現棉交易雖不發展、然執貨者心意殊强、因紗布步升棉價未能跟踪前進、所以不願賤售、叫價頗高、以致成交不旺也，</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市靜寂、股票價格之不振、及海外商之賣出、結果收盤價格較之上日降落三四磅音、印度昨日連同預測降落二羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來姝見靜寂、各方俱不以滙兌之緊縮、而大量之購買、故棉價未見高翔也、然同業却始終抱定不買與不賣爲原則、目前棉價、抑低太巨、故日後之棉價仍看高也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　新買停手　棉布售盤微軟</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市盤旋、迭有起仆、結果微鬆、蓋以紗市大漲小回、人心澹薄、且吸胃頗足、新買戶價高停手、非有新刺激不易再漲、售盤粗布平平、細斜細布跌每疋二角半至五角、漂染布價少變更、本街成交各布四百餘件、粤港帮辦漂染布粗細布一百餘件、浙閩帮辦粗細布漂布府綢等一百數十件、北路烟台帮辦粗布色布一百餘件、今日有疋頭五百〇五件運香港、十一件運厦門、</p>
<p>東布　昨以連日暴漲過速、今明兩日又緣封關停市、故一般散戶獲利者、從事了結、賣氣頓盛、回風亦烈、龍頭細布最低盤降至三十一元三四角、嗣後又聞標金暗盤升騰、多頭加碼又升至三十二元一二角、收盤細斜交易不多、跌落一二角、嗶嘰一元二角二分五、亦跌三分</p>
<h3>雜糧　油豆漲風未息</h3>
<p>昨日汕豆餅雜糧市况、在種種鼓勵囤貨之崎形狀態下、其漲風繼續未息、惟豆油底貨　豐厚、趨勢轉平、交易大有廠油二百擔、價爲九十六元、大連油二百桶、價爲一百十八元至一百十七元五角、又訂一月上交八百桶、價爲一百十八元五角至一百十七元五角、花生油缺貨居奇、價漲一二元計成交膠州油二百件，價爲九十七元、陳貨一百五十件、價爲九十四五元、靑島油三十桶、價爲一百二十八元、陳貨五十桶、價爲一百二十六元、黃豆實銷囤戶兩旺、行情續挺一元外、計開天津豆二千餘包、父花皮豆四百餘包、靑島豆四百餘包、歸德豆七百包、及天津靑豆二百包云、</p>
<p>昨有豆子四百包、豆餅六千三百五十八塊、生仁六百包運厦門、運香港者有豆子二百九十包、豆餅九千六百二十塊、</p>
<h3>雜項　香烟停打棧單</h3>
<p>連日香烟行情、受外匯緊縮、暗盤漲風甚烈、而廠方停止同業冉打棧單、致人心恐慌、同行及一般外行囤戶、紛向市塲搜購、致市價愈趨緊張、昨如老刀牌做、一千〇二十元、大英牌一千三白八十元、品海牌九百元、五華牌七百元、仙女牌七百元、華成公司金鼠牌九百二十元、小美麗牌九百五十元、因各方買氣濃厚、仍看高漲、</p>

<h3>聖誕節</h3>
<p>— 水冗</p>
<p>「死鬼，什麽時候了，還攤屍！」老頭子一邊罵，一邊用脚狠狠地跌着挺睡在地上的小虎。</p>
<p>被跌的睡得正濃。陡的感到大腿上一陣疼痛，睜開半隻眼來，剛碰着老頭子的那對冒火的眼睛和一臉險惡的表情。「昨晚上……」鼻子裏哼出那麽幾個字。馬上揉揉眼，一骨碌爬起身，繫褲子了。</p>
<p>冬天的太陽蒼白地照着半面街。黑子那瘦小子畏怯地默在一旁。</p>
<p>「今天是洋菩薩的生日，該挑好一點的抓。回頭給你們——」老頭子說着，冒火的眼睛突變柔和了。但不知怎的，瞧着却比冒火的更怕。</p>
<p>小虎哼了一聲，偏着頭招呼黑子：「走」</p>
<p>兩個幷着肩，跑過那敎堂的大門。大門緊閉着。靜得做一座墳。</p>
<p>「黑子，昨晚上你沒聽見麽？這裏面的鬼子們，男的，女的，在靠我們那邊的草地上，咿吚呀呀的哼了一整夜，直哼到天亮。他媽的還跳舞呢！全攙着手，攙成一個大圈子，圈子裏是一顆什麽樹樹上掛滿紅紅綠綠的燈。那些鬼子們就圍着那顆樹跳着，唱着，笑着，……我是打籬笆縫裏望進去……鬧得老子一夜沒得好睡，還挨了他媽的幾下！」</p>
<p>黑子搖搖頭。這小子對什麽都是顫索索的，卽使對他的「師兄」。不像小虎一離開那可惡的老頭子，就像換了付骨頭，有說有笑。</p>
<p>「就是爲了什麽洋菩薩的生日吧。」</p>
<p>向右拐個灣，街上熱鬧起來。各色各樣的車子吼叫着，飛跑着。人們推擠着，叫喊着，爭鬧着。在一個電車站上，一對高貴的靑年夫婦，攙着一個白胖的女孩。「寳貝，等一會到了『兒童世界』，別忘記叫你爸爸買個洋哇哇。」秋波　着男子，兩人相視而笑了！</p>
<p>小虎不理會這些。扯着黑子往人堆裏擠。「喂，你爺爺在對你笑呢！」</p>
<p>黑子瞥一下廚窗裏的那個白鬍鬚，紅衣服的老頭兒。接着兩眼落在他背上那隻像襪子一樣的口袋。那才是叫他百看不厭的！口袋裏裝着軟麵包，還有用花花綠綠的洋紙裹着的什麽。看看，看看，叫人　嚥唾沫。不是一早晨還沒什麽下肚的麽？</p>
<p>再向左轉，街道顯得狹窄了，到處是菜葉，果皮。漸漸，街兩旁出現賣洋山芋，紅蘿葡，捲心菜，塌枯菜，……的攤子。有一股魚腥味隨着寒流在空中麗走着。揚着木棍的巡捕，在追逐沒有照會的女菜販。</p>
<p>小虎悠閒地吹起口哨來，兩手揷在神袋裏。他旁邊拖曳着黑子。越往前走，人聲越喧沸，耳膜也要給震破的。</p>
<p>「噓噓！」驀地小虎站住了，對黑子做了一個鬼臉，就掠過口子邊那個水菓攤，跑到菜塲裏面去了。黑子落在後面，不一會也跑進去了。</p>
<p>塲裏人頭擠動着。也有不少黃頭髮，藍眼睛的女鬼子，挽着籐籃，在磅洋山薯什麽的。脚踏在地上像踏在泥淖裏，濕膩膩的。一枝秤陡的打半空中飛下來，緊隨着一陣惡罵。。</p>
<p>『買不起買啥！廿四兩的秤要窮人的命麽？」</p>
<p>黑子兜呀兜的，兜到賣「舟山火鷄的　所。一個肥胖的女鬼子正在磅着一隻肥大的鷄。他一眼望見小虎站在她背後，正對自己目語。</p>
<p>那女鬼子在付錢了。黑子忐忑地跑過去，用左肘推擠她。</p>
<p>「擠什麽，小癟三！」女鬼子氣喘喘地操着「洋涇浜。」</p>
<p>「誰擠？我擠你麽？」</p>
<p>小虎想：「黑子那小子不「老舉，」聲音多抖！」可是他鬧起來了！他抓起那隻鷄就溜</p>
<p>「追！追！」</p>
<p>「抓住這小子，他是同黨！」</p>
<p>小虎耳邊似乎隱的聽到黑子的哭聲。他的心往下沉了。他使勁的跑，跑。跑了一陣，才舒一口氣：「媽的！」</p>
<p>「喂！拿一本去看看！「窮人都來歸我！』主這麽說。主保佑你！」</p>
<p>小虎這才發現自己已經離「老窠」不遠了。敎堂的大門洞開着。從裏面透出來衣衣烏烏的風琴聲，和着沉鬱的低唱：「榮耀！…」</p>
<p>老頭子站在籬笆邊，瞪着一對可怕的眼睛。「怎麽那麽慢？」</p>
<p>「黑子失了風！」一手遞過『膩」去。</p>
<p>「管他！那小鬼眞不行，得叫他嘗嘗。喏，好小子！買兩個油煎餅吃！」拍拍小虎的肩膀，提着鷄跑了。</p>
<p>小虎接過那兩張破爛的五分票，望着老頭子的背影，把拳頭幌了幾下。</p>
<h3>章臺柳</h3>
<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>（七）池水春寒</p>
<p>龍蟠虎踞的石頭城下，佈滿了腥風血雨，殺氣戰雲。淸兵破了揚城，史公殉　，明軍瓦解，長江上面　　旌旗，都是淸兵，雖有天塹也難攔阻，可謂金陵王氣黯然收了，弘光帝已棄城而走，遁往蕪湖，大小官吏逃遁的逃遁，投降的投降，許多難民扶老携幼，紛紛亂竄。平日笙歌鼎沸的秦淮河，也滿罩着死氣，珠簾繼閨間不見玉人，祗覩鬼影了。此時錢牧齋早已乘隙溜回虞山，對柳如是說道：「國家不幸而傾覆，我惟有一死報　了。其奈卿何？」柳如是很鎮定的說道：「我早已準備身殉，一切都不顧了。相公何必慌張」錢牧齋嘆了一口氣，將身坐在椅子裹，好似癱瘓了半截，站不起來。柳如是道：「京師已陷，守土者都四處遁逃，這是最可恥的事。惟有史公可法力抗胡虜，殉節楊州，留得天地正氣。我等計無復之，當然祗有追隨史公後摩，舍生取義了。」錢牧齋點點頭道：「也祗得這樣做便了，容我興卿痛飲三日，然後隨先皇帝於堆下。」柳如是心裏暗想你不能在南京死，却一溜烟的跑回家來，這已有後顧了。回家後又不能與家人訣別，盡忠報國。還要痛飲三天，然後殉節，爲什麽這樣遲遲作態呢？所以已有些不以爲然。但因伉儷間以前情愛甚篤，也許他對了我未免英雄氣短，兒女情深，一時難以捨却。楚霸王垓下之歌，也有虞兮虞兮奈若何之句。他雖非重瞳英武之流，亦難毅然死國，祗好原諒他些了。所以在這三天之中，牧齋躱在紅豆山莊裹，夜夜和柳如是相對痛飲醇酒，醉則高歌一闋。錢歌多奈之何哉的情調，而柳歌則頗有視死如歸的意氣。日間柳如是助着牧齋預理身後事務，敎訓兒女，隱居不出，母以父母爲念，所以家中人都知道尙書要殉國了。但在第三天的早晨，本邑知縣忽然親來拜見牧齋。柳如是初意不欲延見，而牧齋却盼咐下人許見，他到書齋裹去和知縣談了好多時候，知縣方纔吿別而去。柳如是問牧齋，知縣來見有何事商議？牧齋道：「他無非來問問我，倘然淸兵來時，怎樣對付，可以不致糜爛地方。」柳如是道：「相公對他怎樣說呢？」　（二〇）</p>

<h3>聖誕節的偉舉</h3>
<p>— 賈愚</p>
<p>聖誕節是在歡的節日，聖誕節互相　送禮品也是件風行的事。而好來塢的明星所收到的禮品，格外的多，因爲除了親友之外，更有一般崇拜他們（或她們）的影迷的禮物，因此明星們收到的禮物，多至數百，少也有數十。綜計其價値，當然是筆很大的數目。</p>
<p>今歲的聖誕節又到臨了，但是東亞西歐，都有不少人受到戰爭的洗禮二受苦了。紐的有一位司密斯（P．G．Smith）先生有鑒於斯，首先在報上提議，今年耶誕禮品改送現金，而受禮者將所得捐助國際紅十字會，用來救濟這班苦痛的人民。自從司密斯先生，登高一呼之後，居然有許多響應這舉動；在明星叢中，就有衛尼文。考爾門·卡洛兒·以及僑美攝影師黃宗霑等，都表示贊成此項偉羣。</p>
<p>這確實是偉舉，値得提倡的偉舉！</p>
<h3>上海戲校上演「持輪戰」</h3>
<p>— 雲</p>
<p>玉麒麟持輪大戰，一名宋江讓位，乃久經失傳之老戲。昔年老伶工王福壽（人稱紅眼四，藝極淵博。）曾保藏此秘本，後爲李洪春搜得，惟從未以此授人，故北平富連成社與戲曲學校以及其他劇團等均未嘗演過。去歲洪春膺騁史新舞臺，上海戲校乘李君　校參觀之便，請爲指導一切，李君除不時釗校授劇外，並慨以「持輪戰」秘本相贈。現戲校已排練純熟，擬於本月二十六日（星期三）日塲公演。唱作開打，倍極繁重，梁山好漢，一齊登塲，故戲名亦有稱「全都　星聚義」者。茲將賅劇重要節目列后：</p>
<p>一箭仇生擒文恭。祭晁蓋大快人心。忠　堂羣星聚義。取東昌俊義失機。玉麒麟持輪大戰。梁山泊智牧張淸。又他人演「曾頭市」時，多至「一箭仇」活捉史文恭爲止，「持輪大戰」係接積「一箭仇」以後之故實。凡看過「曾頭市」「大名府」「英雄義」者，更不可不看「持輪戰」，因首尾連貫，有始有終，擒史以後之劇情，悉於該劇中演出耳。</p>
<h3>耶誕與影界</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>好萊塢有兩位影星的生日，是正在耶誕節那天，這兩位的名字跟諸位一定很熟悉，就是亨茀來飽嘉　溫毛立斯。</p>
<p>本市大光明大戲院，在耶誕節所排的節曰，好像已有了定例；每年總逃不了是秀蘭鄧波兒主演的作品，上年的「小孤雁」前年的「小紅伶」，今年的「靑春時代」，不過這張已是她脫離銀壇前的最後一部影片；所以，明年大光明耶誕節的節目，恐怕會有變動了。</p>
<p>在戰前，每年到了耶誕節，倫敦的大小影院，都是通宵營業，今年政府已有吿示，過十二時必須打烊，否則將受警局處罰。</p>
<p>當今銀壇上紅得發紫的影星陳雲裳，原居香島，她第一次蒞滬的日期，影迷們還記得嗎？民國二十七年耶誕節下午四時左右俄國皇后輪帶來了一位南國驕兒，就是她呀！當天張善琨伉儷親赴碼頭迎迓，卽晚並在私邸爲之設宴洗塵。</p>
<p>薛爾維雪耐，以「蝴蝶夫人」一片而揚名四海，在影壇上已許久不作聲了。她預備今年耶誕節在她的私宅內招待一次影界同人聚宴，而乘此發表她「東山冉起」的意思。</p>
<p>美國有許多影院，耶誕這一天，除了以精彩的電影給各界仕女們欣賞外，觀衆有時還可以獲取享受豐厚菜饌的機會，他們並不需要出比平日高的代價。上海的情形適相反，逢星期或例假日，多數電影院反把座價提高呢。</p>
<h3>將參加「啼笑姻綠」演出之梅霞小姐</h3>
<p>— 杜鰲攝</p>
<h3>演完「紅粉喋血記」　夏霞將赴廣西結婚</h3>
<p>— 琳</p>
<p>離開了新華，夏霞差不多把全副精神放在話劇上了。這中間，雖然爲金星演了一部「秦淮世家」，但她曾表示，以後她的拍攝電影，將要經過一番選擇，無聊的電影，她是無論如何都不答應演的。她的經常工作，就是爲上海劇藝社演戲。她說：演一些她認爲有價恤的戲，這對她是一種精神上的安慰。可是，雖說她暫時是脫離電影界，而與新華似乎還有一點關係，就是她在「西施」中的一部份戲沒有完工。目前，夏霞正在排演着「紅粉喋血記」，那是于伶和吳琛台　的一個新作，由洪謨導演，打算在元旦上演的一個大戲。據接近夏霞的人傳出消息、她也許於演完「紅粉喋血記」之後，要離開上海，到廣西去。此去目的何在？我們不得而知。但，我們知道夏霞的未婚夫，由歐洲歸國後，卽在廣西做事。有人猜想夏霞或許是爲結婚而去的，那除了夏霞自己外，誰都小能加以證實了。</p>

<h3>British and American Far East Joint Defense; Opening Up Pacific Naval Stations; Guaranteed Cooperation from Australia; Strengthening Philippine Land, Sea, and Air Power</h3>
<p>Washington: Yesterday's news stated that the US Navy has drafted a "route" from Hawaii to Singapore. This route includes oil stations, supply stations, and mooring bases on Palmyra, Kanton, Howland, Baker, and the Samoan Islands, as well as Port Moresby and Darwin in Australia. According to sources, although a formal agreement has not been signed, cooperation from Australia has been guaranteed. It is reported that discussions are limited to formal talks. (24th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Singapore: Australian Army Minister Spender and Chief of General Staff Lieutenant General Sturdee have recently arrived here. Their visit is for important discussions with the British Far East Commander Brooke-Popham. These two Australian military leaders will spend Christmas here. (24th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Manila: It was announced here today that twelve US giant submarines, including the newly equipped USS "Squalus", arrived in Manila two weeks ago, making the strength of the US Asiatic Fleet unprecedentedly powerful. The US naval strength concentrated here now includes three cruisers, the "Houston", "Marblehead", and "Cincinnati", three destroyer squadrons, twenty-six long-range patrol bombers, the aircraft carrier "Langley", eighteen giant submarines, six torpedo boats, and a transport fleet. The "Squalus," one of the twelve newly arrived submarines, is 299 feet long and sank to a depth of 240 feet on May 23, 1939, before being salvaged. As for the army's first-line strength in the Philippines, it has reached a new peak, with 80 aircraft, including three squadrons of fighters, one squadron of reconnaissance aircraft, and one squadron of bombers. The 17th Pursuit Squadron of Selfridge Field has now acquired "Republic" fighters ordered from Sweden. The Air Force Department claims that the "Republic" fighter is the "most desirable" aircraft in the Far East, unmatched by any aircraft currently in the Far East. Nichols Field has been converted into a fighter base, while bombers and reconnaissance aircraft are stationed elsewhere. The current army strength includes 10,000 regular US Army troops, as well as the Philippine Constabulary and twelve divisions of trained regular army reservists from the Philippines. Philippine officials hope that Washington will allocate US$5 million for the expansion of the Philippine Army. So far, Washington has made no decision on whether the United States or the Philippines should be responsible for civil defense, including air defense and food stockpiling.

<h3>Japanese Spokesman; Waving the Flag and Shouting; Expressing Deep Approval of German and Italian Anti-American Remarks</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Cabinet spokesman Ishii made a statement to foreign reporters this morning. He quite agreed with the recent criticisms from Germany and Italy of American aid. However, the current situation has not reached the stage of invoking the Tripartite Pact. Ishii declined to express his views, stating that he agrees with Germany and Italy. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zurich: The "Basler Nachrichten" from Rome reports that representatives from Germany and Italy will meet soon to discuss a joint attitude toward the US policy and to negotiate a resolution on the Axis's relationship with France. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hepburn Released; US Naval Quality Superior</p>
<p>Washington: Secretary of the Navy Hepburn has completed an annual report on the current state of the US Navy, which has been released by the Navy Department. The content praises the strength of the US Navy, stating: "I am responsible and report to the people that they can trust our navy without doubt. In my view, the US Navy is unparalleled in the world in terms of loyalty, morale, skill, and personnel. Compared with any country on an equal footing, it will never lag behind. However, given the current international situation, we must quickly strengthen our national defense so that we can cope with any enemy alliance attacking us in both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Our goal is to have a sufficient fleet to maintain complete freedom of action in one ocean while still maintaining the strength to effectively safeguard security in the other. In addition, the recruitment of reserves for the army and air force has been approved by the authorities, and the navy also urgently needs to recruit sufficient personnel to serve on existing ships or those under construction." Since the release of this report, President Roosevelt has taken various measures, so US naval officers and soldiers can be fully staffed in the shortest possible time. (24th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Britain's New Foreign Secretary; Eden Takes Office; Chongqing Newspaper Comments on British Cabinet Reshuffle; Believing It Will Contribute to the Overall Situation in the Far East</h3>
<p>Stockholm: Britain's new Foreign Secretary Eden took office at 10:00 AM yesterday, returning to the former position he left to Halifax on February 21, 1938. Yesterday, Halifax and Eden discussed unresolved issues and handled private matters. (24th Huitong Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Central News Agency recently published a commentary on the British Cabinet reshuffle, saying that "Chongqing received the news this morning and was satisfied. Chinese sources unanimously believe that Lord Halifax's appointment as ambassador to the United States is a sign that the British government attaches importance to this position, and they believe that Halifax's appointment will further strengthen the already close Anglo-American cooperation. On the other hand, Eden's reassignment as Foreign Secretary will undoubtedly be welcomed by all of Britain's allies, because Eden's views and talents have long been recognized worldwide. His reappointment as Foreign Secretary will guarantee Britain's diplomatic victory. The Chinese are convinced that Eden's diplomatic experience will help develop reasonable diplomacy in the current chaotic situation, so that aggressive groups will respect international good faith and justice." The Chinese generally believe that Eden is more active and practical than others in opposing the use of appeasement towards aggressors, and they recall that Eden's previous split with the late Prime Minister Chamberlain was due to Chamberlain's appeasement of Germany. The Chinese all hope that after Eden's return as Foreign Secretary, Britain will adopt a more active diplomatic policy. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the current British Ambassador to China, was appointed by Eden during his previous term as Foreign Secretary. Chinese sources unanimously believe that Kerr has made the greatest efforts to promote Sino-British relations. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Eden Encourages; Army Soldiers</h3>
<p>London: When War Secretary Eden left the War Office yesterday morning to take up his new position as Foreign Secretary, he wrote to the Chief of the General Staff, General Dill, saying that the army would be responsible for deciding the overall situation when the final reckoning with Hitler comes. In his letter, Eden expressed his gratitude to the army officers and soldiers for their unwavering spirit and dedication to the country during this historically unprecedented emergency. Referring to the Egyptian campaign, he said that the brilliant victory of the British army in the Nile was the first reward for their courageous fighting, and that the quality of the British army in the Middle East, which is capable of winning victories, has now been demonstrated in Africa and will one day be demonstrated in Europe. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Halifax to the United States; Hull Expresses Pleasure</h3>
<p>Washington: Secretary of State Hull said yesterday that he was very pleased to work with the new British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Halifax. Halifax has made outstanding achievements, and the US government welcomes this mission to the United States. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Stockholm: According to news from London, the new British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Halifax, will go to Lisbon on Christmas Day and take a clipper to the United States, hoping to take office in the New Year. (24th Huitong Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Eden is Skilled in Diplomacy; Feared by Germany</h3>
<p>Berlin: German newspapers have launched a fierce attack on Britain's reinstatement of Eden as Foreign Secretary. The "Posener Tageblatt" said that the person who is now taking office as British Foreign Secretary is governed by psychological aversion throughout his activities. London hopes that this person's appointment as Foreign Secretary will improve Anglo-Soviet relations and strengthen its attitude towards Japan, Spain, and other Axis powers. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan's 76th Session; Parliament Opens; Restricting Party Participation; Depriving Freedom of Speech</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The 76th session of the Imperial Parliament opened today amid restrictions on political parties. People are generally afraid that the Parliament will close the doors of freedom of speech under the banner of a "new national structure" from now on. Most of the first item in the Parliament is about organizational aspects. Only a simple ceremony was held today, and the date of the formal meeting is to be determined on Thursday. The Emperor will also attend in person. Today's meeting is the first under the slogan of the "New Order," and no political parties participated in the meeting. (24th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Denies Military Supplies; Transported to China Via Vladivostok</h3>
<p>Moscow: According to a New York Times Shanghai correspondent, "The Chinese army has obtained a large number of weapons, medicines, and other supplies transported from Vladivostok, and American officer Carlson will soon go to Vladivostok to speed up the delivery of war supplies to China." TASS has recently been officially authorized to deny the report and solemnly declare that the report is completely fabricated from beginning to end. (23rd TASS Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Nomura Admits Japan and the United States; A Dangerous Storm</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The new Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Kichisaburo Nomura, told reporters that he was sent to the United States twenty years ago, and that the great changes that have taken place in the United States since then were beyond his expectations. Changes are happening everywhere. In short, the world is now undergoing amazing changes, and these changes will add a new page to human history. These changes are inevitable, and all countries must adapt to this new environment. Japanese-American relations will also be adjusted according to this changing era. The recent deterioration of relations between Japan and the United States is undeniable. Although there have often been small waves in the long-term exchanges between the two countries, there has never been a situation like the current one. According to my experience as a sailor, ships often encounter bad weather during navigation. At this time, the captain must be calm, organized, and close the hatch openings. What is especially important is to safely weather the storm. What Japan and the United States need in this critical period is the character of a skilled navigator. Today is not a time for anger, nor is it a time for nitpicking and exchanging harsh words. Mutual recrimination will not help us weather this storm. What is needed today is a calm attitude, a calm mind, and a willingness to deal with the real environment in a practical manner. If Japan and the United States can take into account the above points, I believe that future disputes between the two countries will naturally not occur. (24th International News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>American侨民 in Tianjin; Refute Matsuoka's Speech</h3>
<p>Tianjin: The American Chamber of Commerce here has issued an official statement on the recent speech by Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka, refuting Matsuoka's claims that Japan supports peace and order and has not closed doors to anyone anywhere. It also recounted the difficulties encountered by American merchants in Manchuria and North China in recent years, hoping that Japan would pay attention to American public opinion and make improvements.

<h3>Australian Envoy to Japan; Presents Credentials</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Sir Latham, the first Australian Minister to Japan, saw the Japanese Emperor this morning and presented his credentials. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese and Dutch Establish; Exchange Agreement; Aizawa Arrives in Surabaya</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Today, according to the Information Bureau, the Yokohama Specie Bank has signed an exchange agreement with the Java Bank, linking the Dutch guilder with the Japanese yen. Previously, the Dutch guilder was linked to the British pound and the US dollar, so the Japanese yen and the Dutch guilder could not be directly exchanged. After the signing of this agreement, it is said that the current exchange rate between the Japanese yen and the Dutch guilder will not change, but the agreement stipulates that the two parties should consult each other if there is a need to change the exchange rate. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese sources have recently stated that Kenkichi Aizawa, the chief representative sent by Japan to the Dutch East Indies, has arrived in Surabaya. Japanese Consul to Batavia Ishizawa, members of the Japanese delegation Ota, and Dutch East Indies officials all went to welcome him. (24th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Former Japanese Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal; Kurahira Yuasa Passes Away</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Former Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Kurahira Yuasa passed away today due to complications from a cold. He was 66 years old. (24th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Mrs. McCormick; Raises Funds to Help China</h3>
<p>New York: American philanthropist Mrs. McCormick raised US$22,500 last year as secretary of the National Child Welfare Army to relieve Chinese children. She has recently been appointed as the president of the "Chinese Children's Relief Association" and will work with the "China Relief Committee" to raise US$1 million to purchase medicines and surgical supplies to help China. (24th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Tense Situation in Vichy; Has Not Completely Passed; Germany's Actions Depend on Pétain's Attitude; The French Government is Intensifying Internal Unity</p>
<p>French Border: After Vichy leader General Pétain rejected Germany's two demands for Franco-German military cooperation and the reassignment of Laval as Foreign Secretary, France is now watching Hitler's next move with anxiety. Some are deeply concerned that the German army will take lightning action to occupy the previously unoccupied French territory. Those who are paying attention to the border between the occupied and unoccupied zones of France claim that everything has remained calm since the Vichy government responded to Hitler's final demands. The Swiss newspaper "Lausanne Gazette" received a dispatch from Vichy stating that although the danger has not passed, Vichy is now gradually becoming optimistic. The French reply was sent on Sunday by Perillaud, Vichy's representative in the occupied zone, to Abetz, the German special envoy in Paris. Although the truth of the German demands has not been confirmed, the tension that enveloped Vichy last week suddenly dissipated after the reply was sent. People generally believe that General Pétain will never accept any political compromise that would damage the honor of the French army and navy. Another Swiss newspaper's dispatch from Vichy said that today's bulletin on France's condition shows that the fever has now subsided, but the patient's condition is still not out of danger. Germany's next actions are still unknown, but Pétain's reply has indeed been praised. French Foreign Minister Flandin met with guests yesterday, giving an optimistic impression. Many people went to see the borders of the German-occupied zone to observe German movements, but so far, there have been no changes in the situation in any zone. It is said that Flandin told people that he was sure that Hitler was satisfied with Pétain's reply, because the reply had obviously made some concessions. Neutral observers are now asking whether General Pétain's order to the French army to fight against Germany because Germany has violated the armistice agreement is enough to stop the Nazi war machine. After all, Germany is eager to gain a foothold on the Mediterranean coast and seize the French submarine fleet. If it cannot achieve this goal through peaceful pressure, it will inevitably send troops to occupy it. General Pétain has made statements to the French people that French unity must be maintained, and he is now striving to put this into practice. In other words, Pétain is now taking the opportunity to strengthen the discipline of the unoccupied zone and the French colonies, such as General Huntziger's inspection of the French Armistice Army and the French Navy in Toulon and North Africa, and General Weygand, commander of the French forces in Africa, inspecting French colonies and key points in Syria. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Germany Uses War; To Threaten Vichy</p>
<p>A Swiss newspaper in Berne reported that Hitler had recently made threatening remarks, saying that if Vichy government Premier General Pétain continued to resist his demands for cooperation, he would cancel the armistice agreement between Germany and France and declare a new state of war between the two countries. If Hitler does this, he will occupy the unoccupied zone of France and control the ports of Marseille and Toulon on the Mediterranean coast. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Colonial Minister; Advises Unity</p>
<p>Vichy Colonial Minister Vice Admiral Platon recently issued a notice to the governors of the colonies, which stated: "All senior colonial officials should work diligently in the spirit of the New France, and not forget that any actions you take must be guided by a sense of duty. All compatriots must follow Premier Pétain and move together towards the path of revival. Legitimate freedom should be respected, but no one should stand aloof from this difficult revival effort, as this kind of undertaking cannot be completed without national cooperation. Our people have always had a tendency towards disorganization and complacency, which has plunged the motherland into a deep abyss. We must strive to eliminate this in the future. Governors in all colonies should especially have a spirit of strict discipline and respect for honor." (23rd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ambassador Leahy; Goes to France to Take Office</h3>
<p>New York: The new ambassador to France, Admiral Leahy, set sail today on the cruiser USS "Tuscaloosa" to Lisbon, Portugal, and then to France to take office. (23rd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Lyon: The French newspaper commented on the US government's appointment of Admiral Leahy as ambassador to France, saying that "Ambassador Leahy is a close friend of Premier Pétain and will bring a letter of introduction from President Roosevelt to Vichy. Our entire country will warmly welcome him." (23rd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Southern Ireland; State of Alert</h3>
<p>Dublin: Military authorities have placed obstacles on many roads in southern Ireland and have armed guards stationed there. Anyone who does not obey the order to stop will be killed. According to official notices, drivers of vehicles must be especially careful, because these obstacles are semi-permanent in nature and can be found at any time on corners or turns. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Former Romanian King in Spain; Being Detained</h3>
<p>London: Former Romanian Minister to the United Kingdom and current leader of the Iron Guard, Mr. Horia Sima, told Reuters reporters last night, "I (Sima self-identified) have good reason to believe that the life of the deposed Romanian King Carol is indeed in danger. He is being detained at the Andalusia Hotel in Seville under the orders of Spanish Foreign Minister Serrano Suñer, who is under pressure from Berlin. He cannot act or make any plans. What I want to clarify is that the Free Romania Movement does not intend to have any contact with the deposed King Carol, and I have no direct contact with the deposed King. However, the information I have received comes from reliable sources. The way Spain is treating individuals is extremely unfair, and I feel it is necessary to protest." (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Two Gifts of the Festive Season</h3>
<p>December 25th is truly a joyous day for all: it is the National Renaissance Day of great China, the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising, and also Christmas Day. Therefore, even in this world of continuous warfare, there is still significance in celebrating it heartily. Moreover, around this festive season, the old man of history has brought many gifts for the future of human civilization; among them, the two freshest are the formal announcement of the candidates for the Second Session of the National Political Council of China and the partial changes in the British ruling lineup. These are two independent events, but at this time, they symbolize two common meanings.</p>
<p>First, they symbolize greater unity. The candidates for the National Political Council of China symbolize the thorough unity of the Chinese nation, both domestically and abroad, across all regions, ethnic groups, parties, and factions. This is completely the same as the first session; the only difference is that the degree of unity symbolized by this session is even more widespread and close. The partial changes in the British ruling lineup symbolize the great unity between the United States and Britain, and among the various factions within Britain. Taking the appointment of the new Lord Halifax as the ambassador to the United States, Anthony Eden taking over as Foreign Secretary, and the rumored inclusion of Lloyd George in the cabinet to be responsible for domestic food and war material production as examples, Halifax is the current aristocratic Foreign Secretary of Britain. According to the traditional die-hard British mentality of despising the United States, this is indeed an unprecedented move to show special respect to the United States. On the American side, Halifax has always been classified as a typical Chamberlain figure, and his popularity in the United States is far less than that of Eden or Lloyd George. When Lothian's position was vacant, there were rumors that Eden would be transferred to be the ambassador to the United States. Not long ago, there were also rumors that Lloyd George would be sent to the United States, but neither materialized. Now, it is worth noting that the United States actually accepted and unanimously welcomed Halifax as ambassador to the United States, which is enough to show the complete trust of the United States in the overall national policy of the current British government. It is even more noteworthy that from now on, with Churchill, who represents the current national fortune of Britain in the eyes of the general American public, in power, and with the addition of Eden, Lloyd George, and others taking on important responsibilities, the cooperation between Britain and the United States will only become closer day by day. Furthermore, from the perspective of Britain domestically, it was already beyond everyone's expectations that Halifax was able to remain as Foreign Secretary after Chamberlain stepped down this spring. British public opinion and famous figures like H.G. Wells have repeatedly advocated that Halifax should immediately resign in order to fight Germany and Italy to the end. However, Churchill, his former political enemy, has been constantly defending him. One of the reasons why Eden resigned as Foreign Secretary in the spring of 1938 was precisely because of differences with Halifax's diplomatic views; and now, with one as Foreign Secretary and the other as Ambassador to the United States, it can be seen how closely they are working together. As for Lloyd George's inclusion in the cabinet, if it becomes a reality, then the Liberal Party, one of the three major political parties in Britain, will have another leader participating in shouldering the heavy responsibility of the wartime state. This will not only be Lloyd George's personal action, but also an important decision of the British Liberal Party. In such an atmosphere of cooperation and unity among British government officials and various political parties, the future British people and public opinion will inevitably become stronger.</p>
<p>Secondly, it symbolizes a thorough determination. Not long ago, Japan launched a large-scale "peace offensive," but it was immediately shattered by the firm expression of various Chinese authorities. In recent days, they have changed their tactics and launched a "rumor offensive." The announcement of the candidates for the Second Session of the National Political Council is ironclad evidence, enough to prove the complete groundlessness of the various bizarre reports recently published by Japanese newspapers. Regarding China's thorough determination, both friends and foes should now have no room for ambiguity, misinterpretation, or delusion. As for this reshuffle of British government personnel, it is a declaration of determination to fight Germany and Italy to the end, as well as a declaration to all anti-aggression countries and their allies, to adhere to their repeated vows and fight until the freedom of all European countries conquered by violence is restored. Since Eden resigned in February 1938, it has been the period when various countries on the European continent have successively lost their freedom and independence. Although they were conquered in different ways: the Spanish Republican government was strangled to death by the so-called "non-intervention policy," which was the price paid by Britain and France at the time for negotiating with Germany and Italy, and given to Mussolini and Hitler; Austria was occupied by Germany in one fell swoop with internal and external coordination under the tacit consent of Britain; Czechoslovakia lost its independence and autonomy due to the "Munich Conference"; Albania was occupied by Italy due to Britain's tacit consent to Italy's freedom of development in southeastern Europe; the remaining countries, such as Poland, Norway, the Netherlands, and France, were all direct results of military force. But no matter what, they were all direct or indirect victims of Chamberlain's rejection of Eden and his insistence on implementing his own diplomatic line. Looking back further, from the time Eden served as Lord Privy Seal in 1934, to his transfer to Foreign Secretary in 1935, until his resignation in the spring of 1938; during this period, he repeatedly fought for various principles of the League of Nations against and restricting aggression; and his final resignation was precisely because his diplomatic views on Italy were completely contradictory to those of Chamberlain and Halifax, and he was subjected to significant pressure and coercion from Mussolini to replace him. Therefore, at that time in Britain, he was the biggest obstacle to Chamberlain's cabinet's attempt to adjust diplomatic relations with Italy; but after his resignation, he was loved by the entire British people and regarded as a martyr for Britain's major external humiliation, and he has always become a concrete symbol of Britain's League of Nations line and spirit. Mussolini should be the first to have a headache about Eden's return as Foreign Secretary. Under the leadership of Churchill, whom Germany considers its greatest enemy, plus Eden's diplomacy, whom Italy considers its biggest opponent, and if Lloyd George, who defeated Germany in the First World War, is added, then Germany and Italy should completely abandon any illusions of inducing Britain to negotiate "peace." As for the Eastern violent elements who have been repeatedly "condemned" and "unrecognized" by the League of Nations, it can of course be pointed out here the inevitable trend of their future relations with Britain.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Province Investigates and Reports Largest Grain Merchants, Performance of Each County Publicly Announced, Chiang Orders Severe Punishment for Negligent County Magistrates, Dismissal or Major Demerits Assigned Separately</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The government is currently rigorously cracking down on grain hoarding. In addition to yesterday's execution by firing squad of Yang Quanyu, who hoarded and speculated, a secret order has been issued to all counties in Sichuan Province to investigate and report the largest hoarding merchants within their borders. It is reported that Chairman Chiang, based on reports from the National Food Administration and the Sichuan Provincial Government, has separately rewarded and punished the county magistrates according to the merits of their investigations. The following is an excerpt of the order from Chairman Chiang to the National Food Administration and the Sichuan Provincial Government: "Regarding the case of the deadline for investigating and reporting the largest grain merchants in each county, reports have been successively submitted by the provincial government, the National Food Administration, and the county magistrates. After careful examination and evaluation of the reported number of households, the following are the handling methods approved: (1) For those who reported relatively well, Qijiang, Yongchuan, Ba County, Jiangjin, Hechuan, Jiang'an, Luxian, Xuyong, Fuling, Fengdu, Qu County, Guang'an, Linshui, Mianyang, Deyang, and other seventeen counties, in addition to the separate orders to commend the respective county magistrates, the provincial government should immediately record a major merit for each person to show encouragement. (2) Those who submitted non-compliant reports and performed the worst include Renshou, Neijiang, Nanchong, Xindu, Guan County, Ziyang, Weiyuan, Rongxian, Wushan, Pengshui, and other ten counties. The respective county magistrates, regarding (code unclear), work that should be centered on grain management, dared to be so perfunctory and negligent of orders, which is truly unforgivable. The provincial government should dismiss or record two major demerits for each county magistrate, taking into account their usual performance, to serve as a warning. In addition, after checking, it is hoped that the county magistrates of Chengdu, Zigong, Huayang, Xinjin, Zhaohua, Guanhan, Shuangliu, Bazhong, Hongya, Shehong, Zitong, Peng County, Pingshan, Mabian, Mingbian, Yunbo, Fushun, Zhongjiang, Tongnan, Suining, Santai, Guangyuan, Nanbu, Xichong, Lezhi, Xunzhi, Beichuan, Nanjiang, and other twenty-eight cities and counties, who have not reported in compliance with the order, should also be checked by the provincial government to see if they have reported to the government separately. If they have been reported, they should continue to be forwarded for approval; otherwise, they should also be investigated and dealt with according to the above, separately dismissing or recording demerits, and a deadline of ten days is given to supplement the report without delay. (3) Other counties have already been separately ordered by telegram. If there are any false reports, another deadline of half a month is given for self-correction and reporting; otherwise, if any false reports are found, they will be punished by military law. (4) All reported major households in each county should be handled by the county magistrates in accordance with the letter to the Sichuan provincial people, the instructions to the county magistrates, and the regulations of the National Food Administration, etc., to earnestly solicit donations and sales from major households and the people, and the end of January next year will be the date for comprehensive evaluation. At that time, those who have achieved truly outstanding results should select the most excellent individuals to be recorded and employed by the administrative commissioners, in order to show the intention of competition and encouragement." It is heard that after the investigation of grain merchants, there will be further control measures. Those who hoard grain or have surplus grain and do not sell should be warned. (24th telegram)</p>
<p>Yu Hoarding Merchants Feel Great Panic</p>
<p>Chongqing: Former Chengdu Mayor Yang Quanyu was sentenced to death by the military authorities for hoarding people's food and was executed by firing squad this morning at 8:00 a.m. in the main thoroughfare. The general public was full of praise. It is heard that several hardware and pigment merchants were arrested at the same time as Yang, also for the crime of hoarding and speculation, and are currently under interrogation. According to informed sources, the authorities will continue to severely punish hoarders, and pay particular attention to grain hoarders. According to the Ta Kung Pao, the authorities are cracking down on hoarding with lightning speed, and hoarding merchants are feeling panic. It is heard that a certain financier has already dumped a large quantity of cigarettes, and so-and-so also intends to dump hardware and electrical materials worth 20 million yuan. In addition, some hoarding merchants are fleeing to other counties and moving goods to the countryside, causing major commercial firms to become empty shops. However, the authorities will never let this go and are stepping up investigations. (23rd Havas telegram)</p>
<p>Government Improves Grain Production</p>
<p>Chongqing: Lu Zuofu, Director of the National Food Administration, recently stated that the food problem in the rear of China was greatly affected by the hoarding and speculation of unscrupulous merchants. Since the authorities executed the former Chengdu Mayor Yang Quanyu and punished many speculators, the trend of hoarding should be quickly curbed. The government is now actively improving grain production. For example, corn, which is a major food crop for farmers, will increase by 10 million dan in Sichuan Province next year. In addition, with high grain prices, farmers will inevitably expand their planting area and increase their harvest, so the food supply next year will be abundant and grain prices will inevitably fall. In addition, regarding the execution of Yang Quanyu, Chairman Chiang has recently issued a notice to all provinces, stating that it was handled in accordance with Article 7 of the Military Law, and all provinces should order their subordinate cities and county governments to be universally informed to serve as a warning.

<h3>Progress of Cooperative Business in Guilin is Quite Rapid</h3>

<h3>Chinese Army Achieves Attrition Warfare Goals, Small Clashes in Southern Shanxi, Chinese and Japanese Armies Confront Each Other in the Zhongtiao Mountains, All Important Passes Are in the Hands of the Chinese Army</h3>
<p>Luoyang: According to a military observer who spoke to the Central News Agency reporter, since the beginning of winter, there have been no large-scale battles in the southern Shanxi battlefield, which is related to the overall situation in North China, but small clashes have not been interrupted until now, occurring two to three times a day, fully achieving the goal of Chinese attrition warfare. In the recent situation in southern Shanxi, the Chinese and Japanese armies confront each other in the Zhongtiao Mountains, forming an interlocking line, which is absolutely beneficial to us. The person mentioned Lishan as (1) the important passes of the Zhongtiao Mountains are under the control of our army; (2) the towns at the foot of the Zhongtiao Mountains, from Ruicheng in the west to Yongji in the east, are defended by the Chinese army; (3) on the contrary, the Japanese are in a difficult situation and cannot make progress. If they concentrate their forces to take a chance, the result will inevitably be small gains and large losses. Therefore, recently, they have changed their offensive to a defensive stance, actively engaged in road construction, strengthened fortifications, and blockaded traffic, etc., obviously adopting a passive defense. Moreover, in the future war situation in southern Shanxi, the Japanese army will inevitably be reduced to a disadvantage. As long as the Chinese command authorities seize favorable opportunities at any time and all officers and soldiers give full play to the strong characteristics of past battles and take the offensive, the Zhongtiao Mountains will not only be regarded as a blind intestine by the Japanese, but also become the starting point for the recovery of North China.

<h3>"July 7th" Cotton Gin Successfully Tested</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The new-style cotton gin researched and designed by the Agricultural Products Promotion Committee has been successfully tested many times in one year and has been named the "July 7th Cotton Gin".

<h3>Ministry of Finance Prepares to Establish Anti-Smuggling Bureau</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to Huafang News, in order to unify anti-smuggling work, the Chinese government has specially established an Anti-Smuggling Bureau under the Ministry of Finance and appointed Dai Li as the director to preside over the matter. Preparations have now begun and it will be established soon. In the past, anti-smuggling work was handled separately by various customs offices and the Economic Committee of the War Zone and the Commodity Inspection Bureau, but due to the failure to unify powers, there has been a large amount of smuggling. The value of smuggled goods imported into the free zone each year reaches 400 million yuan. Once the Anti-Smuggling Bureau is established, it can concentrate power and intensify anti-Japanese economic confrontation. This work is very important in the Sino-Japanese economic war.

In addition, it stipulates that if one of the contracting countries is attacked by a second country, the other country shall not provide assistance to the third country.

<p>Hong Kong-Foshan Route Suspended</p>
<p>Guangzhou: Although the Japanese have revised the quarantine regulations, the Taikoo Steam Navigation Company's Foshan, the only British vessel traveling between Hong Kong and Guangzhou, has now suspended operations. It is reported that the Foshan incurred substantial losses during its voyages to Guangzhou in the days after the reopening of the Pearl River. This was partly due to the restriction on the number of passengers. It was then decided to suspend operations. Later, the Japanese increased the passenger limit from 100 to 300 (the Foshan usually carries 1,400 passengers each time). However, only one passenger is selected for quarantine upon arrival.

<h3>British Prime Minister Churchill Scathingly Denounces Mussolini for Ruining the Country; Violating the Pope's and the Nation's Aspirations for Peace; Turning British-Italian Friendship into Enmity, the Blame Lies with One Person</h3>
<p>London: British Prime Minister Churchill gave a broadcast to Italy last night, scathingly denouncing Mussolini for disregarding the wishes of the King, the Pope, and the Italian people, and for plunging the country into war. He said that the British army is now tearing apart the Italian African empire, and that this was already happening at the beginning of the war, and the outcome in the future is even more unpredictable. Before Italy entered the war, it did not consult with its own people, nor did it consult with the army. The blame for this situation lies with one person. Mussolini, having been in power for sixteen years, has ultimately plunged the country into a dangerous situation, tarnished the dignity of the Italian royal family, disregarded the Pope and the leader of Catholicism, and violated the Italian people's desire for peace. This foolish act of ruining the country can only be attributed to this one person. The only reason Mussolini can cite for Italy's entry into the war is the old dispute over the treaties and territorial demands of Italy after the World War. You, the Italian people, were originally our friends and brothers, and the Italian army, have you ever been consulted by Mussolini? The only person Mussolini consulted with was Hitler. Mussolini chose to join the war when the situation in France was tense and Italy's neighbors were under great pressure, taking advantage of the opportunity. What is the situation of Italy today? You should know that now only this one person has to bear the brunt of the entire British Empire's firepower. The victories of the British army in Africa and the Greek army in Albania are evidence of the difficulties encountered by the Italian dictator. Britain and Italy were originally friendly countries, but current circumstances have forced Britain to fight against its old ally, which is a matter of great regret. British-Italian friendship has been ancient and enduring. Even in the last war, we were still friends, but fifteen years after the war, we are no longer friends. Although British-Italian relations have changed since the war, we could still walk together on the path of peace, and our people could still cooperate. But now that the war has begun, we have no choice but to fight for final victory. (Reuters report, 24th)</p>

<p>Berlin: General Walther von Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, departed westward yesterday to celebrate Christmas with soldiers on the front lines. Today, von Brauchitsch will deliver an important speech between 5:45 PM and 6:00 PM. (Haitong report, 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin: A representative of Hitler's party broadcast a speech to the German people, saying that Christmas is the most solemn festival for the German people. This is the second Christmas since Germany entered the war. German soldiers have traveled far and wide, with their footprints covering Norway, France, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, and pre-war Poland. German officers are temporarily stationed in Romania on special missions. In addition, there are German soldiers and officers on warships and submarines in the Atlantic Ocean. Imagining their shared feelings in different places tonight, with bright lights and mutual celebrations, is truly a grand occasion. Hess also said that those who are completely forgotten after death are truly dead. The spirit of all the soldiers who died for the glory of Germany remains with us and can be said to be alive even after death. We are fighting in the west and cannot yet claim complete victory, but we firmly believe that after victory, it will benefit the peace of Europe and even the world. In just one year, the face of Europe has completely changed. In addition to changes in several countries, the power of Britain has been destroyed. Britain's sword in Europe (France) is now turned upside down and is no longer available for Britain's use. Conversely, the coast from Northern Europe to Spain is under German control. Moreover, the spoils captured in victory are piled up like mountains and can be used by the German army to defeat the enemy. Germany has regained countless naval and air bases, which can serve as stepping stones for attacking Britain. Its disadvantage to Britain is self-evident. In short, the German army has a firm belief in the leader and internationalism. Final victory will surely belong to us. (Haitong report, 24th)</p>

<h3>Citywide Celebrations for National Rejuvenation Day; Vigorously Promoting the Belief in Resisting Aggression and National Reconstruction; Actively Advancing the Thrift and Disaster Relief Movement</h3>
<p>Today is National Rejuvenation Day, coinciding with the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising. Shanghai's various sectors are enthusiastically celebrating. Schools and the banking sector are closed as usual. Foreign consulates, the Public Works Department, various organizations, and foreign businesses are also closed for two days due to Christmas. All sectors believe that after more than three years of arduous struggle in resisting aggression and building the nation's defense, the final decisive stage has arrived. They are sharpening their resolve, strengthening their faith,</p>
<p>Telegraphing Respect to the Leader</p>
<p>Various public organizations have decided to telegraph their respect to the supreme leader and the soldiers at the front today. They are also determined to continue promoting national savings and disaster relief movements for the sake of national reconstruction and to benefit those who suffer. The authorities of the two concessions, deeply concerned that unrest might occur during this important Chinese festival, with unscrupulous elements taking the opportunity to create trouble, have implemented a one-day alert today, dispatching more detectives to patrol the roads and inspect pedestrians and vehicles to maintain public safety.</p>
<p>Cultivating Integrity, Welcoming Light</p>
<p>Today marks the first anniversary of the establishment of the Lide Fellowship. Coinciding with National Rejuvenation Day, a public announcement to citizens has been issued, stating in essence: "We firmly believe that to achieve the freedom and independence of the Chinese nation, we must first restore our nation's inherent morality. Therefore, we have gathered like-minded people to organize the Lide Fellowship to engage in a movement to revive traditional virtues. Over the past year, we have been greatly encouraged by the care and support of all sectors. Today, as we commemorate the first anniversary of our establishment and celebrate National Rejuvenation Day, we offer a few words of encouragement to our beloved citizens to strive together."</p>
<p>Dedicate All Abilities, Contribute to the Nation</p>
<p>(1) "The rise and fall of the nation concerns every citizen." This is the clear instruction of our nation's sages. All our undertakings and the happiness of our descendants are related to the nation's safety. If the skin is gone, where can the hair attach? Today is no longer a time for self-interest. Everyone should contribute their best to the nation. No matter how the environment changes, we must not waver in our aspirations. We must concentrate our efforts to promote anything beneficial to the nation. We must do our best to destroy anything harmful. If every individual in the nation can embrace this resolve, national rejuvenation can be expected any day.</p>
<p>Honoring Loyalty, Upholding Righteousness</p>
<p>(2) "Honoring loyalty" is our nation's inherent virtue. Yue Fei, Wen Tianxiang, and others demonstrated their loyalty and patriotism by refusing to surrender. This was the core of their strength. The reason our nation has a history of thousands of years and has been able to revive after countless disasters is that it is based on this core idea. Now, morality is declining, and people betray righteousness for profit, which is heartbreaking. Therefore, to save the nation from crisis, we urgently need to revive traditional morality, honor loyalty, encourage each other among relatives and friends to preserve integrity, uphold the righteousness of the world, and plan for national rejuvenation.</p>
<p>Patriotic Leaflets Found Everywhere</p>
<p>Last night, in various locations throughout the city, such as the entrances of the Sun Sun Co., New World, Wing On Co., Sincere Co. on Nanjing Road, the Great World on Avenue Edward VII, and various movie theaters such as Grand Theatre, Nanking, Grand Shanghai, Cathay, New China, Shanghai, Central, and dance halls, young men and women distributed large quantities of five-colored leaflets. The contents included "Support Chairman Chiang," "Strive to Complete the Great Task of Resisting Aggression and National Reconstruction," and "Long Live Chinese National Rejuvenation." There were also various Western-language leaflets, mostly containing phrases like "Long Live China." People from all walks of life who picked them up eagerly read them, and their emotions were extremely excited.</p>
<h3>Two British Banks Entrusted to Maintain Foreign Exchange as Much as Possible; Market Rumors Proved Completely Baseless; Rejection of Various Banknotes Does Not Affect Shanghai</h3>
<p>The national government is determined to maintain legal currency and stabilize exchange rates. The legal foreign exchange rate will remain unchanged and will be managed by the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee. The Shanghai financial market, due to the upcoming opening of a certain bank, caused speculators to revive their old tricks and spread rumors to make profits. The black market in foreign exchange was rampant. The HSBC and Chartered Bank, entrusted by the Hong Kong Equalization Committee, supplied as much as possible to maintain the black market. As a result, the black market exchange rate rose yesterday.</p>
<p>Change in People's Minds</p>
<p>The rumors in the Shanghai foreign exchange black market were caused by the upcoming opening of a certain bank, claiming that the Ministry of Finance would revise the commercial exchange rate, and that the Shanghai HSBC Bank would stop listing black market foreign exchange. Regarding the transfer of foreign exchange transactions to Hong Kong, the Chinese government stopped maintaining the Shanghai black market, creating profits for speculators. However, all of the above are unfounded rumors. The revision of the commercial exchange rate has been denied by the Central Bank. The HSBC Bank continues to list as usual, and the Chinese government continues to maintain it, which has already been proven by facts. Therefore, after the opening of the market yesterday, due to the HSBC listing remaining unchanged, people's minds changed.</p>
<p>Combating Arbitrage</p>
<p>After the sudden volatility of the local black market finance the day before yesterday, the situation yesterday stabilized. According to the Pingming News Agency, yesterday, the authority of the well-informed financial community revealed that the tightening of foreign exchange is a necessary countermeasure to combat arbitrage. The banking community, both Chinese and foreign, now unanimously believes that the Chinese government will maintain the supply of foreign exchange to legitimate merchants in the future. The foreign exchange fund of the Equalization Fund Committee is, in fact, very sufficient, but whenever there is a large amount of arbitrage, it has to be tightened and combated.</p>
<p>Rejecting Various Banknotes</p>
<p>Regarding the strict implementation of the ban on unauthorized new banknotes, the Ministry of Finance has decided on concrete measures. In addition to issuing notices to chambers of commerce and trade associations in various regions, ordering them to unanimously refuse to accept and use them, it has also reached an agreement with friendly banks in Shanghai to refuse to accept them and not engage in related transactions. Therefore, if these banknotes are issued, they will not have a significant impact on Shanghai's entire finance. It is heard that the friendly banks, members of the Shanghai Foreign Bankers' Association, as well as Chinese banks and money shops, will refuse to accept these new banknotes and will not deal with the banks that issue them.</p>
<h3>American World Class New Ship to Sail to Shanghai on Schedule</h3>
<p>The American President Lines' newly built World Class new ship, the President Monroe, weighing 9,400 tons and carrying both cargo and passengers, is the sister ship of the President Jackson (which came to Shanghai on the 12th of this month). It is currently loading cargo in New York and is scheduled to leave New York on Saturday after a simple ceremony for its maiden voyage. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai on February 6. It is found that the President Company's original old ship, the President Monroe, has been sailing the Far East for 20 years. Recently, it arrived in New York and was renamed President Buchanan, to be kept for emergency use.</p>
<h3>Nine People Implicated in Japanese Police Officer Stabbing Case</h3>
<p>On the night of the 20th of this month, around 11 PM, a Japanese police officer named Miyazaki Satoshi was suddenly stabbed to death with a blade on Wenmiao Road in Nanshi. The brief situation has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the truth of the case was officially announced. It is said that the stabbed Japanese police officer, Miyazaki Satoshi, 31 years old, was a police officer of the Nanshi dispatch station of the Japanese Consulate Police Department. At 8:30 PM that day, he was dispatched to Nanshi to investigate a theft case. Unexpectedly, at the scene of the incident, three criminals suddenly attacked him from behind with sharp blades. Miyazaki Satoshi also turned around to fight, but was stabbed all over his body, with a total of 15 cuts. It is also said that nine suspects were arrested afterward.</p>
<h3>Civilians Refused Rice Purchases at Fixed Prices; Authorities Announce No Rice Shortage; Rice Evaluation Committee Sets Rice Prices Yesterday; Public Warehouse Rice Storage Proposal Approved Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, with rice prices soaring, Shanghai residents unexpectedly faced a serious difficulty today (the 24th), because several rice shops refused to sell rice unless the selling price exceeded the price limit set by the Rice Evaluation Committee. Those who tried to buy rice at the fixed price were uniformly told by the rice shops that they had no rice to sell. However, those who secretly paid a few yuan more per picul, exceeding the price limit, could still purchase large quantities of rice. This afternoon, the Shanghai Municipal Council specially convened rice merchants to a meeting to fully review this issue. Some believe that rice merchants may negotiate with parties to transport rice from areas outside the concessions to alleviate the situation. Observers say that there is plenty of rice in storage in the concessions, so there should be no rice shortage.</p>
<p>Setting Rice Prices</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Evaluation Committee, due to the continued illicit trading of rice and rising prices, held an emergency meeting at 10 AM yesterday at the Soy and Rice Merchants' Association on Avenue Edward VII. All members of the Evaluation Committee attended, with Chairman Chen Ziyi reporting on the rice market situation. They then evaluated the price per picul of rice not fixed on the 9th of this month: (1) Siamese Rice No. 1 at 89 yuan, (2) Annam Rice Luc at 78 yuan, (3) Saigon Mixed Broken No. 1 and 2 at 76 yuan, (4) High-Quality Tokyo Rice at 79 yuan, (5) Tokyo Brown Rice at 75 yuan. They also evaluated the price per bag as follows: (1) Saigon Rice No. 1 at 104.5 yuan, (2) Saigon Rice No. 2 at 98 yuan, (3) Small Milled Rice at 97 yuan, Saigon Mixed Broken Rice No. 1 and 2 at 91 yuan. The rice prices fixed on the 9th of this month remain the same: Saigon Rice No. 1 at 87 yuan, Saigon Rice No. 2 at 81.5 yuan, Siamese Rice No. 2 at 80 yuan, High-Quality Small Milled Rice at 86 yuan, Small Milled Rice at 79 yuan.</p>
<p>French Announcement</p>
<p>Yesterday, the French Concession authorities announced: "According to the Rice Committee of the Municipal Council, (1) the Governor-General of Indochina has issued regulations to maintain the effectiveness of the Saigon rice control, prohibiting the delivery of goods in place of rice when delivering ordered rice. Therefore, the tonnage of top-quality rice that was temporarily banned from export in December cannot be replaced by the same tonnage of No. 2 rice, but it can be delivered in February. (2) It is planned to ship at least 100,000 bags of Saigon rice to Shanghai in January to maintain the balance of rice storage in Shanghai. Based on the current amount of rice in storage in Shanghai and the amount of rice shipped from Saigon or other places before February 1, there is no need to worry about the food supply for Shanghai residents. Saigon will have new rice shipped out in February, so there is no fear of a shortage. The restriction on Saigon rice exports this time is entirely to prevent the exhaustion of old rice, so it is planned to lift this restriction in February. In short, there is no fear of a rice shortage in Shanghai."</p>
<p>Public Warehouse Meeting</p>
<p>The Public Works Department of the Shanghai International Settlement invited leaders of various industries to a meeting at the conference hall of the department yesterday (24th) afternoon to discuss the establishment of public warehouses. After discussion, (1) 200,000 bags of foreign rice will be purchased to establish a public warehouse. Those who pledged to purchase on the spot include Yu Qiaqing 30,000 bags, the rice and grain industry 60,000 bags, the banking industry 50,000 bags, the yarn industry 20,000 bags, the flour industry 10,000 bags, the coal industry 5,000 bags, the new medicine and pharmaceutical industry 2,500 bags, the cotton industry 2,000 bags, the cotton cloth industry 2,000 bags, the sugar industry 1,500 bags, the hardware industry 1,500 bags, the wool industry 1,000 bags, the construction industry 500 bags, and the timber industry 500 bags, totaling 186,500 bags. The remaining 13,500 bags will be allocated by the cigarette industry and department stores, and the deficit will still be purchased by Yu Qiaqing. (2) A public warehouse management committee will be established, with nine members responsible for the overall management. The candidates are Yu Qiaqing, Xu Jilong (representing the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce), Wang Yuqing (representing the flour industry), He Dekui, two representatives from the banking industry, two representatives from the rice industry, and one representative from the yarn industry. It was also decided that the two concession Public Works Departments will each send one representative to supervise the committee. The representatives of the banking industry, rice industry, and yarn industry will be appointed within three days and reported to the Public Works Department. As soon as the committee members are complete, the first meeting of the committee will be held immediately to discuss all matters. (3) The management of the above public warehouse will be centralized in one place. Sales accounts will be announced monthly, and profits and losses will be distributed to the public accounts. The current foreign accountant (Thomson &amp; Co), who audits the accounts of the Public Works Department, will be entrusted to audit the accounts every three months.</p>
<h3>Slowdown at Xinsheng and Xinyu Textile Factories; Shanghai West Textile Workers Also Make Demands; Labor Disputes Arise One After Another</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, yesterday (the 23rd), labor sources said that 3,000 workers at two textile factories in the city had a dispute with the factory owners. If it is not resolved immediately, all textile workers in Shanghai may express sympathy and strike. If so, all textile factories will be closed. The above two textile factories are the Xinsheng Textile Factory on Tokyo Road and the Xinyu Textile Factory on Suzhou Road. The workers made demands to the factory owners more than a month ago, but did not receive a response, so they slowed down work on Sunday night.</p>
<p>Leading Workers Arrested</p>
<p>The two factory owners, fearing that the workers would take drastic action after the slowdown, requested assistance from the Shanghai Municipal Police Department. The police dispatched armored vehicles and police cars to protect the factories and arrested ten workers who incited the strike. According to labor sources, those arrested were repeatedly questioned by the police and have not yet been released. People from the two textile factories said that the workers did not declare a strike, so a complete resolution is still possible.</p>
<p>Shanghai West Textile Factories Affected</p>
<p>At the same time, it is rumored that other textile factories (mostly in Shanghai West) are also showing signs of unrest. It is expected that more than 100,000 workers in various textile factories will demand increased wages and rice subsidies, threatening to strike. Yesterday, work at the Xinsheng and Xinyu factories was completely stopped. Labor sources said that work would not resume until the factory owners agreed to the workers' demands.</p>
<p>Knitting Technicians</p>
<p>In addition, approximately 1,000 knitting factory technicians in Shanghai have been on strike for several days. Their representatives continued negotiations with the employers yesterday. Well-informed sources said that a resolution is expected soon. It is heard that 20,000 workers in the knitting industry have expressed sympathy for the technicians' strike, so the factory owners are eager to resolve the dispute immediately.</p>
<p>Movers and Automobile Workers Demand</p>
<p>The daily-hired workers in Shanghai's sofa industry have made demands to their employers, but most have not been approved, so they were still on strike yesterday, and it is feared that it will not be easy to resolve. More than 1,000 workers at the Shanghai Moving Automobile Company made requests to the employers last week to increase wages and rice subsidies. The workers' representatives believe they do not need to strike because the employers are likely to comply with the workers' demands, with only slight modifications.</p>
<p>Textile Workers' Demands Strong</p>
<p>Also, according to the Shanghai Times, it was reported yesterday that 300,000 members of the West District Textile Workers' Union have recently made several demands for increased wages and improved treatment to the textile factory owners. It is the first time in many years that an organized workers' union has directly negotiated with employers to protect workers' interests. The union's demands were issued in the form of a "final notice," with strong wording, stating that if the demands are rejected, the union reserves the right to take action.</p>
<p>Various Other Parties Request Pay Raises</p>
<p>Three thousand barbers in the two concessions also demanded increased wages and improved treatment from their employers yesterday. A labor dispute occurred at the Fuzhan Flour Mill on Moganshan Road, and labor and management are still in consultation. Some of the workers who went on strike last week have now returned to work, while the remaining workers are still on strike, waiting for the factory to announce new wages. Also, postal employees submitted several demands to Director-General Chappellin last Saturday and Sunday. They continued to work as usual yesterday, awaiting a response from the Yunnan Postal Administration.</p>
<p>Inaccurate Report of Public Bus Revenue Increase</p>
<p>The British-owned China General Omnibus Company recently increased fares by 35% starting on the 17th of this month due to rising prices and increased expenses, in order to increase revenue. Afterward, there were rumors that the company's daily revenue could increase from 50,000 yuan to 67,500 yuan. It is learned from reliable sources that the so-called increase in revenue is purely speculative and unreliable.</p>
<p>Rotary Club Postpones Regular Meeting This Week</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rotary Club's regular meeting this week has been postponed to December 27 (Friday) at noon at the Cathay Hotel for a closed-door meeting to introduce new members. Mr. Hudspeth, a member who recently returned from Vietnam, will give a speech on "Impressions of Vietnam."

<h3>Christmas Eve</h3>
<p>— Wei Yajun</p>
<p>It's Christmas again. Although I've never sung hymns like "Our Lord Jesus," I won't miss the chance to join the festivities, especially since the air on the "isolated island" is so suffocating!</p>
<p>As soon as the numbers on the calendar hit December, the windows of department stores and candy stores are filled with the footprints of white-bearded, red-robed Santa Clauses. The cotton-lined backgrounds are so clean and pure, and the luxurious gifts in the "Lucky Bags" are so tempting. If your eyes have a moment to linger on them, you'll subconsciously start counting the days until Christmas, or even calculate the exact day of the week. You've already made up your mind—you'll set aside a certain percentage of this month's salary (maybe even the double pay and unexpected bonus!) to spend on this "festive season." You think this way, your friends think this way, and your relatives certainly think this way too.</p>
<p>This bleak season suddenly becomes lively and bright. Beautiful window displays cover up the squalor of the street children. The hurried footsteps ignore the "corpses lying on the road." And those cheerful emotions naturally fail to notice the countless faces of sorrow in this great city!</p>
<p>"Merry Christmas" and X'Mas Sales are in full swing, extending this "festive season" all the way to last night.</p>
<p>This evening feels like meeting a long-lost lover, and like finding a place to entrust my soul. In the movie theaters, giant films celebrating the holiday are showing. Laurel and Hardy make you laugh until you can't close your mouth, and "The Breeze Through the Half-Open Door" is such a tender and romantic love story! In the restaurants, fruit platters adorned with red and purple ribbons are paired with silver cutlery. The bubbles in the champagne reflect smiling faces, and the warm air in the heated rooms is just as pleasant as springtime, right? In the dance halls, elegant "ladies" are putting on a fashion exhibition just like you see in Hollywood movies. Jazz music and Hawaiian love songs spin wildly from the microphones, "Why not be merry?"</p>
<p>In short, there is no time, no world, and no loss of life here!</p>
<p>But dawn finally seeps through the lace-trimmed curtains, and it is the people who were neglected by this group of souls that send them home—</p>
<p>The days have progressed for another day, and the labor of these people is pushing the mechanisms of the entire city.</p>

<h3>Passenger Attempts Murder for Money in Grand Shanghai Hotel; Yang Le'an Stabbed Twice; Assailant Apprehended on the Spot</h3>
<p>At around 3:10 PM yesterday afternoon, an attempted murder for money occurred in room 605 of the Grand Shanghai Hotel near the Dongxin Bridge in the French Concession. Fortunately, the waiter heard the commotion and entered the room, apprehending the assailant on the spot and turning him over to the police for investigation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Door Shut Tight, Chatting Merrily</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 1:00 PM, two passengers arrived at the Grand Shanghai Hotel at 343 Dongxin Bridge. They were wearing dark coats and carrying bags. They were led to room 605 on the sixth floor, with a daily rate of 11 yuan. They paid 50 yuan in legal tender and registered under the name Yang Le'an from Suzhou, a 38-year-old businessman. After the waiter brought tea, they closed the door and chatted merrily. Around 3:00 PM, they called waiter number eight (Lu Chuanxian from Yangzhou, in his thirties) to buy two plates of Nanxiang dumplings.</p>
<p>Assailant Attempts Escape, Waiter Apprehends</p>
<p>When Lu returned with the dumplings, he heard cries for help coming from the room. He put down the dumplings and rushed inside. The door was slightly opened, and the assailant immediately fled. The waiter apprehended him on the spot and saw that Yang Le'an had been stabbed twice in the left corner of his forehead and face, with blood gushing out. The injuries were severe, and a sharp blade was abandoned on the floor. He immediately reported the incident to the relevant Mulan police station, which quickly dispatched Chinese and Western detectives. The assailant was taken to the police station, and the weapon was kept as evidence. It is reported that the assailant's name is Xu Ze, 21 years old, from Suzhou, wearing a blue cloth long gown. He arrived in Shanghai with the victim yesterday morning to purchase goods and planned to stay in Shanghai for a short time. He saw that the victim had a lot of legal tender and was tempted to kill him, take the money, and flee. He confessed to everything.</p>
<p>Eyeball Protruding, Possibly Becoming Disabled</p>
<p>When the reporter arrived to investigate, he saw that the copper bed in the room was leaning, and the mat had fallen to the ground, suggesting that the victim may have been lying on the bed when the assailant attacked, resulting in a violent struggle. The mattress and floor were covered in bloodstains, and three five-cent nickel coins were left on the glass table. It is reported that the injured victim was rushed to the Guangci Hospital by ambulance for treatment. His left eyeball has already protruded and may become disabled.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Over 240,000 Yuan Leather Clothing Concluded</h3>
<p>Zhou Pengling (22 years old this year), the grandson of the late salt industry tycoon Zhou Fuli, previously retained a lawyer to file a complaint with the civil court of the Special District Court, accusing his elder brother's widow, Zhou Mei, of requesting a judgment to return 23 boxes of leather clothing. If the original items cannot be returned, please order compensation of 240,000 yuan in national currency. The case has been heard in court several times, and the presiding judge personally conducted an inspection and hired experts to appraise the prices. The details have been reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday, another continued hearing was held. The court ordered a debate because the case was clear. The attorneys for the plaintiff, Shan Yuhua and Ling Changyan, and the attorneys for the defendant debated fiercely. The court debate was concluded, and the sentence is scheduled to be pronounced on the morning of the 28th of this month.</p>
<h3>Ticket Inspector Forbes' Left Leg Crushed</h3>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, a Westerner named Forbes, who works as a ticket inspector for the British-owned tram company, had his left leg crushed yesterday (the 23rd) at 2:15 PM. Forbes was working on a tram. When he got off the tram at the intersection of Gansu Road and Haining Road, it was raining and the road was slippery. Forbes lost his footing and fell to the ground. The tram was already slowly moving, causing Forbes' left leg to be run over and crushed by the wheel. The driver quickly braked, but it was too late. An ambulance was called to rush Forbes to the Hong'en Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Cruel Stepmother Expels Son; Sentence Scheduled for 28th</h3>
<p>According to the Shewen News Agency, Chen Jianbai from Zhenhai, who resides in room 7 of the Xinchang Customs Brokerage at 48 Jinjiang Street and works as a "clerk" in the "Unified Tax Bureau," remarried after his first wife died. His new wife is fierce and considers the children of his first wife as thorns in her eyes. She recently expelled his third son, Binquan (14 years old), and his twelfth-year-old fourth son from the house, causing the two children to wander the streets. Although Chen knew about it, he was too weak to argue. The two children fell ill on Robert Sheng Road yesterday. The public hospital at 88 Robert Sheng Road learned of this, felt pity for them, and took them in for treatment.</p>
<h3>Criminal Cases Suspended for Christmas</h3>
<p>Today and tomorrow are the Western Christmas holiday. The Municipal Council is closed for two days as usual, so the criminal cases sent by the police to the Special District Court will also be suspended for two days and will resume on the 27th.</p>
<h3>Scheme to Kidnap Wealthy Merchant Zheng Jiwei, Demand 100,000 Yuan Ransom; 26 Culprits Apprehended, Guns and Bullets Seized, Six Admit to Kidnapping Plot</h3>
<p>The Central Police Station, late on the 19th of last month, ordered detectives, along with personnel from the French Concession Police Affairs Office, to apprehend a total of 26 kidnapping suspects, including Jin Fu, Pan Tao Tao, and Cao Bosheng, all from Zhenhai, at hotels such as the Xin Shenghuo Hotel on Avenue Mutiny. They seized a pistol, 43 bullets, and two fake guns. The suspects were taken to the First Special District Court for detention. During the continued hearing yesterday morning, the police stated that six of the defendants—Jin Fu, Pan Tao Tao, Cao Bosheng, Lu Genrong, Ding Agen, and Qin Haixiang—had already confessed to planning the kidnapping of wealthy merchant Zheng Jiwei and demanding a ransom of 100,000 national currency. Therefore, they were initially charged with attempted kidnapping. The presiding judge was on leave due to personal matters and was replaced by Judge Zhong, who presided over the First Criminal Court and issued an order for a postponement of the trial.</p>
<p>Social Miscellany</p>
<p>Anhui natives Gao Wensheng and his wife, Gao Pengshi, rented a house at 155 Guizhou Road this spring, where they bought young girls and forced them into prostitution for profit. This was recently discovered by Hua Detective Zhang Ziqing of the Old Zha Police Station's Flower Donation Squad. On the 9th of this month, they raided the address and arrested Gao and his wife, along with accomplice Zhu Shuzhen, and rescued two girls in distress, Zhu Baolan and Gao Meimei. They were handed over to the First Special District Court for prosecution. The trial has already concluded, and Judge Zhong delivered the verdict yesterday morning. Gao Wensheng and Gao Pengshi were each sentenced to two years in prison for jointly intending to profit by luring innocent girls into forced prostitution. Zhu Shuzhen, as an accomplice, was sentenced to six months. The victims were sent to the Ji Liang Institute for care. Zhang Agen, a thief from Pudong, along with several fugitive accomplices, broke into the home of Gao Guangwen at 10, Lane 575, Taopeng Road, on the morning of the 5th of last month around 10 AM, and robbed them at gunpoint. He was apprehended by the Yulin Road Police Station and handed over to the First Special District Court.

<h3>Food: Imported Rice Limits Further Relaxed; However, Black Market Prices Already High, Results May Still Lead to Higher Surcharges; Over 30,000 Bags of Saigon Rice Arrive, Proving Embargo Inaccurate</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market was once again in a state of frenzy. Although restricted goods were not generally seen, unrestricted goods were exceptionally brisk. Due to today being the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising and the market being closed as usual, local shops and warehouses were all adding to their reserves as a precautionary measure, leading to a sudden surge in buying. This caused the price of imported rice to rise by another two or three yuan. However, the official price limit was not broken on the surface, although the practice of surcharges became more prevalent, rising from 500-600 yuan to 700-800 yuan per hundred bags. Various mixed rice types saw less trading due to speculators not paying much attention, but prices were raised by one or two yuan or three or four yuan. In particular, broken pointed rice was the most expensive, at 81 yuan. The original Yinghua Company bags were priced the same as Milu rice. Yesterday, the authorities supplemented the price limits, calculating the spot price for Saigon No. 1 at 104 yuan, No. 2 at 98 yuan, Xiaowen at 97 yuan, Milu rice at 78 yuan, and broken rice at 76 yuan. They also prevented brokers from entering the market in order to implement the ban. However, the spot price for Saigon No. 1 in original bags had already reached 110 yuan yesterday, broken rice was 81.5 yuan, and Milu rice was 83.5 yuan, far exceeding the price limits. In the future, buying and selling may require many more surcharges. Under the publicity of the Saigon embargo and price fixing being inaccurate, a new fact of refutation emerged yesterday. A new deal had been struck for 2,000 tons of Saigon No. 1. He Yi sold it, with shipment in the latter half of January, at a price of 102.6 yuan. Back-to-back transactions saw lively speculation, with 1,200-1,300 tons changing hands, and spot transactions reached 14,000-15,000 bags.</p>
<p>Imported rice continued to arrive yesterday. The French Company (SSGR GL AVARENNE) ship, directly from Saigon, transported over 30,000 bags, arriving in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and docking at the Shun Tai Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. Also, the Taikoo Company's Sichuan ship, loaded with 651 bags from Hong Kong, arrived in port yesterday morning, docking in Pudong and scheduled to move to the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession today for unloading.</p>
<p>Since the supply of thick and thin japonica rice and other domestic rice types has not been strong, and the sales market generally feels that purchasing imported rice is not easy, with daily prices being nearly the same, many have switched to promoting japonica rice, leading to a sudden surge in demand and a corresponding increase in sales prices of two yuan. Kunshan hulled white japonica is priced between 100 and 103 yuan, Qingjiao thin-husk rice is priced between 91 and 93 yuan, and original bags are at 98 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice suddenly tightened yesterday, as it usually has a small sales volume and a lower price than other goods. With the current environment of rejection towards imported rice, people have turned their attention to glutinous rice, leading to purchases from many sides and a sudden price surge of one or two yuan in the market. Yili white yuan is priced at 98 yuan, and Hong Kong white yuan is between 84.5 and 86.7 yuan, etc.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Continues to Rise - Imported Flour Has Become a Speculative Tool</h3>
<p>Flour prices continued to rise yesterday as hoarders searched and purchased with every effort, and importers raised prices regardless. Zhonglou and Huaniao brand Australian flour reached a new high of 22.8 yuan. Yezhu and Meili brands both broke the 23 yuan mark, a considerable increase. However, due to the Christmas holiday, hoarders released some stock, and the price of Huaniao brand loosened from 22.8 yuan to 22.45 yuan, ending up similar to the previous day's highest price. Total market transactions were over 20,000 bags, and the underlying market remained stable.</p>
<p>Wheat remained firm and brisk yesterday, with flour mills feeling a lack of raw materials and naturally buying eagerly. However, the supply is currently scarce, and there is no stock to buy. It is reported that the Hua Mill received over 200 bags of wheat from the suburbs at a price of 32.5 yuan, and the asking price has already exceeded 33 yuan, so the market remains firm.</p>
<h3>Finance: Rumors Proven Unfounded; Foreign Exchange Returns to Tranquility</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange situation saw no changes in HSBC's listed prices. The black market exchange rates for British and American currencies rebounded, and the market situation was somewhat calm. There were no more substantiated news reports, and speculators' fabrications came to an end. Speculators who profited in today's morning session had already sold, and other transactions were taking place. HSBC and other foreign banks provided ample supplies of shillings and US dollars. By noon, the market had already begun to break down. In the afternoon, the Bank of Japan began selling, causing a particularly strong situation. At one point, the US dollar dropped by half a yuan, but speculators were still buying cheaply, causing the market to close at the same level. The spot price for shillings was reported at 3 pence 4375, and the US dollar was 5 yuan 4375, up 0.03125 from the previous day's British increase, and the US dollar loosening by 0.09375. The next three days are holidays for Chinese and foreign banks, and the market will be closed as usual.</p>
<p>Foreign Banks Offer Large Amounts</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, London large transactions, both near-term and forward, rose by 0.0625. New York banks remained flat. London gold remained stable. The exchange rate between Shanghai and the British pound was unchanged, while the exchange rate between the US dollar and the British pound sought more, and the exchange rate with Shanghai fell by 0.26 yuan. There were no prices for French currency. Central listed exchange rates remained the same. Foreign banks opened the spot selling price in the morning, with British gold at 3 pence 375 and the US dollar at 5 yuan 375, tighter by 0.03125 compared to the previous night's close for British currency, while the US dollar tightened by 0.03125. After opening, the market became unstable again as speculators came to buy. It is estimated that American banks sold US dollars for the next month at 5 yuan 34375. At 9:30 AM, HSBC listed exchange rates remained unchanged, but thereafter, HSBC and McCallum supplied approximately 100,000 pounds of shillings, slightly loosening the potential situation. It is estimated that foreign banks entered spot shillings at 3 pence 40625, and the US dollar also saw a rebound. It is estimated that Huabi Bank absorbed US dollars for the next month at 5 yuan 40625. By noon, speculators entered the market to sell, and the market continued to tighten. It is estimated that speculators sold US dollars to HSBC for this month at 5 yuan 4 yuan 75. The afternoon closing saw little change, with the spot price for shillings at 3 yuan 4375 and the US dollar at 5 yuan 4375.</p>
<p>Japanese Banks Also Seeking Sales</p>
<p>After the afternoon session opened, Japanese banks sought to sell, loosening the situation further. It is estimated that Zhengjin offered US dollars for this month at 5 yuan, but many speculators took the opportunity to buy, causing the trend to stabilize. Traders bought US dollars for this month from foreign banks, also at 5 yuan. Subsequently, as speculators continued to need purchases, the trend returned to flat. It is estimated that foreign banks entered US dollars for the next month at 5 yuan 4375, and US dollars for this month at 5 yuan 46875. As a result, the evening closing saw spot and this month's British gold at 3 pence 4375 and the US dollar at 5 yuan 4375, with next month's British gold at 3 pence 40625 and the US dollar at 5 yuan 40625, up 0.03125 for British gold and down 0.09375 for the US dollar compared to the previous day's closing.</p>
<p>Tianjin Exchange Market Weakens</p>
<p>Tianjin, 24th (Tuesday) Telegram: The exchange market opened sluggishly today. London telegram weakened, 203125, for 3 pence 8125. New York telegram shrank by 34375, for 6 yuan 03125. Shanghai exchange rose by 5 jiao, for 89 yuan. "Cash" slightly rose by 2.5 jiao, for 80 yuan 5 jiao.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Falls</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 24th (Tuesday) Telegram: This morning, the market opened flat, remaining unchanged. British, American, and Japanese exchanges saw no ups or downs.

<h3>Profit-Taking Leads to Selling; Gold Prices Slightly Rebound; Once Fell to 6,440 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw a slight rebound in the black market after initially declining, with prices entering the 6,600 yuan mark, once even breaking the 6,500 yuan mark. While rumors have subsided somewhat, people are still uneasy. However, large holders, securities firms, gold shops, and a certain bank's Shanghai West bullish company have already started selling to take profits. From the morning opening at 6,600 yuan, the market was hit by selling, and prices continued to fall by 80 yuan. However, after the large increase, the residual effects are inevitable, and small money shops increased their purchases, briefly lifting the market to 6,680 yuan. However, as foreign exchange reports loosened, cash shops also began to sell, and the upward trend soon ended. Prices gradually fell, and in the afternoon, as the US dollar strengthened to 5.53125 yuan, remittance houses and banks sold off, intensifying the selling pressure and pushing prices down to a low of 6,440 yuan. Seeing the low prices, buyers became active, and another cash shop's increase lifted prices by 150 yuan, eventually reaching 6,570 yuan, a decrease of 45 yuan. Based on the closing price of the one-month forward US dollar at 5.40625 yuan, the price was 6,462 yuan, an increase of 100.08 yuan. Total trading volume for the day was 15,000 taels. Cash prices were initially the same as forward prices, but later dropped by 3-5 yuan. No trading opened for futures. The minimum listed price for jewelry gold was 660 yuan, later rising to 670 yuan, a decrease of 5 yuan. Customs gold and other items remained flat. Today is the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising, and Chinese and foreign banks are closed. Tomorrow is the foreign winter solstice, and foreign merchant banks will continue to be closed for another day. Therefore, both the gold market and the foreign exchange market will be closed for two days.</p>
<p>Black Market Falls by 45 Yuan</p>
<p>The morning started quietly. Gold shops offered 20 taels to banks at 6,600 yuan, 15 yuan lower than the previous day's closing. Soon, banks aggressively sold off, and Shanghai West bullish companies sold to realize profits, causing a drop of 80 yuan. Securities firms offered 20 taels to banks at 6,520 yuan. However, soon after, some positive rumors arose in the market, and money exchange businesses initiated a buying spree, unexpectedly lifting prices to the previous day's high. Money exchange businesses entered 20 taels to gold shops at 6,680 yuan. Later, hearing that foreign exchange loosened, cash shops came to the market to sell, and prices fell again. Banks offered 30 taels to securities firms at 6,530 yuan. At noon, retail investors searched for bargains, stopping the decline and rebounding. Banks entered 20 taels to securities firms at 6,585 yuan. At the close, banks offered 30 taels to gold shops at 6,560 yuan. After the afternoon session opened, selling was lurking due to the continued strength of the foreign exchange market, and sentiment was weak. Banks traded 20 taels, for 6,520 yuan. Later, with the help of bank purchases, prices briefly rose to 6,550 yuan, but as banks and certain firms exerted heavy selling pressure, support was limited, and prices were eventually pushed down to a low of 6,440 yuan. However, soon after, a major player in a gold shop strongly entered the market, causing a leap and rebounding to 6,590 yuan, eventually closing at 6,570 yuan, 45 yuan lower than the previous day. The selling price of the cash shop's own brand of gold was more than 10 yuan higher than the black market price, and the buying price was 30 yuan lower. The current standard gold price was 50-60 yuan lower than the listed gold price, but no trading opened.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Listed Down 5 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael in silver shops was unchanged in the morning. At 2 PM, it was 5 yuan lower, and at 3 PM, it was another 10 yuan lower, before rising again by 10 yuan at 4 PM. As a result, Datong Heng County was 670 yuan, and Xin Tong Heng was similar to the above price, with buying prices 30 yuan lower.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Soars</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for foreign exchange and bill transactions suddenly soared. The discount on every 1,000 yuan reached as high as 6.5 yuan, and the discount rate was 6 yuan, an increase of 4 yuan from the previous day. The interest rate for the Wire Industry Association was quoted down by one point, at 6 points in both the morning and afternoon sessions.</p>
<h3>US Currency Slightly Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the black market price fluctuate rapidly, eventually trending slightly weaker. The British Gold Pound and the English Pound each declined by one yuan. The price of the English Gold Note remained unchanged, and the market price remained flat. The price of the US Dollar Note retreated to 18.3 yuan, eventually rising to 18.6 yuan, a final decrease of 2.5 jiao compared to the previous day. Demand for Hong Kong Cai Xuyao remained strong, rising to 4.35 yuan in the evening market. Canadian and Philippine notes tended to weaken slightly. The Japanese Gold Note fell after initially increasing, finally falling by 5 li, with the evening market at 1.615 yuan. The supply and demand for Korean Notes was balanced, and the evening market remained at the original price of 1.33 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities: Bond Market Remains Listless</h3>
<p>The black market for government bonds opened weakly yesterday. Shengda, Hongda, and other bulls sold off, and after Xie Kang covered over 100,000 shorts, the market price remained unchanged. Subsequently, as Tongkang bought 400,000 and Shunchang bought 100,000 of the Ding kind, and Lianyi also slightly hedged, but a multitude of bulls in the surname Chang traded heavily, and Dingkang also sold off the Yi kind, the market price was slightly abnormal. As a result, the Bing kind was slightly better by 5 points due to short covering, while the rest declined slightly by one or two jiao. Ninety-six were called for a small jiao. In the current environment, the future is not easy to be optimistic about. Turnover for half the day was approximately 1.4-1.5 million yuan. (The afternoon was used for settling the day's transactions and the market was closed, as the 25th and 26th are Christmas holidays and there will be no market.) The list is shown on the left.</p>
<p>Stock transactions: 200 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity stock were traded at a price of 9.25 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, at the stock market of the Public Industry Association, prices trended downward as excessive bulls sold off. Foreign exchange fluctuated sharply, and stock prices rose and fell accordingly, but eventually weakened. This was probably also due to the approaching holidays. Rubber stocks fluctuated abnormally, rising and falling with the foreign exchange market. Trading volume for all stocks was significant throughout the day.</p>
<p>London, 23rd (Monday) Telegram: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debts and stocks of various Far East British companies were generally flat. Stock prices saw very little fluctuation. Oriental Bank shares rose by 2 shillings and 6 pence, priced at 10 pounds 17 shillings and 6 pence. Gulakling rubber shares fell by 8.5 pence, to 15 shillings and 3 pence. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Many Firms Release Large Amounts; Yarn Prices Slightly Decline</h3>
<p>The yarn and cloth market, which soared the previous day, returned to calm and retreated slightly. This was because the foreign exchange market shrank sharply and then strengthened slightly. As a result, bears became active again and sold off. At the same time, some firms gradually released large amounts, signaling a bearish outlook. Therefore, insiders are generally not bullish and are quick to sell when opportunities arise. As for "foreign customers," it is said that they sell slightly when prices are high and buy when prices are low. Both sides are pulling and tugging, with fewer sales and more purchases. It is conceivable that the contention between both sides is fierce. However, actual demand is more active than before, and the price of miscellaneous brands of yarn is also gradually increasing. Yesterday, 135 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Shuangma yarn opened in the morning due to the panic of the short side in the afternoon of the previous day, and the price was raised to cover shorts, reaching 1,412 yuan. Continuing the market atmosphere of the previous day, the price of 20-count Shuangma yarn was 1,400 yuan, rising directly to 1,409 yuan. As some profit-takers sold off, prices suddenly fell to within 1,400 yuan. Subsequently, hearing that foreign exchange had slightly risen, prices weakened again to 1,390 yuan. However, as soon as the low price appeared, covering shorts and purchases from various sides followed, rebounding to 1,407 yuan. However, some firms sold off Shuangma yarn, and because tomorrow is the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising and the market will be closed, floating profits were released, causing the market to turn and fall to 1,380 yuan. However, the bulls remained calm and did not move, rising to 1,390 yuan. The closing price was slightly lower, at 1,385 yuan. The total number of transactions for the day was 7,425 bales. The price of 20-count Shuangma yarn fell by 8 yuan. The amounts purchased by various firms are listed below: Firms: 7,200, Hong Kong: 265, Mainland: 10. Total: 7,425</p>
<p>The afternoon yarn market was bullish, with the initial price at 1,388-1,389 yuan. Subsequently, it weakened slightly, with the price at 1,379 yuan. Finally, due to the exchange's partners, the price was 1,382 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Merchants Unwilling to Sell Cheap</h3>
<p>Although spot cotton transactions are not developing, holders are very strong-minded. Because yarn and cloth prices rose, cotton prices failed to keep up, so they are unwilling to sell cheap, and asking prices are quite high, resulting in sluggish trading.</p>
<p>In other news, the price of imported cotton. The New York cotton market was quiet. The lack of momentum in stock prices and overseas merchants' sales resulted in a closing price that was three or four pounds lower than the previous day. India fell by two rupees yesterday, including forecasts.</p>
<p>The Shanghai imported cotton market has been quiet in recent days. All parties are not buying in large quantities due to the tightening of foreign exchange. Therefore, cotton prices have not soared. However, firms have consistently adhered to the principle of neither buying nor selling. Current cotton prices are suppressed too much, so the price of cotton will still be high in the future.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: New Purchases Cease; Cotton Cloth Selling Slightly Weak</h3>
<p>The market for factory-made cloth fluctuated yesterday, with ups and downs, eventually loosening slightly. This was because the yarn market rose sharply but then retreated slightly, sentiment was weak, and buyers were quite full. New buyers stopped buying due to high prices, and it is not easy to rise again without new stimulation. Sales of coarse cloth were flat, while fine twill cloth and fine cloth fell by 2.5 to 5 jiao per bolt. The price of bleached and dyed cloth saw little change. Transactions for various cloths on the street were over 400 pieces. Cantonese and Hong Kong firms bought over 100 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth and coarse and fine cloth. Zhejiang and Fujian firms bought over 100 pieces of coarse and fine cloth, bleached cloth, fu silk, etc. The North Road Yantai firms bought over 100 pieces of coarse cloth and colored cloth. Today, 505 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong and 11 pieces were shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, due to the rapid rise in recent days, and the fact that the market will be closed for the next two days due to holidays, general retail investors were realizing profits, and selling was strong, leading to a sharp retreat. The lowest price for Longtou fine cloth fell to 31.3-31.4 yuan. Later, hearing that the black market for standard gold was rising, bulls added to their positions and prices rose to 32.1-32.2 yuan. At the closing, there were few transactions of fine twill, and prices fell by 1-2 jiao. Serge was priced at 1.225 yuan, also down by 3 cents.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Oil Price Surge Unabated</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the miscellaneous grain market, including Shantou soybean cake, under the various abnormal conditions encouraging hoarding, the price surge continued unabated. However, with abundant soybean oil in the underlying market, the trend turned flat. There were significant transactions: 200 dan of factory oil were traded at 96 yuan, and 200 barrels of Dalian oil were traded at 117.5-118 yuan. Another 800 barrels were ordered for delivery in the first half of January at 117.5-118.5 yuan. Peanut oil was in short supply and prices were held high, with prices rising by 1-2 yuan. 200 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded at 97 yuan, and 150 pieces of old stock were traded at 94.5 yuan. 30 barrels of Qingdao oil were traded at 128 yuan, and 50 barrels of old stock were traded at 126 yuan. The actual sales of soybeans were strong for both sales and hoarding, and prices continued to rise by 1 yuan, with transactions including over 2,000 bags of Tianjin soybeans, over 400 bags of Fahua peel beans, over 400 bags of Qingdao soybeans, 700 bags of Guidou soybeans, and 200 bags of Tianjin green soybeans.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 400 bags of soybeans, 6,358 pieces of soybean cake, and 600 bags of raw kernels were shipped to Xiamen. Shipped to Hong Kong were 290 bags of soybeans and 9,620 pieces of soybean cake.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Matters: Cigarette Factories Suspend Issuance of "Zhan Dan"</h3>
<p>In recent days, cigarette market prices have been greatly affected by foreign exchange tightening and surging black market rates. Consequently, factories have stopped issuing "zhan dan" (IOUs) to dealers, causing widespread panic. Both industry insiders and outside speculators are rushing to buy up stock, leading to further price increases. Yesterday, Old Knife brand cigarettes traded at 1,020 yuan, Great Britain brand at 1,380 yuan, Pin Hai brand at 900 yuan, Five Flowers brand at 700 yuan, Fairy brand at 700 yuan, China-made Hua Cheng Company’s Golden Mouse brand at 920 yuan, and Little Beauty brand at 950 yuan. With strong buying interest from all sides, prices are expected to continue to rise.</p>

<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>Today is National Revival Day: Schools at All Levels Take a Holiday to Commemorate; Educational Organizations in This City Send Telegrams of Respect to Chairman Chiang; Intensifying the Implementation of National Education; Promoting the Conscience Donation Movement</h3>
<p>(Dahua News Agency) Today is National Revival Day. All public and private schools in this city are closed for one day. The significance of National Revival Day is explained, as well as the responsibilities that citizens should bear for the revival of the nation, to show commemoration and encourage self-improvement. It has been decided to intensify the implementation of national education and promote the conscience donation movement. Various prominent educational organizations also jointly telegraphed Chairman Chiang today to express their respect, vowing to work diligently in their respective positions under the leadership of the supreme leader. Regarding the opinions issued yesterday by the local authorities in this city on rescuing the livelihoods of teaching staff, unanimous support was also expressed. Schools at all levels have also specially compiled a musical teaching material called "Leader's Song" to guide students in singing in unison, thereby stimulating the enthusiasm for supporting the supreme leader.</p>
<p>Telegrams of Respect in Support of the Leader Various prominent educational organizations in this city, such as the Shanghai Educational Association, the Secondary School Friendship Association, the Secondary School Guidance Research Association, the Supplementary School Teachers' Association, the Art Education Research Association, the Primary Education Research Association, and the Compulsory Education Promotion Association, regard Chairman Chiang as the supreme leader for the revival of the nation and specially telegraphed their respects today (original text omitted).</p>
<p>The Federation of Middle School and University Students and the Vocational Youth Advancement Association in this city also telegraphed their respects to President Chiang today (original text omitted).</p>
<p>Unanimous Support for the Authorities' Proposals The aforementioned educational organizations also expressed unanimous support for the opinions issued yesterday by the local authorities in this city regarding the rescue of the livelihoods of teaching staff. In the future, schools must strive for financial transparency. Aside from rent, 70% of the funds will be allocated to teachers' salaries. The increase in tuition fees will not exceed 20% to 50%, based on past fee standards and actual economic conditions. Reduction and exemption measures will be separately established for poor students. It is hoped that the central government's relief efforts will be implemented as soon as possible to achieve the goal of the "Relief Movement for All." Social assistance is especially hoped to be promoted together.</p>
<p>Singing the Leader's Song in Unison In order to further stimulate students' enthusiasm for loving and supporting the supreme leader Chiang Kai-shek, schools at all levels have specially compiled a musical teaching material called "Leader's Song," which will be sung in unison from today onwards. The lyrics are as follows:</p>
<p>Great is China, generation after generation produces virtuous and capable individuals. Having experienced changes and chaos, they are all able to revive. Chiang Kai-shek, the savior of today, we follow him, forward, forward, revive, revive.</p>
<p>Statement by Pan Hongding, Executive Director of the Orphanage The Communications Agency Was Spoken to and Rectified</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received a letter from Mr. Pan Hongding, Executive Director of the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education and Care Home, stating: "To the esteemed editor, I have read the report in the Education News section of your newspaper on the 23rd of this month regarding the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education and Care Home beginning to reorganize its affairs. There is a news item about a conversation between Hongding and a reporter from the Datong News Agency, and the content is slightly inaccurate. It has been verified that on that day, Mr. Ru, a reporter from the Datong News Agency, visited Hongding at the Xian Shi Life Insurance Company. He casually asked questions in a personal capacity. At that time, he asked that the matters discussed regarding the Home be exempted from publication. Now, upon reading the disclosed news, there are inaccuracies. Therefore, I hereby make the following corrections: (1) The so-called strike by teachers at our Home, as reported in various newspapers recently, is not a fact. (2) Although not all facilities in the Home are perfect, they are definitely not as corrupt as reported. (3) Regarding the handover from the previous director, Li Ruzhang, it was only stated that some receipts were incomplete and there were some deficits, but no specific amounts were mentioned, nor was it stated that there were no books or records available for verification. It is believed that the reporter of the agency misheard. I hereby request that your newspaper publish this letter in the letter section to make corrections. Sincerely, Pan Hongding, Executive Director of the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education and Care Home, December 24, the 19th year of the Republic of China."</p>

The fairy tale drama "Anecdotes of Christmas" had a novel theme, a special way of performing, and a profound meaning. The "Shanghai Scenery" of the live report was vivid and lifelike. The final program was "Metropolitan Epidemic" by the society's drama group.</p>

<h3>Christmas</h3>
<p>— Shui Rong</p>
<p>"Damn it, what time is it, still sprawled out!" the old man cursed, kicking Xiao Hu, who was sleeping soundly on the ground, hard with his foot.</p>
<p>Woken up from a deep sleep, Xiao Hu felt a sharp pain in his thigh. He opened one eye halfway and met the old man's fiery gaze and sinister expression. "Last night..." he mumbled a few words through his nose. Immediately, he rubbed his eyes and scrambled to his feet, fastening his pants.</p>
<p>The winter sun shone palely on half of the street. Hei Zi, the skinny kid, stood timidly to the side, silent.</p>
<p>"Today is the foreign bodhisattva's birthday. Pick something good. I'll give you..." the old man said, his fiery eyes suddenly softening. But somehow, it looked even scarier than when he was angry.</p>
<p>Xiao Hu snorted and turned his head to call Hei Zi, "Let's go."</p>
<p>The two ran shoulder to shoulder past the church gate. The gate was tightly closed, as quiet as a grave.</p>
<p>"Hei Zi, didn't you hear anything last night? The foreign devils inside, men and women, were humming and hawing on the grass on our side all night long, until dawn. Damn it, they were even dancing! Holding hands, making a big circle, with some kind of tree in the circle, covered with red and green lights. Those foreign devils were dancing around the tree, singing, laughing... I watched through the cracks in the fence... it kept me up all night, and I even got a few smacks!"</p>
<p>Hei Zi shook his head. This kid was always trembling, even with his "older brother." Unlike Xiao Hu, who seemed like a different person as soon as he left the hateful old man, talking and laughing.</p>
<p>"It's for that foreign bodhisattva's birthday, I guess."</p>
<p>Turning right, the street became lively. All sorts of cars roared and sped by. People jostled, shouted, and argued. At a tram stop, a noble young couple held a chubby girl. "Baby, don't forget to ask your dad to buy you a foreign doll when we get to 'Children's World'." The woman winked at the man, and they smiled at each other!</p>
<p>Xiao Hu ignored them. He pulled Hei Zi into the crowd. "Hey, your grandpa's smiling at you!"</p>
<p>Hei Zi glanced at the white-bearded, red-suited old man in the shop window. Then his eyes fell on the sock-like bag on his back. That was what he never tired of looking at! The bag was filled with soft bread, and things wrapped in colorful foreign paper. Just looking at it made you swallow your saliva. Wasn't it because he hadn't had anything to eat all morning?</p>
<p>Turning left again, the street became narrower, littered with vegetable leaves and fruit peels. Gradually, stalls selling foreign potatoes, carrots, cabbage, and dried vegetables appeared on both sides of the street. A fishy smell drifted in the air with the cold wind. Cops waving wooden sticks were chasing female vegetable vendors without permits.</p>
<p>Xiao Hu whistled leisurely, his hands in his pockets. Hei Zi was dragged along beside him. The further they went, the louder the noise became, almost bursting their eardrums.</p>
<p>"Shhh!" Suddenly, Xiao Hu stopped, made a face at Hei Zi, and darted past the fruit stall at the entrance, running into the vegetable market. Hei Zi lagged behind, but soon ran in as well.</p>
<p>The market was crowded with people. There were also quite a few yellow-haired, blue-eyed foreign women, carrying wicker baskets, weighing foreign potatoes and such. Their feet felt like they were stepping in mud, all wet and sticky. Suddenly, a scale flew down from mid-air, followed by a burst of curses.</p>
<p>"Can't afford it, what are you buying! A 24-tael scale is the death of the poor!"</p>
<p>Hei Zi wandered around, eventually reaching a stall selling Zhoushan turkeys. A fat foreign woman was weighing a large turkey. He saw Xiao Hu standing behind her, winking at him.</p>
<p>The foreign woman was paying. Hei Zi nervously ran over and nudged her with his left elbow.</p>
<p>"What are you pushing for, you little shrimp!" the foreign woman wheezed in broken Chinese.</p>
<p>"Who's pushing? Did I push you?"</p>
<p>Xiao Hu thought, "That kid Hei Zi's voice is shaking too much!" But he was making a ruckus! He grabbed the chicken and ran.</p>
<p>"Catch! Catch!"</p>
<p>"Catch that kid, he's an accomplice!"</p>
<p>Xiao Hu seemed to faintly hear Hei Zi crying. His heart sank. He ran as hard as he could, and after a while, he finally breathed a sigh of relief: "Damn!"</p>
<p>"Hey! Take one and see! 'The poor shall come to me!' So says the Lord. The Lord bless you!"</p>
<p>Only then did Xiao Hu realize that he was not far from his "old nest." The church gate was wide open. A faint organ sound wafted out, accompanied by a somber chant: "Glory!..."</p>
<p>The old man stood by the fence, staring with a pair of terrible eyes. "What took you so long?"</p>
<p>"Hei Zi messed up!" He handed over the chicken.</p>
<p>"Forget him! That little devil is useless, he needs a taste. Here, good kid! Buy two fried pancakes to eat!" He patted Xiao Hu's shoulder, and carried the chicken away.</p>
<p>Xiao Hu took the two torn five-cent notes, watched the old man's back, and shook his fist a few times.</p>
<h3>Willow of Changtai</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>(7) Cold Spring Water in the Pond</p>
<p>Under Stone City, a crouching dragon and a crouching tiger, was filled with bloody wind and rain, and murderous war clouds. The Qing troops broke Yangzhou, and Lord Shi died for the country, the Ming army disintegrated, and the Yangtze River was full of banners and flags, all of which were Qing troops. Although there was a natural moat, it was difficult to stop them. It can be said that the royal spirit of Jinling was dimmed. The Hongguang Emperor had abandoned the city and fled to Wuhu, and the large and small officials fled and surrendered. Many refugees, supporting the old and carrying the young, scurried around. The Qinhuai River, which was once full of singing and dancing, was also covered with death. Jade people were no longer seen behind the beaded curtains, only ghosts could be seen. At this time, Qian Muzhai had already seized the opportunity to slip back to Yushan and said to Liu Rushi: "The country is unfortunately overthrown, and I only have one death to repay the country. What about you?" Liu Rushi said calmly: "I have long been prepared to die for the country, and I don't care about anything. Why should the Prime Minister panic?" Qian Muzhai sighed and sat back in his chair, as if he were paralyzed for half a body and couldn't stand up. Liu Rushi said: "The capital has fallen, and the defenders have fled everywhere. This is the most shameful thing. Only Lord Shi Kefa fought against the Hu captives and died in Yangzhou, leaving the righteousness of heaven and earth. We have no choice but to follow in the footsteps of Lord Shi and give up our lives for righteousness." Qian Muzhai nodded and said: "We can only do this. Let me have three days of drinking with Qing, and then follow the late emperor to the pile." Liu Rushi thought to herself that you could not die in Nanjing, but ran back home in a puff of smoke, which already had hindsight. After returning home, you could not say goodbye to your family and serve the country with loyalty. You still have to drink for three days before you die. Why are you acting so slowly? So I was a little dismissive. But because of the deep love between the couple in the past, maybe he was short of heroic spirit for me, and he was hard to let go of the love of his children for a while. The song of Chu Bawang under the siege also has the sentence of What about Yu Xi? Although he is not a double-eyed hero, it is difficult to die for the country resolutely, so he had to forgive him a little. Therefore, during these three days, Muzhai hid in the Hongdou Villa, drinking pure wine with Liu Rushi every night. When drunk, he sang a song. Qian's songs were mostly in the tone of what can I do, while Liu's songs were quite in the spirit of seeing death as going home. During the day, Liu Rushi helped Muzhai prepare for his funeral affairs, taught his children, and lived in seclusion. His mother took his parents to heart, so everyone in the family knew that the Shangshu was going to die for the country. But on the morning of the third day, the magistrate of this county suddenly came to visit Muzhai in person. Liu Rushi initially did not want to extend the meeting, but Muzhai told his servants to allow the meeting. He went to the study to talk with the magistrate for a long time before the magistrate said goodbye and left. Liu Rushi asked Muzhai, what did the magistrate come to discuss? Muzhai said: "He just came to ask me how to deal with it when the Qing soldiers come, so as not to cause local corruption." Liu Rushi said: "What did the Prime Minister say to him?" (20)</p>
<h3>Congratulations on Christmas</h3>

<h3>The Great Deed of Christmas</h3>
<p>— Jia Yu</p>
<p>Christmas is a joyous holiday, and exchanging gifts is a popular tradition. The Hollywood stars receive an unusually large number of gifts because, in addition to relatives and friends, there are gifts from their fans. Therefore, the number of gifts received by the stars ranges from hundreds to at least dozens. The total value is, of course, a large sum.</p>
<p>Christmas is coming again this year, but many people in East Asia and Western Europe have suffered from the ravages of war. Mr. P.G. Smith of New York, in view of this, first proposed in the newspaper that this year's Christmas gifts should be changed to cash, and the recipients should donate the proceeds to the International Red Cross to help these suffering people. Since Mr. Smith took the lead, many people have responded to this move. Among the stars, Wayne Newton, Coleen Townsend, Carol, and the American-Chinese photographer James Wong Howe have all expressed their support for this great act.</p>
<p>This is indeed a great deed, a great deed worth promoting!</p>
<h3>Shanghai Opera School Stages "Holding the Wheel Battle"</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>"The Great Battle of Yu Qilin Holding the Wheel," also known as "Song Jiang Relinquishes the Throne," is an old play that has been lost for a long time. In the past, the veteran opera actor Wang Fushou (known as Red Eyes Four, with extensive knowledge of the arts) had preserved this secret script. Later, Li Hongchun obtained it, but he never taught it to anyone. Therefore, the Fu Liancheng Society in Beiping, the Opera School, and other troupes have never performed it. Last year, Hongchun was employed by the Shi Xin Stage. The Shanghai Opera School took the opportunity of Li's visit to the school to ask for guidance on everything. In addition to teaching operas at the school from time to time, Li generously presented the secret script of "Holding the Wheel Battle" as a gift. Now, the Opera School has rehearsed it thoroughly and plans to perform it publicly at the day show on Wednesday, the 26th of this month. The singing, acting, and fighting are extremely complex. The Liangshan heroes all appear on stage together, so the play is also known as "All the Stars Gather in Righteousness." The important programs of the play are listed below:</p>
<p>Yi Jianchou Captures Wen Gong Alive. Offering Sacrifices to Chao Gai is Extremely Satisfying. All the Stars Gather in Zhongyi Hall. Taking Dongchang, Junyi Loses an Opportunity. Yu Qilin Holds the Wheel Battle. Zhang Qing, the Wise Shepherd of Liangshanpo. In the past, when others performed "Zengtou City," it usually ended with "Yi Jianchou" capturing Shi Wengong alive. "Holding the Wheel Battle" is the continuation of the story after "Yi Jianchou." Those who have seen "Zengtou City," "Daming Mansion," and "Heroic Righteousness" should not miss "Holding the Wheel Battle" because the beginning and end are connected, and the plot after capturing Shi is all performed in this play.</p>
<h3>Christmas and the Film Industry</h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>Two film stars in Hollywood have birthdays on Christmas Day, and you must be familiar with their names: Humphrey Bogart and Louis Mauritius.</p>
<p>The arrangement of programs for Christmas at the Grand Theater in this city seems to have become a routine. Every year, it is always a work starring Shirley Temple. Last year's "The Little Orphan Annie" and the year before last's "The Little Colonel", and this year's "Since You Went Away". But this film is her last before leaving the silver screen; therefore, next year's Christmas program at the Grand Theater will probably change.</p>
<p>Before the war, every year at Christmas, the large and small cinemas in London were open all night. This year, the government has issued a notice that they must close at 12 o'clock, otherwise they will be punished by the police.</p>
<p>Chen Yunshang, the current film star who is red-hot, originally lived in Hong Kong. Do fans still remember the date of her first visit to Shanghai? On Christmas Day of the Republic of China in 1938, at around 4 pm, the Russian Empress brought a proud child from the south, which was her! Zhang Shankun and his wife went to the pier to welcome her, and a banquet was held at her private residence that evening to cleanse her of dust.</p>
<p>Sylvia Sidney, who became famous all over the world with the film "Madame Butterfly", has been silent in the film industry for a long time. She plans to host a party at her private residence this Christmas to entertain colleagues in the film industry, and take this opportunity to express her intention to "make a comeback."</p>
<p>In the United States, many cinemas, on Christmas Day, in addition to providing wonderful movies for ladies and gentlemen to enjoy, viewers can sometimes get the opportunity to enjoy a rich meal, and they do not need to pay a higher price than usual. The situation in Shanghai is the opposite. On Sundays or public holidays, most cinemas raise their seat prices instead.</p>
<h3>Miss Mei Xia, Who Will Participate in the Performance of "Tears and Laughter Marriage"</h3>
<p>— Du Ao Photography</p>
<h3>After Finishing "Red Bloodbath", Xia Xia Will Go to Guangxi to Get Married</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>After leaving Xinhua, Xia Xia put almost all of her energy into drama. In the meantime, although she starred in a "Qinhuai Family" for Golden Star, she once said that she would choose carefully before making movies in the future, and she would never agree to act in boring movies. Her regular job is to act for the Shanghai Drama Arts Society. She said: Acting in some plays that she considers valuable is a kind of spiritual comfort for her. However, although she is temporarily out of the film industry, she seems to still have a little relationship with Xinhua, that is, part of her drama in "Xi Shi" has not been completed. Currently, Xia Xia is rehearsing "Red Bloodbath", which is a new work by Yu Ling and Wu Chentai, directed by Hong Mo, and is planned to be a big play staged on New Year's Day. According to sources close to Xia Xia, she may leave Shanghai and go to Guangxi after finishing "Red Bloodbath". What is the purpose of this trip? We don't know. However, we know that Xia Xia's fiancé, after returning from Europe, is working in Guangxi. Some people speculate that Xia Xia may be going to get married, but that can only be confirmed by Xia Xia herself.</p>
