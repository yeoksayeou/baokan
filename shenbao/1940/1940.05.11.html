<p>社評</p>
<h3>醫藥高貴之公衆保健</h3>
<p>自米糧燃料布疋之屬，無一不爲囤戶所居積，商家所操縱，於是物價奇昂，民生大蹙。彼食力之儔。幸而健飯，則竭其體魄之辛勞，不敷饑寒之消耗；不幸疾病相侵，則醫藥亦既隨百物而騰貴，幾非一般病家所得問津矣。蓋如西藥，多爲英美德法製品：溯自歐戰爆發以來，藥物亦成投機目標之一。深扃嚴閉，必待更善之價而沽者，有之；居爲奇貨，售價視當日滙市換算，驟漲三五成乃至倍者蓰者亦有之。中藥多來自內地，漲價亦各有其理由。嗚呼，生理病態與經濟病熊交相煎迫，病家疾苦可想像耶！</p>
<p>夫人不能無疾病：尤其在生活昂貴之候，營養不能如平時之充分，居住無牛時之寬舒；疾病易作，理也亦勢也。勢不能無疾病，而藥價又如是之貴；則爲保全生命，恢復工作生產能力計，雖貴惟有忍痛赴之。即以補藥而論：似乎有財力者可補，無財力者可不補；不補既無害其生命則視補藥爲奢侈的消費無不可。然如大病之後應投之補品，不與補，則病不易愈，健康不易復，甚而至於終身受累，則補藥分不盡爲奢侈矣。補藥姑不論，若一般治病所必需之藥品，與人之生死有最直接之關係，然以今日之藥價，配一方，購一藥，或十數金，甚或數十金，於是其問題乃爲要命與否，有錢與否？無錢則待死而已。誠以今日生活之難，再加以疾病之厄，醫藥所費，不論按工就食之輩，將藉一已所有之抵抗力量，以待病魔之目退。即中產之家，偶有病人，亦將繞室徬徨，莫知所措；請醫無費，求藥無門，兒女啼飢，室人飲泣，此情此景，在身處病榻者當之，其何以堪。謂不甘東手待斃，則惟有　受物質之壓迫，究其極，終於求生不得。若此慘象，求之一般社會，觸處皆是也。</p>
<p>醫藥之重要，正與菽麥米布同，菽麥米布所以養生，而醫藥所以保生，今吾人所期於藥業者無他奢望，只望能以人命爲重，母以居奇爲事，限制囤貨之供給，勿使藥物滯而不流，勿使藥價扶搖直上。又望公曾在正義立塲，領導同業，議價一遵常軌，愼母以一時的外滙暴變，遽增病家以負擔。尤其關於一般治療所必需之藥品，其性質不屬於滋補者，尤應共同維持其平價。若使藥物因受戰事影響，來源不暢，甚或中斷，則尤望醫師與藥業益自奮勉，及時研求，利用國藥之特長，採用固有之藥材，依據科學，參酌成方，亟製新藥，俾應亟需，此在事業上，固得以此補舶來品之不足；即在醫學藥學上，亦得多所貢獻於此大時代之中。原戰時之所謂總動員，科學家實佔極重要之地位；中國醫藥，一方面追隨歐美，誠有望塵莫及之感，一方面亦應虛心承認國醫國藥別有寳藏，乃他國文化所絕無僅有之遺產。是應如何適用科學方法，從事「發掘」，加以整理，是爲中國醫藥界所獨有之職責，而値此大時代，尤爲盡此職責之最好機會也。</p>
<p>至以目前而論，一般醫家，亦爲生活提高，而增加其診費，用勞力獲報酬。原無可加以非議。但念病家非必富厚，而期待醫藥之亟，則尤無分貧富。高貴之診費，非今日一般之病家所能負担，其理主爲明顯。至不得已而駐院治療者，所費更鉅，房間也，診察也，藥物也，甚主棉花紗布之屬，以及一切雜項開支，亦無一不取之病家，一病千金，幾成常事，幸而病愈，非典貸一空，即債臺高築，輒破中人之產矣。醫生本有刲股之心，亦惟能深悉病家之痛苦者爲醫生；誠得廣其惻隱悲憫之宏願，稍節其自奉之好，於國難當頭之今日，爲病家開方便之門，揆之人羣互助之義，不應如是歟？</p>
<p>保健小能但求諸醫藥界，求之醫藥界，則已在有病之候，無論醫藥若何廉宜，即已不能無所耗費。斯尤願一般社會致其心力，以保健於其無病之時。談保健，尙攝生；善攝生者，必多健康。此其要旨，端在防病於無病，一也：知病於病之未著，二也；治病於初病，三也。注意此三端，不但有神於其個人之生理病態與經濟病態，亦有裨於社會：各國社會夙有種種保健組織，其法其意，自有足多。組識不一其方式，要在結合共同之力量，解除共同之憂患，務經濟，務方便；務以經常輕微之負擔，應付意外浩大之疾苦而已。</p>
<p>此外尤望一般社會之注意公衆衛生。公衆衛生，應出於公衆之自助，而由公家主持之。公衆如不講公益，不重衛生，縱有良法，亦難期宏效。至於吾人所期諸公家者，則在公醫藥公治療之設備完全，辦理得宜，若醫師之遴選，護士之訓練，取費之務必顧及平民，態度之務必擯除輕忽倨倣，床位之增加，防疫治療範圍之擴大，皆關重要。要之，公家耗費固求實效，亦必使公衆之樂於相就，病家之甘願信任；母如官衙，母如牢獄，母粗暴類於刑釩。能若是，公家設施，必因市民之合作。事半而功倍焉。</p>

<p>根據以上事實、足見英法對於德國之攻擊　經迫於眉睫、而此項攻擊即係取道比何進攻魯爾、因此德國政府斷定荷比不但將容許英法之假道、抑且將以各種方法贊助協約國、德國此次旣爲生死存亡之鬥爭、決不能任英法實施其計劃而晏然袖視、故已發表命令、派遣德國軍隊開往比荷、以一切軍事力量、保障比荷兩國之中立、但申明德國軍隊決不以荷比人民爲敵、此次事變決非德國所希望、其責任完全山英法及容忍英法計劃之比荷政府負之、德國政府決不攻擊比荷兩王國及其殖民地之完整、比荷兩國政府如欲於最後關頭保全人民、則請不必抵抗、倘荷比兩國竟欲抵抗、則德國當以一切力量以粉碎之、但所不可避免之流血慘劇、即應由比荷政府單獨負責矣、一九四〇年五月九日於柏林、</p>

<h3>桂省成人敎育　年實施概況（七）</h3>
<p>（九）結語</p>
<p>成人敎育年的實施、是本省教育施政和戰時動員的一椿富有意義的工作、在檢閱實施經過之後、深願將遭遇的問題、收穫的成果及今後繼續敎育的方針、扼要指出以就正於邦人君子、（一）困難問題在成人敎育實施過程中、所遭遇的問題甚多、大部雖能隨時解決、但仍有若干問題、未能完全克服者、此項問題最主要的爲、</p>
<p>（一）師資問題在一年內要使二百餘萬應就學的成人普遍受敎、自然需要大量的師資、但合格的帥資殊感供不應求、雖然短期訓練的辦法、將師資數量解決大半、但以受訓敎師、素質參差、時間忽促、師資的質地、難以一律提高、</p>
<p>（二）學生問題成人班學生、有因生活奔走·職業流動·家事忙碌、致常發生缺課或無心向學的現象、或因戰時徵調民工、淸野疏散、對於定式成人敎育的實施、不無相當影響、</p>
<p>（三）敎材問題成人班敎材、關於部發課本數量不敷、課木內容亦未能完全適合、需要本省編印之戰時成人敎育課本、（民衆如何抗戰）亦因戰時交通關係、無不易依期分發、時事報吿一科、在邊遠縣份、因省府所發情報及遞送遲滯之故、對於材料搜集尤感困難、</p>
<p>（四）視導問題成人敎育年之省視導、雖然動員了省政府敎育廳之督學及視導專員等分任各區視導主任、每區並增成人敎育視導員一人至二人、但各區地域遼闊、交通不便、視導難以週到、至於各縣縣收府除動員第三科科員出發視導外、並准增設臨時科員若干人、担任視導工作、但縣以下各級工作人員、因戰時政務紛忙、每有不能集中精力於視導工作者、</p>
<p>（二）實際成果在成人敎育年實施過程中、雖然遭遇了很多的困難問題、但由於成人敎育工作人員及社會各方面的通力合作、事實上已收到相當偉大的成果、茲舉其犖犖大者數端、（子）造成濃厚敎育空氣自成人敎育年開幕、經全省公務員及智識份子、作一度熱烈的宣傳、並得社會各方面的熱心推動後、一般失學成人入學、不久即深感求知需要及讀書興越、多數學生結業時要求延長上課時間、不願繳還課本、寗願備款賠償書價、以便於農隙時從事溫習、優秀的學生甚且於結業考試時、故意繳交白卷、以博得繼續受敎的機會、可知成人敎育年、確已造成熱烈的敎育空氣、</p>
<p>（丑）普遍提高民族意誠提高民族實識、激發愛國熱情·原爲成人敎育年實施之重要中旨、而其收穫亦相當顯著、例如入學成人普遍的了解、日本軍閥爲中國之唯一的敵人、明白國民公約、軍民合作公約的眞義、每逢社會活動、成人班學生、多能作激昂慷慨的演說及活動、這可見民族意識提高的一斑、（實）發揮民衆動員力量失學成人受了兩個月敎育之薰陶、深明「有錢出錢、有力出力」的大義、並激於愛國熱情、對於戰時服務工作、特別的努力、例如賓陽縣第三期成人班、發動捐獻布鞋及軍帽運動、贈送前方將士、以布鞋一項計、即有一萬五千雙之譜、陸川縣某鄉成人班、捐募布鞋得一千六百雙、北流縣成人班、「九一八」舉行獻金、計得八百餘元、至各縣成人班捐獻財物及戰時服務的實續、不勝枚舉、</p>
<p>（卯）促進基層建設工作由於成人敎育的普及、一般民衆對政令更爲瞭解、而樂於奉行、此可於民衆之參加村街民大會者較前踴躍、一般不良風俗日見改良鄉村公共造產運動較前積極、窺見一斑、至於婦女勸導其兄長夫婿服務兵役者、亦屢見不鮮、　事實足證成人敎育年、對於促進基層建設的功力日漸彰著、</p>
<p>（辰）啟發文化落後縣份成人敎育年的實施、集中人力財力尤以過去邊遠縣份、每因客觀條件限制、文化落後、敎育徧枯、至此、則因辦理普遍敎育空氣、瀰漫全省、邊界縣份、風氣大開、並啟發了文化進步之機、（三）今後展望成人敎育年的實施、集中人力財力去推行、雖能達到普遍施敎的要求、但兩個月的敎學時閒殊嫌過短、今後自須在此基礎上致力於敎育的深化、因此機成人敎育年之後、特重訂二十九年成人敎育實施討劃、設置成人敎育機續班、使受完兩個月成人敎育的成人、有繼續受敎的機會、</p>

<h3>歐戰擴大　黃金漲風再起　收後抬至七一六〇元尙有求無供</h3>
<p>昨日本市現金烚赤暗市非常漲風、突復爆發、價已飛出七千元大關外、乃外電傳歐戰擴大、德軍又侵入荷·比、並傳比京業告陷落、預測今日美英滙兌勢將暴跌、美滙劇緊、致將甫告轉疲之人心、為之激易、晨開雖堅尙穩為六千八白六十元、嗣見六千八百五十五元低價、旋聞外匯於港電及洋行扒結下趨緊、金號銀號傾進、展開漲風、飛出六千九百元外、升至六千九百五十五元、近午隨匯市下落、一度銳跌九十五元、距至午後、外電傳來、美匯驟緊、且證券帮猛進、跟風者雲集、故在有求無供局勢下、漲風益烈、竟直漲至收市七千〇九十元為最高價、回漲二百十一元、收後　美金票奇昂、烚赤跟之上漲、塲外續見飛升、至晚六點半升至七千一百六十元有求無供、全日交易四千餘兩、飾金亦飛上二十元、達七百二十元、關金等平均</p>
<p>烚赤漲二百十一元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開人心平疲、略撳十九元、金號出銀號二十兩、為六千八百六十元、嗣有金號及銀號帮扒吸、立回漲二十元、銀號出銀樓帮五十兩、為六千八百八十元、旋乃錢兌業忽來吐塞、重告向下、錢兌業出金號三十兩、為六千八百五十五元、幸其時銀號帮重來搜購、復又回升、後再以外匯突然報緊、買風漸形擴大、金號及銀號競扒、立衝出六千九百元大關、銀號對做十兩、昂為六千九百五十五元、不意此後匯市忽報回硬、散戶頓乘高吐出、價遂逐漸步下、退至六千九百元時、賣者更多、銀號帮多頭復出、再降四十元、金號出銀號十兩、為六千八百六十元、將近收盤、時賣風稍戢、銀號帮見賤重撈、回升　十元、銀號進錢兌業二十兩、為六千八百八十元作午收價、午後人心頗佳、售者乏人、一開即高三十元、金號出銀號三十兩、為六千九百十元、後以銀號帮沽出拋空、回撳三十元、錢兌業出金號十兩、為六千八百八十元、旋乃電傳歐洲消息利多、金號猛抬散戶亦跟風吸收、且滙市忽報軟化、一時賣者極少、立哄起二百〇五元、銀號對做二十兩、為七千〇八十五元、斯時某金號獲利多頭當出、立回小五十五元、金號出證券帮二十兩、為七千〇三十元、入後卒因拋空者見勢急於抵補、銀號搜入尤多、重又飛漲六十元、銀號進金號二十兩為七千〇九十元作晚收價、結果比上日狂漲二百十一元、全天二百三十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十元、收進减低二十餘元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元光景、</p>
<p>銀樓飾金掛大念元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍厯七百元、迨至二時四十五分掛大十元、三時〇五分又高十元、結果共大二十元、計大　行改厯七百二十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低三十元之　、</p>
<h3>外幣傍晚疾升</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、英美金鎊晨問尙穩、午後突以德軍侵攻　比、金價急　趨漲、故買氣陡盛、結果比上日各漲五元、英金票晨漲午後回平、美金票上午盤旋略堅、午後黑市美滙大縮、晚市高至二十一元五角半、比上日猛漲一元、香港票稍有需要、市價略漲、法郎票及新·荷·安南·羅比·坎·菲列濱票等需要均殷、市價一致　漲、日金票及朝鮮票供求均勻、市價站穩、前者為一元二角八分、後者為一元、</p>
<h3>貼現拆息尙平</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、由跌回平、每千元上午初由一百十八元做低至一百〇五元、正午一百十元左右、下午曾升至一百二十五元、最後一百二十元、與上日價彷彿、錢業公會拆息、晨午兩市均仍掛二角五分云、</p>
<h3>證券　外股動搖</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况初堅後疲、市上買戶頓稀、情勢又見供過於求狀况、終以缺乏對手、成交極少、市况除丙種外、餘則頗形岑寂、丁種舉行第九次抽籤、因除中籤備利、故獨小元許之多、蓋以其他各種均已回鬆、為之帶小尤多、收盤後、德荷業已開火、張伯輪下野種種消息暗中市價尤低、前途又難樂觀、上午聯益鴻大樂茂義泰開價買進、初價比隔日獨强一二角、後以同順鴻康大批賣出、價乃逐步下退、午後賣戶雖多、買戶極少、乃互相擯持、市　祇五分參差而已、結果除丁種因抽籤關係小九角為獨多外、餘祇小一角左右、戊種尙好一角、成交總數共計不過五十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>類別　最高　最低　收盤　比前日</p>
<p>統甲五九·五　——　五九·二五跌〇·〇五</p>
<p>統乙五〇·八五　五〇·七　五〇·七　又〇·一五</p>
<p>統內四八·八五　四八·五五四八·六〇又〇·一〇</p>
<p>統丁四七·六〇　——　四七·六〇又〇·九〇</p>
<p>統戊四九·六〇　四九·四〇　　·四五漲〇·一〇</p>
<p>股票交易、成交冠生　食品公司股五十股、　為四十元正、</p>
<p>衆業股市關盤、趨勢尙穩、移時週末了結者、競來出籠、價格下游、一如往例、週初交易最盛之股、此時下跌亦最劇、英聯股自七十元落至六十七元五角買進、六十八元五角賣出收盤、或交三萬五千七百股、國際股自卅八元半至三十七元二五、收盤三十七元買進、揚　股站穩於二十一元價、以至收市不變、中國緊植股、以三十元二五買進開盤、一度低至二十八元二五、收市回堅、價為二十八元半買進、二十九元賣出、</p>
<p>橡皮股續略趨軟、較前日收盤、所跌甚屬有限、且有部份回高者、如蘭格志股收盤較前反高元餘、設在經常情飛下、下星期一市况、敢說必趨好面但午後消息傳來、德軍侵攻荷蘭、故對於未來市况、甚難作一預測、或者略有影響、或者全無影響、徒引起交易者之態度猶豫亦未可知、</p>
<p>倫勢九日（週四）電、今日中外債掛牌行市仍告平定、上下檔各債券槪無變動、</p>
<p>倫敦九日（週四）電、今日英商遠東各公司股票掛牌行市大致仍告平穩、僅古拉客林傍橡皮股回跌四便士半、為十八先令　便士半、其餘不動、</p>
<h3>撤馬格派股息</h3>
<p>英商匯通洋行經　之撤馬格橡皮有限公司昨經董事會議決、定於五月二十四日分派截至一九四年九月底止一年度之中期股息、每股國幣一角元分、本年度中期股　因受馬來亞政府統制外匯限制、祗派一次、</p>
<h3>紗花　在買空賣空之下　棉紗價格　相差絕大</h3>
<p>紗市現起　落、自大漲之後、已起反動而下挫、但市塲淸形、異常紊亂不一、同等二十支棉紗價格、高低程度要相差一百元至一百五十元、此種狀况、全係實際交易缺乏、及銀根緊迫所致、惟投機目標產二十支紗價奇高、　空賣空之故也、</p>
<p>現紗晨關因人心不振、及浮多吐出、二十支雙馬跌三十元、為一千五百七十元、旋聞廠載英國內關將有改組之說、外匯改縮、現金趨漲、買戶又復紛紛活動、回漲至一千六百十五元、查半日間成交統計一千五百六十包、行情一十支變馬漲八元、今日有棉紗、一千三百三十五件、運往香港、又一百二十五件運往廣州灣、又二十五件、運往海口、又五十件、運往海防、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>喬港三八〇　同行一、二〇</p>
<p>寗波　一〇　統計一、　六〇</p>
<p>午後聞德軍突攻荷　、黃金　騰、投機者紛紛活動、紗布交易所中進出熱鬧非凡、二十支某紗價格忽然漲起三十餘元、</p>
<h3>印棉現貨　成交獨旺</h3>
<p>本棉成交殊鮮、惟印棉交易異常發展、而印棉電訊、因歐洲戰雲瀰　、市價下降、人心稍受牽制、茲將現棉成交情形列左、</p>
<p>三六〇·〇〇</p>
<p>米特林　三四二·〇〇　同行進　〇〇件</p>
<p>三三五·〇〇</p>
<p>彭家浦　三〇五·〇〇　又　三〇〇件</p>
<p>下沙打包二八六·〇〇　又　四四〇件</p>
<p>中印度　二　〇·〇〇　又　一〇〇件</p>
<p>興亨　二八八·〇〇　又　二〇〇件</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初即形堅定、後因投機者之購買、及華爾街之購買、市况益趨良好、後因空頭之抵補、結果連跌多日之棉市、昨日漲起八九磅音、印度棉市終因歐局日趨惡劣、故昨日連同預測跌三羅比、埃及漲八九磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、因消息傳來、德國進犯荷蘭、匯兌轉緊、各同業以歐洲戰事之擴大、外棉之運輸來華、困難增加、且日來天津帮　形採購、市上現貨日减、故現貨之售價異常俏俐、一般觀測、現貨恐將騰貴也、茲將昨日棉市以美匯四元七五、折合送廠價如下、</p>
<p>二十支　美米特林　三六四·五〇</p>
<p>二十支　又　下級三二一·一〇</p>
<p>三十二支　又　三八九·七〇</p>
<p>三十二支　又　下級三七四·五〇</p>
<p>四十二支　又　三　二·　〇</p>
<p>四十二支　又　下級三八〇·一〇</p>
<h3>疋頭　東貨囤購復活　漲勢重厲</h3>
<p>國布　昨市晨疲午堅、蓋以實銷　頓、手貨傾吐、低盤迭現、惟旋以黃金突漲、市塲傳德荷局勢危急等利多消息、人心激　、市盤又步步回昂、結果與上日相彷、甬溫帮以匯水暴落、各貨添辦稍增、成交細布·漂布·色布·粗布·等一百餘件、粵帮辦色布·府綢·印花貨二百數十件、本街染廠辦坯布一萬餘疋、府綢色布　五六千疋、國外新加坡等地辦色布色斜漂布五千餘疋、</p>
<p>東布　昨以　金回升、一般看高心思者、重起購囤、漲勢復盛、十二磅龍頭細布較前日市盤每疋又漲三元五角、龍頭現棧單最高價到五十三元八角、收市為五十三元三角、四君子嗶嘰收盤每碼一元五角二分半、本月份一元五角七分、本街實銷仍淸、惟北帮心思看好、收羅現期貨各牌細布六七百件、</p>
<p>出口　今（十一日）有棉布四百八十七件、運往香港、又二百五十件運廣州灣、又二十九件運海門、又九百八十二件運海防、又五十件運烟台、又三百八十件運天津、</p>
<h3>白帆布需要增旺</h3>
<p>昨呢絨行情仍昂漲、白帆布昨日市銷、頗形暢達、因大熱大小幫號衣客衣齊起、裁縫幫需要大增、國產三星闊幅白帆布、現交每碼批沽二元六角、狹幅雜牌為一元九角、非西貨老刀牌二元八角半、</p>
<h3>糧食　糯米忽漲</h3>
<p>又是囤戶作祟洋米十後亦漲</p>
<p>米市自連朝回跌後、就中尤以國糯一項最廉、若常丹貨僅售三十七八元、比之高粳及西貢竟相差十元之巨、况平時祇堪作糖紛坯之碎尖、當須四十二三元、則此種出夫情常之糯市、豈無人計及、特以目光羣注於洋米、無暇顧此耳、今則　米平淡、一般視綫遂移注於國糯　着意搜羅、形勢　落、打破平常沉寂空氣、貨主本已顧情身本、不肯輕脫、茲則有機可乘、售價立升二元、計金　特元開四十二元、四十一元半、常丹白元高四十一元、大市四十元左右、次至三十九元、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、其來源因受兩阻、塲外暗盤、傳聞一般貨主、又見天時轉寒、米質無虞、堅意扳守、售價回昂元砠、無錫特淸粳開五十元、紛粳四十九元、常　粳四十八九元、宿四十六七元、靑泗特薄稻五十元、四十九元半、大市四十八九元、南港早稻四十七八元云</p>
<p>洋米目前猛甩後、昨則頗有店　　廉暢辦、所以早市　手、形勢即緊、及後復繼鄕莊客戶跟踪　進、限制浮戶投機交易、雖　定買賣新章、實行限期　款與如期提貨之成例、奈業內外投機熱度木衰、一時未易走入正軌、且新到大批洋米、早由客帮預購　貨即待轉口、而實銷與行囤亦頗　辦、因此開價後一路盤漲、午收已較大五六角、午後謠言利於買方、市乃冉度盤漲、例如小絞上午四十七元半開價大至四十八元、下午又自四十七元半大至四十八元三角、其他各現米午後均大二三角回籠二號西貢原包現貨六十元、五月上期現碼不足、價自六十元零六角至六十元零八角、漲起一元、仍少售出云、</p>
<p>又訊、今日有洋苞米六千二百餘包、裝太古公司順天輪運往威海衛、並有洋米一百二十包、亦運往威海衛、（祖）</p>
<h3>粉市步鬆</h3>
<p>昨日粉市逐漸鬆落、查本客交易均鮮活躍、南洋客銷前經一度發動後、各貨尙在報運、其手續上已不比往日之使利、故新交易猶水能蟬聯、本街零批交易、額數不足五千包、二號粉廠盤、雖未更動、老車牌回籠貨已跌去一角以上、初開十四元一角半、後市鬆至一角、成交亦殊零星、其餘內地雜牌粉價仍須十四元二角左右、買賣正在互持中、又麵粉今（十一日）有一千包、　往烟台、又二千包、運往天津、</p>
<p>小麥昨到銷兩寂擯持如故、</p>
<h3>雜糧　油餅徬徨不定</h3>
<p>邇來油豆餅市事一因實銷不振、二為缺乏新刺激、致人心興趣不常、兩日來市面先因供　於求而疲跌、後受外來利多空氣而復漲、故大局徬徨不定、交易一味間散、昨花生油祇做開靑島油一百七十桶、價為一百十元原盤、豆油共成交大連油二百二十桶、價自一百零五元五角挫至一百零五元、在收幫時復升至一百零六元、大有廠油妥開一百擔、價仍為八十六元、豆餅客帮不動、祇行囤問津元降餅二車、價為十元零四角、同甡餅一千片、價為十元零五角、黃豆去路奇狹、除由榨油廠採去蕪湖豆六百餘包外、其餘安慶豆大連豆完全是掛盤行情</p>

<h3>丈夫何故精力衰退</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培性病專利醫師念會合著</p>
<p>（診所）北京路四川路口中國信託公司二樓</p>
<p>（時間）上午十時至下午六時星期日休息</p>
<p>一分精力，一分事業，精力尤其是愛情的動力！</p>
<p>賢明的妻子，除掉料理家務以外，對於丈夫的精力是否健康，必然特別的關懷！有時丈夫的精力偶然衰退了些，她一定很溫存地慰問着，用心地研究着，究竟是什麽緣故？有何方法恢復或更增强其精力？所以妻子的醫學常識也是很需要的。由此一點看起來，丈夫若眞心愛護其妻子，當先自愛護其精力始。誠然，一個精力豐市的男子和一個健美的女郎結婚，他們的婚後生活一定很幸福很甜蜜，愛情　　，生男育女，這是一個多麽美滿的家庭！同時，男子因有愛情的鼓勵，必然益發的勇敢，週到與努力，這是多麼有助於事業的前進！所以有很多的男女，自美滿地結婚以後，抱着相愛相助，協乃同心之　，努力地奔赴他們光明而幸福的前呈，好像數十年似一日，等到哲嗣　孫，都能揚名顯祖，而老夫婦稱觴祝壽之時，　考康寗，福何似！</p>
<p>反之，夫婦若不知珍惜其精力，或於早年已犯自凟縱慾，虧損了生殖腺內分泌液者，則男子於婚後每使精力迅速的衰退，而爆發着早　，陽痿，發育不全，精薄不育，神經衰弱等種種症象。可是女子於婚後·在生理上常會增加其性的需要，然丈夫的精力反衰退，於是在性生活中卽難協調，而使愛情陷於毀滅，此在今日時代的女子，或因性的不滿而與人私通私奔或竟振振有詢與夫訴請離婚之訟者，亦屬多不勝計！</p>
<p>依理而論，丈夫精力衰退，自己果應當機立斷，速謀恢復與增强，然在妻子亦應設法為之補救。好在今日醫學昌明，補救已非難事。惟切不可亂服藥與亂投醫。據世界名醫及余等經騐，均以服健壯動物生殖腺素裂劑『生殖素』最為對症特效。因此劑係根據近代醫學上最進步之補給療法的原理。乃由健壯動物如猩猩，虎狼，熊鹿，海狗等體中提取其生殖腺內分泌精華，用科學濃縮複製法精製成劑，所以品質純粹而貴重，藥性溫和而週到，補力積極而偉大，實為任何類似製劑所不及。所以男子於服後一日夜間卽可生精補腎，健腦活血，尤貴不斷連服，則更助長發育，滋養神經，必於短期內治愈各症，使精力倍增豐足，夫婦愛情美滿，中老年人常服，則更延年益壽，返老還童。惟息遺精者，須兼服洽遺特效藥『希米脫氏固精片』（中西五洲等大藥房及永安公司西藥部均售每匣兩元）以制止遺洩，則收效尤速！</p>
<h3>遺精症在夏天的危機</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>春　　　不知不覺中偷偷地回去了，時序已經到了夏天！氣候的溫度一天天地上升，　暑的炎夏的可怕，我想誰都經騐過吧！一個患有遺精症的靑年，夏天的危機就迫在　睫了！因為我人體內的精液，在生理學上言卽所謂生殖腺內分泌液，功能助長發育，促進新陳代謝，滋養腦，性，　髓等各部神經，若患遺精而因循失治，則此種生活源泉卽有逐漸枯竭之虞！於是凡腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰酸背痛，早洩陽痿，發育不全，精力渙散，未老先衰等症象即不一而足。此種虛弱靑年，一至夏天，因氣候炎熱的關係，症象必益惡化，如在求學時代之學生，稍一用腦，卽感頭昏腦脹，耳鳴眼花，學業必一落千丈。若在工商界習業者，稍一操勞，卽感肢體疲憊，工作難能勝任，若在戀愛塲合，因面黃肌瘦，體貌不揚之故，亦每為女性所棄，結婚以後，則在夫婦生活上，更難得到協調的快樂，或竟因此而演出私奔離婚等家庭悲劇！茫茫前途，無往而非窮途末路！</p>
<p>時在初夏，治療遺精尙為未失時機。此時若服治遺特效藥德國希米脫博士所秘製之「希米脫氏固精片」則服後必可鞏固精關，鎭靜神經，當夜即可收安眠止遺之特效。如因遺精已久有上述症象者須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以培補腦腎，精血及神經，能連服一月而不間斷，必可於短期內根治各症，使身體益臻健康。患者若能親來本診所兼報電療·注射等新療術，更可保證治愈。</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3>乳峯萎的缺陷</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培—在初夏彌補最著顯效</p>
<p>誰都知道女子們的愛美觀念，要　加子强烈。不過有許多女子，頭腦實在簡單得可憐！她們的愛美，簡直不顧實際，一味盲目地講究裝飾，要知自己　　　　生得不漂亮，有了種種缺陷，如肌肉枯槁，容顏憔悴，　　瘦削，尤其是乳房平坦，這雖穿上一九四〇年華貴新裝，也似行屍走肉，有什麼肉感動人的美姿？况且現在的男子們看女性，動輙以曲線美為標準，而構成曲線美的主要條件，便是高聳着的一對乳峯，與豐腴而款擺的臀部，如這兩者發育不能臻於美滿，則曲線毫無，如何能婀娜動人？也如何能博得男子們以好感？所以此輩女性，往往被擯於社會，被棄於家庭，結果，其命運必悲慘之至！</p>
<p>然則此輩女性何為而有此不幸？此據世界著名婦科醫師康德林，詹姆士特，及法國美容專家威泥基博士等研究結果。咸認為均因自　束胸，白帶不感，營養障碍，多產難產，重症侵害，以致卵巢機能遭遇摧殘，影响新陳代謝作用所致。唯一挽救方法，自以服生殖腺卵巢內分泌製劑女用「生殖素」最為對症而特效。蓋此劑為德國醫聖斯丹那博士積三十餘年艱辛實驗而發明。其成分純用少壯動物之新鮮卯巢並佐以礦植物之燐，鈣，維他命等珍貴品，在最完善之科學設德下精製。故藥性和平，功效凖確，不分寒暑，均可常服。若在春生夏長之初夏服之，尤顯卓效，倘繼續服用，必能有病治病，無病强身，縱乳峯萎　一似男子，深信在三月後，必可高聳至二英寸以上，那時顫動生姿，妳將心花怒放了。</p>
<p>鐵一般的事實</p>
<p>（一）遺精症幾乎誤了他終身　性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>郭仰之君，徐州人，年廿一，寄宿於本埠某大學肄業，因天資聰頴，學業成績恒列前茅，惟因喜讀艷情小說，至有動乎中，情不自禁的當兒，染上了自凟惡癖，復因自凟斷傷，致性神經衰弱，精關鬆弛，爆發了遺精症，初時每月只有二三次，繼則增至五六次，十餘次，於是感覺腦力衰弱，記憶不良，夜間失眠，日間神息恍惚，稍一勞動，卽覺腰酸背痛，肢體疲憊不堪，於是校中功課一落千丈，上學期考試，未能及格，師友奇之，而郭君自身亦覺莫名其妙，然身體之日漸衰弱，郭君未嘗不「有病自得知」，乃購服市上之所謂「遺精片」之類，然均鮮效果，而症象益見惡化，正憂慮之際，適其友張君為之介紹至本診所診治，經詳細診察其病狀後，知確係由遺精失治之故，卽囑其赴五洲大藥房購治遺精特效藥「希米脫氏固精片」二盒，腦腎大補劑「生殖素」兩打，使之不斷兼服，并間日施用電療注射等新醫衛，為時月餘，頃已百病霍然，腦力淸明，精力强壯，又是一個活躍的靑年了，</p>
<p>（二）早洩陽痿的男子最為妻子所恨</p>
<p>林風君，年廿五，客歲結婚，新婚之夜，夫婚即興勃谿之聲，所以夫婦感情惡劣之極，家底無樂趣可言，綠林君息早　，陽痿症，婚後從未能行其人道，是以妻仍處女，能不懊喪！林君知長此以往，必多後患！乃於上月親至本診所診治，經察知其病症後卽囑其購男子强壯大補劑「生殖素」三打，因略有遺精症，故兼服「希米脫氏固精片」少些，并每日施用迭門氏電療術，經月餘之悉心治療，果覺精强力壯，夫婦間愛情不勝其　　云。</p>

<h3>七盜在江海關前　圖刦稅款百餘萬　日籍解款員被盜擊一槍　字林報英人等四人受傷　一盜中彈成擒餘匪全數逃逸</h3>
<p>福州路外灘江海關大厦內、昨日下午六時十分許、發生鉅刦案、當塲警盜格鬭、雙方共開槍七八響、槍聲密如運珠、傷西人·日人·及路人·汽車夫等共計六人、結果稅收未被搶去、茲訪悉各情如次、</p>
<p>盜匪七人攔住去路</p>
<p>自江海關稅收被日方把持後，每日下午、向例由日商正金銀行派員前往該關後門稅收處、將每日稅收解至正金銀行、昨日下午六時十分、該銀行日籍職員正將現款百餘萬元、準備用自備汽車（租界照會三八八六號、僞照會九三六號）、解回銀行、將該款如數納入車內、即駛出江海關門口之際、詛料突有盜匪七人、三匪穿中裝、四匪穿西裝、攔住去路、各出手槍、威脅押解日員與汽車夫下車、車夫至此、不能强拒、被逼下車、而日員則恐惶萬狀、不敢離車、於是一盜便向該日人開槍一響、彈由該車左側玻璃窗穿入、中渠左臂、</p>
<p>子彈橫飛多人受傷</p>
<p>時江海關門口之兩巡捕、聞警上前、並向盜開槍一響、但未命中、附近印捕（一四一號）亦即趕往、盜等見勢不佳、當即開槍拒捕、希圖逃逸、一時槍聲密如連珠、秩序大亂、行人紛紛逃避、斯時路旁停有銀色汽車一輛、（照會一八二七二號）司機人秦生亭、浦東人、三十七歲、盜匪中之兩人即跳登該車、企圖逃逸、但該司機人堅不肯開車、盜無法、祗得卜車、袖出手槍、向秦開放兩槍、一彈中背部、子彈未穿出、一彈中左脚、流彈擊傷字林西報英籍校對安立德臀部、未幾追盜之一四一號印捕被盜擊中右股、行人曹煥祥（三十四歲、亦遭流彈擊中右肩、</p>
<p>一盜成擒餘匪逸去</p>
<p>中央捕房聞訊後、即遺大批警捕分乘警備車數輛駛往、四面包圍、並斷絕交通、搜査匪踪、一面急召救護車將受傷者分送醫院療治、日人送福民醫院、銀色車夫及曹姓行人、併送寳隆醫院、西人安立德送公濟醫院、至在漢口路大陸銀行前、身中兩搶倒地成擒之盜匪文貴卿（二十二歲）及受傷一四一號印捕、則併送山海關路巡捕翳院、又悉該盜共中兩槍、傷腿部及右手、勢甚沉重、性命危殆、所解稅款、仍完整無恙、未被刦去、當記者事後前往調査時、江海關門前警衛森嚴、附近有日方憲乓數名持槍守望、情勢至爲緊張、</p>
<h3>德侵荷消息到滬　荷領署之表示　荷蘭當局決定抵抗到底　德情報員無以自圓其說</h3>
<p>歐戰形勢擴大、乃爲不可掩之事實、而軍事秘密、尤爲瞬息萬變、微妙不可捉摸、記者甫於前日下午六時、以德荷形勢緊張、是否德有侵荷企圖、叩之德使館情報員柯德、承答、稱德國並無侵荷之需要、不料</p>
<p>言猶在耳</p>
<p>德國軍隊竟入荷蘭邊境、同時空製荷京之消息到滬矣、記者乃以此事往叩柯德氏、冀欲得其眞相、祗見其忽遽之中、若深訝記者之此行、僅云「抱歉、未克叙談、請讀吾人之號外　息可矣」、而別、於是記者乃轉赴、</p>
<p>荷蘭領館</p>
<p>會見秘書葉曼氏、（Yhman）訽其對於德國侵荷之意見、承謂德國攻荷、其目的顯在利用荷蘭爲空軍根據地以攻英法、並威脅法國之後背、荷蘭當局、决意抵抗到底、並計劃開放水閘</p>
<p>以淹德軍</p>
<p>惟能否絕對阻止德陸軍之進攻、須待實行後方知其效、至於荷屬東印度方面、荷海軍亦集中該處、準備應付一切事變、惟該處尙未動員、本埠荷蘭銀行自接到是項消息後、該行之匯兌已於昨日午後突然停做、惟於昨日上午、仍有匯市、爲八元七五、及八元八七五、（平明社）</p>
<p>荷領署接本國電訊</p>
<p>又據另一報吿、本埠荷蘭總領事波薩樊宣稱、領事館方面、業已接獲荷蘭外交部來電、證實德軍已侵入荷境、惟事前德國並未向荷蘭提出任何牒文、該電略稱「德國未向荷蘭提出任何牒文、竟突然侵入荷境、飛機塲已遭德方轟炸」云、又據荷總領稱、遠東荷蘭行政狀况、將不致有何變更、渠又信荷蘭運輸公司在遠東方面、亦不致受若何影響、而改變其路綫、</p>

<p>浙東柏油運滬、現時仍須結匯、前傳弛禁一節、殊不確買、最近內地價高、到滬成本每担在一百十元以上、</p>
<h3>祥泰工人　所提條件</h3>
<p>由林探長轉達資方　毆斃工友已予優卹</p>
<p>英商祥泰木行工潮、昨因被捕工友未蒙釋放、而改善待遇之條件、亟須加以修改、俾得向資方重行提出、特於昨日下午三時、召集全體工友、舉行會議、議決</p>
<p>六項條件</p>
<p>如下、（一）請總大班考倫司向法院交涉、釋放被捕工友梁士濟等六人、並不得停止其工作、（二）每石米價在十三元以上者、每月每名津貼白米五斗、（三）每日工資未滿一元者加叫成、一元以上者加二成、二元以上者加一成、（四）廠方尤許每人每月得向公司買柴一元、計一百市斤、（按該廠之另碎木柴、係由在此次工潮被擊傷之宋友根及王貴生二人承包、其價格售給職員爲每元六十斤、售給工人每元爲三十斤）、（五）取消年終花紅、年底改發二個月之工資、（六）養老金提前在本月底發給、（七）停工期內工資照給、上項條件、經全體工友通過後、將於今晨由中央捕房林探長轉達資方、並促其從速答復、俾得早事解決此次工潮中慘被</p>
<p>擊斃工友</p>
<p>李鳳歧、廠方大班考倫司認渠平日間甚有功績、此次不幸因公犧牲、特於昨晨召死者家屬至廠中面加慰問、除買給上等棺木、出資營葬外、並尤其妻代死者領取工資、養其終身、其八齡女孩之敎育費、亦由廳方供給、</p>
<h3>法駐華參贊返滬　盛讚滇越交通進步　運貸數量激增三倍　不久後將更見進展</h3>
<p>法國駐華大使館商務參贊薜倫氏、年初曾赴重慶及昆明等處遊歷、旅居中國內地、的三月之久、最近始返滬、彼對於滇越間交通狀况發表觀感如次、滇越鐵路現爲中國中要出口通道、該鐵路近因中國之輸出入貿易激增、運貨數量、視前已加三倍、每日的在六百噸以上、以通過山巒起伏之單軌鐵路、此實爲顯著之運輸數量、目前正沿滇越鐵路建築平行綫之公路、此項工程完成時、則中法交通更爲進展、兩國之經濟關係、更爲强化矣、</p>
<h3>法幣匯率變動結果　出乎日方意料　日票價值跟踪慘跌　日國內經濟已動搖　東京興亞院焦盧萬狀</h3>
<p>據日方消息、東京興亞院爲上海法幣問題、前日召開臨時會議討論、結果毫未覓獲具體方案、惟一致對於下述二事、表示焦急而已、蓋日方原以爲法幣匯率變動後、日票在華必增高其購買力、而事實竟相反、日圓與法幣間之兌換比率、仍與法幣匯價尙未變動前無異、（仍爲日票一元、換法幣一元二角餘、）且有扯平趨勢、</p>
<p>日方影響</p>
<p>因而不僅採購棉花及其他工業用原料、由於追以法幣付款之故、使日圓因經過兌換法幣而貶低其在華購買力、即向來直接以日票採購之軍用品、日票購買力亦無昂騰之象、尤其前者、將使日本國內製品成本增加、有刺戟物價、更加騰貴、影響貨物輸出數量更加减少之　、此出席興亞院會議詩人所引爲焦急之點者一、</p>
<p>資金空虛</p>
<p>其次、興亞院中一部閉門造車之人、以為法幣匯價變動、應為促進發行新「鈔票」之良機、但隨同阿部來華而任阿部經濟顧問之靑木一男、鑒於僞「聯準鈔票」之悲慘現狀、認爲僞「中央銀行」之成立、非有莫大資金不爲功、日本方面必須愼重行事、出席興亞院會議諸人、聆取靑木之意見後、莫不瞠目結舌、良久無言、亦足見其內心焦急也、</p>
<h3>英僑婦女　戰時報務展覽</h3>
<p>本埠英僑婦女、熱烈愛護祖國、自歐戰爆發以來、業已盡力爲祖國效勞、茲據大中社記者探悉、本月二十三日上午十時起上海英僑婦女協會決舉行戰時婦女服務展覽會、地點聞在該會會所、又六個月前、英橋婦女會發動編織縫紉總動員、將所有出品、寄回祖國、捐獻作戰勇士、成績極佳、故在此次展覽會中、編織品及衣飾之式樣、將成爲最精彩之部份、凡本埠英僑協會會員、均希望前往參觀、並不吝予以批評、</p>
<h3>工部局否認　職員加薪</h3>
<p>據泰晤士報云、工部局某要員否認工部局最近將公佈增加各級職員薪俸百分之二十或二十五、但因黑匯變動、生活程度高漲、加薪問題、恐不免發生、該要員復謂任用委員會對於該問題尙未加以討論、須待有所決定時、方將該建議提出董事會通過、彼復否認工部局將對發給養老金規例有所更改、最近傳說工部局職員根據其服務時期之長短、得准其支出養老金總額之　　、實則事實上雖有此需要、但尙未實現、</p>
<h3>（記）（一）米價雖漲至百元一担　亦漠不關心之怪人　（安）</h3>
<p>從前米價漲至十四五元一担時，個個人嫌貴，如今米價漲至四五十元一担，也祇好逆來順受，此乃時勢使然，迫得至此，然而竟尙有一種人物，米價雖漲至百元一担，也宛如與他風牛馬不相及，他既非百萬豪富，米貴不在他心上，也非囤米商人，米越貴越窩心，乃是一種身患胃病，時常作痛，吃不多，吃不進，吃起來像數珍珠的喙幾顆便算完了，筵席上早退，聚餐會除名，本來民以食爲天，如今胃納一少，營養不足，體力日衰，肌肉瘦削，你道可憐不可憐，</p>

<h3>平準會應先規定　物價最高限度　法租界平準方案已宣佈　全市薪給階級呼籲加薪</h3>
<p>法公董局日用品平價委員會、經於五月九日、在法公董局議事廳舉行全體大會、當由米糧小組委員會零售業小組委員會及煤料小組委員會各提有報吿、經討論後、計通過各方案如次、（一）採行改善米市及煤市狀况之辦法、（二）改組法租界內各菜塲、（三）統制麵包價格、此等方案、經已提呈法國總領事核行矣、至改組法租界內各菜塲、據大中社記者探悉，當局決劃定八仙橋小菜塲之一部、招商承辦、作爲出售外人食用品之用、</p>
<p>標價應先規定限價</p>
<p>滬市物價高漲、租界當局因鑒民生困苦、規定商號交易必須標價、此事現尙未見諸整個實施、本市公信會　事務所曹會計師、頃提出建議、請工部局對標價交易先規定最高限價、以防漲價仍漫無止境、最近租界當局、因市上代客贖當營業、足爲盜匪銷贓之幫助、業予取締、逗切籲睛工部局對於生活品投機買賣、亦予同樣辦理、設不如此、平民生計、社會安寗、岌岌可慮、目前谷項生活品飛漲、莫不由於投機者作祟、此種以播弄民衣民食爲發財途徑者、決非社會所能容忍、租界當局爲維護治安計、應嚴予取締、聞法租界當局、決定各零售商店、須將貨品、標明價格、（一）貨便之揭示、須在公路上能望及之、（二）貨品無論陳列在店內店外、標簽價値、概須用亞拉伯字標明單位、售價數字之面積、不得在三公分以下、關於貨品標價辦法、日內劇將實施、</p>
<p>煤麵漲價不合情理</p>
<p>本埠煤屑市塲、自以美金標價後、極爲外間注意，該業雖飾詞掩護、惟事實昭然、據大通社記者昨日向該　市塲探悉、煤屑懸價、仍標美金、惟因美滙放長、故售價亦隨比率稍减、昨日煤球每擔售價、仍爲八元四角、因煤業有識人士、亦認此次煤屑漲價之不合情理、已在進行壓平、故市價尙將回跌、以平衆怒、上海市商會、以接據機製切麵業公會函、請抑平麵粉售價後、當即分函福新·阜豐·兩公司、以査目前滙價之縮、祇能影響於新訂美麥之結價、並未妨及已製待售之麵粉、該公會同業、均係小本經紀、所營業務、亦與大衆民食有關、急切呼籲、自有其不得已情形、本會以爲當此時艱、凡屬商人、應謀互助、對於社會、應具同情、該公會所謂呈睛當局嚴厲取締一層、如咸能自覺自治、原不必多此一舉、爰以商人立塲、與貴公司切商兼籌並顧辦法、務祈開誠見示爲企、</p>

<p>靜安寺捕房中西警員兩人、前晚在滬西「歹土」境、被僞警局扣留達四小時、記者訪悉其經過情形如下、緣有靜安寺捕房外籍副督察長古洛勃可夫、前晚十一時、偕華探一名、赴極司非而路近愛文義路處某戶調査有關侵佔案之事件、詎有不三不四之便衣華人數名、突在該宅出現、阻撓租界警務人員行使職務、彼此爭論片刻後、古洛勃可夫偕華探赴附近一偽警分局報吿、當被帶至極司非而路十三號僞警滬西總局、竟强予扣留、靜安寺捕房聞訊後、即派外籍督察長麥克法蘭前往交涉、直至昨晨三時三十分、僞警局始將古洛勃可夫及華探釋出、並由僞員一人向督察長麥克法蘭鄭重道歉、工部局警務處處長鮑恩少校昨日表示、關於此事、因僞警局已向督察長道歉、故不致再提正式抗議、惟警務富局對此事經過、當加調査、然後再定是否有採取其他步骤之必要、</p>
<h3>某西人返滬談　歐戰與遠東商業　未來海空大戰之觀測（續）</h3>
<p>一個能操縱海洋的國家，牠就能進攻何任國家，雖不一定必操勝算，但他既能進攻，就有勝利的希望。英國海軍比德國的强四倍，英國有二·〇七九·八六三噸，法國有八一五·〇〇〇噸，德國有五四一·一二三噸。自從一九一六年五月三十一日裘德蘭之役德海軍爲英擊敗後，直到現在，仍未復元，他們所能發揮的，只有潛水艇。潛水艇擊沉船隻殺害人命雖很有效，但英國用驅逐艦護航後，大見成效。上决大戰用潛水艇不能戰勝，這次恐亦不能冽外。而英國海上封鎖的政策，使德國大受威脅。現在把開戰以來雙方所受損失分列於下。</p>
<p>德國　（袖珍戰艦）損失已經證實者，有斯比將軍號，未證實者有希爾將軍號，（重巡洋　）勁魯撤號，（輕巡洋艦）卡　魯希號，及另外四艘，（驅逐艦）約十二艘（潛水艦）不下五六十艘。</p>
<p>英國　（大型戰艦）損失者奧克號一艘，（航空母艦）勇敢號一艘，（輕巡洋艦）的四艘，（驅逐艦）共十艘，（潛水艇）五艘。</p>
<p>德國要得勝，那必須毀滅英國海軍，但觀看上表記載，過去兩方的海軍損失，照份量的比例上說，德國還比英國重六。現在兩方在建造中的，德國有三萬五千噸巨型戰艦四艘，一萬九千二百五十噸航空母艦二艘，一萬噸重巡洋艦五艘，八千噸輕巡洋艦四艘，一千噸左右潛水艇數十艘。英國方面，有三萬五千噸至四萬噸巨型戰艦九艘，二萬三千噸航空母艦六艘，五千四百五十噸至八千噸輕巡洋艦二十三艘，一千九百二十噸驅逐艦十六艘，二千六百五十噸水雷敷設艦四艘，其他各式輔助艦的數十艘。從這樣看來，英國海軍，比德國强四倍的實力，非但能保持，而且有增加的可能，因爲英國造船事業發達，建造時所需時日，較德國减少，於是造艦速率便增加了。那麽，德國的海軍既遠遜英國，能吾用空軍毀滅英國海軍呢？恐怕也很少希望的。英國敢和德國作戰，就因爲他們知道封鎖能置德國於死地，而德國空軍無論怎樣都不能毀滅英國海軍的。德國空軍，的確比英法强。可是在防空設備完養的條件下，轟炸的效果也並不很大。德國空軍曾飛五百六十哩炸英海軍根據地，甚至一日轟炸四次，結果損失很少，而飛機每爲高射砲所擊落。何况中途還要遭受襲擊呢？至於陸軍，德國的軍力雖比較强大，但要從馬奇諾防綫方面着手，那是不够優越的。因爲進攻者的實力，至少須勝過防守者三倍。時間是有利於聯軍的，英法並不想進攻德國的齊格斐防綫，德國雖有利於速戰速決，但要從這方面進攻也不會有什麼效果。</p>
<p>歐洲戰事這樣演進，今後的大規模海空戰既不可避免，德國空軍，雖比較略占優勢，而空軍的戰果又並無多大效能，英國的海軍又如此牢不可破，勝敗之數，尙有待於將來的開展呢！「龍」　（續完）</p>

<h3>工部局經濟委員奚玉書　談滬市物價問題　投機與投資不同安危殊異欲維繫人心先須調整薪給</h3>
<p>工部局經濟委員奚玉書氏、近發表談話如下、上海市物價飛漲、未曾有今日之甚者、一日之間、其價格增加數成上下、此表示並非本身價値之驟增、而實爲囤購及投機者之競相爭利所致、此風不戢、來茲形勢、將每况愈下矣、我人欲戢止此項恐怖形勢、則須切實履行下列各項、</p>
<p>戢止漲風</p>
<p>關於戢正漲風、現時租界當局、業已定就標明售價辦法、但此項辦法、對於不顧民生之商人、究係消極、蓋今日商號漲價情况、漫無止境、今日二成、明日三成、此項不合理之漲度、如任其自由、則整個社會物價必受波動、而平民生計、陡增困難、故爲戢止漲風、須進一步規定、商號因成本增大而有漲價之必要、須於事前聲請、經過核准手續、方可漲價、如是則商品標價、始能全趨合理、在漲之風、當可戢於無形矣、非然者、徒賴標明售價、則商號儘可自由改變、當局固無所控制其弊端、</p>
<p>勸止投機</p>
<p>關於勸止投機、已由社會上一致作道德上之呼籲矣、但投機者、此仆彼　、猖獗如在、惟物極必反、不可不愼、此不得不再度忠吿於此輩喪心病在者、今日上海、已成爲畸形發展狀態、消費者多、生產者少、投機謀利、固可獲財、但數十方里之內、行將見富人愈富而究屬少數、窮人愈窮、而日見衆多、商業基礎、究築於多數消費之上、如果多數民衆、咸化爲涸轍待盡之附、則富人之資積、咸將化爲凍結之疆石、同時其財產之享受、勢將消失、財產之安寗、亦將不保、此則不得不請投機者、爲之猛省、是以吾人希冀投機者、應改業爲投資者、養精儲源、而社會有不息之生機、</p>
<p>調整薪給</p>
<p>關於調整薪給、更屬重要、査物價極度在漲、貨幣無形貶値、而一般薪給階級、生活大苦、在昔日以月給五十元爲已足者、今雖百元、猶虞不足、物價漲而人價跌、此背道而馳者也、物價連漲之結果、資本主大得其利、則對於雇員、亦應增加其薪給、務使其能有維持生存之能力、吾則爲富不仁、實屬不取、聞各銀行爲解決此項問題計、有規定以物價指數之增度、作爲津貼之比率、願各業當局、亦聞風繼起、實行此種方法、庶使一般生活、得到合理標準、不獨工作效率可以增加、社會秩序、亦賴以安定、</p>

<p>國庫稅收、原無兩致、但商民旣享稅款繳納之便利、復免受滙費之差損、得益實多、此所以體恤商艱、亦即在獎勵其愛國之熱忱、切望滬正商民、共體斯旨、除分令外、合行令仰該處知照、並仰轉知滬市各業商民爲要等因、査本處前據上海各商民陳述、因有分號或聯號設在川滇各省、貨款兌寄困難、應繳稅款因四滯納、當爲</p>
<p>體恤商艱起見、會經商定委託重慶昆明中央銀行代收本處稅款、先由上海商號塡就報吿表單、及應送附件、一併送交本處存核、並申請本處給予證明函件、寄往重慶或昆明、將應繳所得稅款、憑函送交就地中央銀行代收、掣取收據寄滬、再將收據之號碼及收款年月日、抄　本處、以憑稽核、歷經照辦、商民稱便、茲奉前因、此項繳納稅款方法之適用範圍、旣經</p>

<h3>母親與十字架　（一）</h3>
<p>婦女有她的弱點，也有她的優點。數千年來。我們中國重男輕女，不承認婦女在家庭和國家所站的地位。迨爲我國積弱原因之一。現在我們宣積極宣揚婦女的優點，提高婦女的地位。今大我選出此題來討論，也就是這個意思。十字架是犧牲的表記，愛。的表記，母親的職實，也是犧牲和愛的工作。基督是敎會的中心，母親是家庭的中心。耶穌的母親站在十字架旁邊所看見的與常人所見的不同。常人所見的只是一幕悲據，她於此之外，却看出來愛心究竟什麽，並且反映出她自己的愛心是怎樣。耶穌在十字架上向下望着他的母親，見她不哭泣，也表示出永不統滅的愛心。母親與十字架可以相提並論，有如下數點二（一）「母親」暗示出個人的正義，記得某君有一句說話，上帝不能處處顧到，所以給世人劇造母親。」這句話表面看雖覺有點幼稚，但是實質上却是說，上帝在「母親」裏面，凡不知道上帝，不明白神學的地方，上帝總是借着「母親」的愛心，向人說話。母親的職責，早把耶穌潜人　罪，和在十字架受苦的意義，向人表示出來。一個小孩子，在沒有神的觀念之前，就認識母親，他看母親的人格，只差于天使一點。做母親的如不合孩子的理想，這是孩子危險的起點。家庭敎育的主要宗旨，就在維持這個標準，使母親成爲孩子理想中人物。　（待續）　如欲詳細硏究請函郵箱一二二七號</p>

<h3>羅斯福的保鑣</h3>
<p>— 李紹忠</p>
<p>在美國有一個人，他的小照時常在報紙上出現，而總不見刊出他的姓名來。這位神秘人物，就是美國元首羅斯福氏的最親信保鑣。無論什麽時候，一當羅斯福總就在公衆之前出現時，道位神秘人員從來不曾離開羅氏身旁超出數呎之外的。</p>
<p>羅斯福總統這位心腹鑣師，名叫快得爾司（ThomasQualters)，有着一頭鬈髪，一對藍眼。他是愛爾蘭人，從前在波斯頓當過警察。羅斯福總統當站立唱國歌時，一隻手總是要扶着快得爾司的臂膀的（見圖）。每次羅斯福坐在汽車中，慢慢地駛過一處熱鬧城市時，快得爾司也總是站在汽車的踏板上。在華盛頓京城總統辦公廳的應接室四周，有一個闊肩的靑年，臀部的褲袋突起，經常很安詳地踱着步，好像在無事徘徊，他就是快得爾司。</p>
<p>快得爾司正式的官銜，就是總統生命之保護長。對於保衛總統的生命，原是整個「秘密警察局」的集體工作；但快得爾司則負着私人的責任。他早上陪伴總統上辦公廳，晚上又緊隨在總統身旁回到白宮來</p>
<p>通常，快得爾司穿着一身用厚呢製成的制服。但當總統舉行外交茶會時，你就可以看到快得爾斯身上，也是穿着漂亮高貴的燕尾服，打着白領結，站在距總統數步之外的地方。如果在外交茶會席上，發現任何一位無經騐的外國高級外交官員，很不經心地把兩手揷在衣袋裏，或兩手交义盤在胸前，而向總統走了近去，那麽快得爾司便會立刻跟着走上去，以很拘謹的態度，用手指輕輕地在那位外交大員的肩上拍一下，叫他把手放下來。</p>
<p>快得爾司在白宮中是以機敏著稱的，有一决當總統的汽車在某城街上駛過時，一個路人手中揮着一條擦鞋布，而迎面向總統的汽車念遽衝來。那條擦鞋布當然使人遠看會疑心有什麽武器握在手裏。快得爾司當即從汽車踏扳上跳下，跑前兩步，用着聲東擊西的手法，把那個人打倒在路旁陰溝裏去了。事後調査結果，才曉得此人原來是拳擊錦標呢。快得爾司向人解釋道：「人們常在要想跑近總統的汽車時，步伐變得很匆急，那實在是一樁極不好的錯誤。我們對於每個人都是「知其面而不知其心」的，所以我們不能曉得他們要想跑近總統的動機何在。美國「秘密警察局」自一九〇二年成立以來，對於總統生命的保護，，從來不曾失過事。我們當然希望能一直保持這光榮。』</p>
<p>思想</p>
<h3>中華民族的大業</h3>
<p>— 品品</p>
<p>偶然讀到愛沙尼亞作家凱綺賽琳的「一個哲學家的遊歷日記」裏討論中國的一章，我非常感動，像受了什麽大刺激似的。凱氏與英國的羅素一樣以極大的希望寄托在我們的國家，都相信吾國能幹出一番驚天動地的大業，比之我們一般麻木不仁的人實在高超得多。</p>
<p>凡是本國人討論本國的事，不楚疾首痛恨，便是夜郞自大，很少能有客觀公尤冷靜的分析，像同外國人的討論那樣，雖他們還不免有幾分隔膜。凱氏的硏究中國固然有的出於「好奇心」，但大部分都有精湛獨到的見解，而最特出的是在有一個能網羅一切的概念，我們能借了這個概念明白吾國的種種變化與事實，而且十分正確。</p>
<p>例如，在凱氏的寄望中，我們看到這樣一句：『中國人的性質，一方面，代表過去時代發展的一個休息，他方面，則顯爲將來理想的一個預兆。』這是一個極確常的定論。中國有着沉重的過去，在這「過去」上刻劃了我們的全部成就，同時也刻劃了我們的全部失策。我們應該使失策休息，即是說，不蹈覆轍：然而我們應該發揚我們的成就，讓將來的理想在裏面孕育出來。我們在一個過渡的時代，特別在今天，因此又需要我們最大的努力，來完成中華民族對於自身對於全人類的大事業。</p>
<p>據凱氏的意見，中華民族有兩個顯著的特性：（一）非個人主義：（二）善於記憶。凱氏根據這兩個概念，得到上述的定論，我們也能認可這兩個概念。</p>
<p>第一個特性的涵義是這樣的：我們不及歐洲人那樣個人主義化，這是誰都明白的：我們所表現出來的是形式主義，就是一切都得有整整齋齊的形式，凡百事物皆合條理與系統：這個結果使我國產生抽象的思想，因抽象的思想最注重形式的統一。這種非個人主義的特性是好還是壞？</p>
<p>凱氏認爲這一種特性有好也有壞。壞的是牠阻礙了個人的創造，疏忽了人生的最深與處，根倡甲庸，不努力於理想的實現。但牠的價値却並不因此减低，牠表示將來理想社會的一個重要形態——人與人之間的　和。將來的社會決不會再走入個人主義，而將走上超個人主義，這與中國的特性確很相像。把壞的丢去，先養成自我的完善，然後向「融和」的一點發展去，則社會理想可達到了。眞是『休息』與「預兆」的關頭，我們應該覺悟。</p>
<p>第二個特性「善於記憶」是「長於革新」的對立物，所以我們常有保守性，別的東方民族也常如此。因善於記憶，生活方式變成更經久，而文化形態也不會很快就衰退。凱氏相信，西方文化假使「進步」一停止就會跌落，牠的維持全靠繼續不斷的新發明。這是一個危機，或因一時失了平衡而整個地消滅。西方文化走得太快，却沒有根基；補救的辦法是用我們的「善於記憶」。當然，我們有點太保守以至進步太少，今後應稍「長於革新」一些。「捨短取長」，東西文化結爲一體，也便是人類命運轉捩的一天。</p>
<p>爲自己，爲人類，從今天起建設我們的大業。</p>
<p>敎育</p>
<h3>中學生的彷徨</h3>
<p>— 林炎德</p>
<p>化了六年寳貴的光陰與精神，我於去年冬天，通過了最後的關口（畢業考試），離開了中學的大門，因了經濟關係，不擬升學，想謀一個職位。在這人浮於事的社會上，招考幾個小職員，每有五六百人前往應徵，求職是如何渺茫呵！畢業即失業的陰影，立刻襲上心頭，最近雖因投老某大公司，倖獲錄取，但我不得不感覺整個中學畢業生出路問題的嚴重，與學習的課程不能和應用相符。</p>
<p>中學畢業生失業的原因，一半固由於社會制度的缺陷，然中學敎育本身不善，實難辭其咎。就理論上講，中學敎育乃是升大學的一個預備階段，但事實上，一般家長將其子女維持至高中畢業，已頗不易，升大學者，不過少數中的少數，其餘不升學者的出路，自成問題。</p>
<p>我不願對中學敎育過分指責，然普通高中，課程實覺太爲繁重，計有國文，英文，數學，（包括代數，三角，立體幾何，解析幾何）生物，物理，化學，史地，公民等等，各科的敎學，敎師開留聲機，學生聽講記誦，應付考試，以得分數為滿足。一般學校實騐設備全付缺如，最好的學生不過死記方程式而已。學校營業化，尤爲最大缺陷。敎師販賣知識餬口，學生臨時抱佛脚，混騙分數得資格，實爲最可痛心之事。因此中學畢業生，幾乎百無一能，到處碰壁，又是當然的事了。</p>
<p>最近敎育部公佈修正初高中敎學時數表，高中自第二年起分爲甲乙兩組，乙組以準備就業爲主，課程分量略予减輕。自第三年起各校可酌設簡易職業科目（如商業，簿記，會計，打字，農藝，合作社等），學生可選習一種或二種（請閱本報三月二十二日敎育消息欄）。是已將中學課程予以改善，希望滬上各校立即遵行，同時設備的充實，師資的良善，數學方法的改良，敎本的選擇，皆爲切要之事，尤盼高中第三年，無論學生擬升學或就業，皆予以個別指導。不久又要放暑假了，賢明的敎育家及學校當局，對於徬徨於十字街頭的迷路羔羊，將有以善導之吧！（却酬）</p>
<p>史話</p>
<h3>歷史的敎訓</h3>
<p>— 史樹</p>
<p>歷史固然不會重演，但寳貴的歷史，足够鼓勵我們的勇氣。當我讀到土耳其近代史中，凱末爾將軍抵禦希軍，經過八年來連綿的爭戰，土國大部領土，被協約國所佔領，海港都被封鎖，軍火未有輸入。此時土國有一部份的人民，悲觀失望，而且衆議員與軍隊，也相率籲求和平。那時土國的情形，有些地方確似我國現在的情形。如海港被封鎖，極少份子妥協和平。但我們可以說：現在我國的情形，比那時土國的情形，要好得多了。譬如，我們的軍隊與人民，始終沒有悲觀失望。土國雖然有這樣的壞現象，但凱末爾將軍猛烈反對一切懦弱的行動，準備忍苦最後的掙扎，他喚起議昌們積極的精神，在戰塲上鼓勵士兵殺敵的勇氣，在內地則設法安慰人民的疾苦。他所期待的時機，果然到了。至一九二二年八月二十五日，採取總攻勢，進逼希軍，克復要隘，節節勝利。土軍乃長驅直入斯密那。此時敵方倒向土軍要求休戰了。於是土軍在有實力下談判和議，而土耳其乃收復歐洲舊有領土。</p>
<p>最後，我願意把凱末爾將軍的幾句至理名言，介紹給國人：「我們的民族是不會滅亡的；除非這地球的殼面小堅實，不能載我們的棺木的重量，我們的民族方會滅亡」。</p>
<h3>樂仁醫院尹院長訪問記（一）</h3>
<p>特備巨型X光缐機　切實推行防癆運動</p>
<p>古拔路樂仁翳院，最近添聘識騐俱當之各科職員，增加設備刷新內部，已誌前報，記者昨以事趨訪該院院長尹博士，承發表關于防癆運動之意見如次：</p>
<p>「我國每年死亡率，占全世界首位，以肺癆致死者爲數尤巨，國民所受損失，實勝于任何災難，長此以往，危害民族前途極爲可慮！上海地窄人稠，空氣惡劣，爲癆菌繁殖之所，防遏之計，急不容緩。</p>
<p>用X光線檢肺，爲防癆要舉，吾人幾已盡知，但欲得到優良效果必須有新頴巨型之X光機，主持醫師，尤須識驗俱富，如檢肺最初步之透視工作，醫師在事前須適當的調節目光，檢査時須十分細心，雖如此，最微小之結核結節，仍易忽略，確切辦法，惟有攝影，而攝影之時間，電力，與受檢人體之大小，年齡等，均有關係，冲洗照片之時間，藥水之溫度，亦須適當，如此始可得到優良之照片，以便診斷。診斷方面，尤屬重要，若以有病斷爲無病，貽誤病家治療機會，以無病斷爲有病，使受檢人之精神，飽受「莫須有」之痛苦，本院特聘專家主持診斷，倘遇懷疑，更請X光專家共同研究，務使診斷確切，庶可對症治　，方期事半功倍。（待續）</p>

<h3>卡爾登之理想陣容</h3>
<p>— 王初</p>
<p>現在卡爾登麒老牌領導下之移風劇團，其配角陣容，尚稱堅强，茲草擬一理想陣容，以冀成一更完美之劇團。頭牌當屬之麒老牌，由金素琴，張翼鵬懸並二牌以輔之。金伶在南方坤伶中，可稱首屈一指，旣有扮相，又有做派唱工，素負前進坤伶之雅號，若與周氏合作，宣乎相得益彰矣。</p>
<p>軍於張翼鵬，亦屬個中翹楚，凡曾觀彼四平山北湖州諸劇者，均深悉其開打之乾淨俐落，矯捷穩準。麒老牌得斯人佐助，頗能收牡丹綠葉之功。</p>
<p>請于素蓮回老家掛三牌，較易適宜。以其獨當一面，固嫌不够，今使其歸依座下，亦不失爲一良好配角；其唱工做派，已通大路。他如劉斌崑亦稱麒派良將，劉原係移風社基本演員，後因故脫離，轉入黃金，頗受台下歡迎，每次出台，掌聲如雷；惜乎嗓音不能響亮，設有馬富祿之嗓，稱之南北第一名丑，當非過譽也。</p>
<p>今如重返移風社，又有許多合作佳奏。原有移風社之陣容中，高百歲懸特別牌，希其多飾銅觀其演是類角色，頗能稱職，高本錢甚佳，歌時可稱得黃鍾大呂，望多加研究，專工銅錘，此在高本人恐不願當，但縱觀移風社，僅有何英奎係銅錘本工，顧劇中較重之角色，不能勝任，則非高莫屬矣。</p>
<p>小生一角，南方無一佳者。嘗見劉文魁串演，尚能應付，凡小生角色，可由彼充任。其餘王蘭芳之花旦，堪與芙蓉草相頡頏；路凌雲之架子二花，張月亭劉　亭之掃邊老生，均不失爲硬裏子，足爲主角生色。</p>
<p>有李長山者，亦係移風社員，名不甚彰，懸牌甚低。此人藝甚佳，生丑兼飾，聞與麒老牌係師弟兄，望多加提携，勿使彼黯黯無聞，致湮沒其材</p>
<p>上述之理想陣容，茍獲當局採納，出諸實現，則更爲觀眾歡迎也無疑。</p>
<h3>「阿Q」前奏</h3>
<p>— 阿漢</p>
<p>「阿Q正傳」在魯迅先生，不但奠定我國新文學的思想傾向，同時也無疑的，奠定魯迅先生在世界文壤的權威。因爲這是一部反封建的充滿正義感的作品，因此我國很多戲劇作家，都曾具有把它搬上舞臺的勇氣，但因魯迅生前，深恐一旦上了舞臺，反違反了原有意義，所以始終表示反對。後來魯迅先生逝世，許多戲劇作家當然再也忍耐不住，於是，如田漢袁牧之許幸之諸位先生，都紛紛爲「阿Q正傳」改編劇本。記得去年上海劇藝社，一度公演「阿Q」，那是許幸之先生的劇本。</p>
<p>最近，中旅在「新梅幕香」後，也擬上演「阿Q」，這是陳瑜先生改編的，陳瑜不用介紹得，也是國內第一流的戲劇作家，因此意識上自然非常準確。中旅對於此劇，很是重視，不但目下正在積極排練，而且陣容方面，可說是中旅全團總動員，全部重要的演員，計有趙恕趙太爺，吳純真趙太太，葛鑫趙七爺，唐棣趙秀才及監獄長，黃河魯大，湯琦孔乙己及徐二虎，王微六斤姑娘及小尼姑，林娜八一嫂，孫景路七斤嫂，藍青吳媽，廖凡王癩鬍及紅眼睛阿義等等。</p>
<p>過去，中旅每次的演劇，在演者往往採取甲乙制，如今却因不够支配，有的要演雙角，可知是一次大規模的演出。其中主角阿Q，爲導演季景波兼演，他純熟的演技，流利的白口，在內地早已著譽一時，上海似乎比較陌生一些，不過在「葛嫩娘」中的博洛，「兩個世界」中的白次山，也已留給一般觀者深刻的印象，按我的目光，在他主演阿Q，準能相當成功。全劇共分五幕，大約需要三個小時以上的演出。</p>

<h3>觀硯秋初演鎖麟貴　簡評　（下）</h3>
<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>優點三　末塲，趙守貞問薛媽（即薛湘靈，）因何見鎖麟　哭泣，先無座位，及答數語，命丫環爲設一座，再問答數語，將座移爲客位，再問答數語，知確爲昔年贈財寶之恩人，乃將座改爲上座，又加丫頭之打蟬，極有趣味，惟丫環有「木能生火……」之語，粗而不當，可以刪去。</p>
<p>弱點　全劇中用丑角六七人之多，閒話太絮煩，可以歸併節省，以清頭緒。又花園中薛氏帶廬公子遊戲，時間過長，看客覺得沉悶，後宜减少。</p>
<p>今論硯之唱，硯秋唱工，本有獨到，近二年來，更加精密，此劇中遇　贈　一塲之二六板及流水各段，如斜風吹　雨，兩點從上斜下，滴滴有力，普能利用陰平覺傲高腔，句句提住，似虞褚字體，瘦硬通神，腔亦別開生面，唱此等腔，吾知其最　氣力，因字字皆是提住唱出也。花園中唱二箸有一句尾，從底處陡然　至極高，又復落歸主昔，此種唱法入耳甚生，可謂新極；如做詩之用險韻者耶。團圓一塲之二六板中，「原着板」加「哭頭」，「兒的娘」，「我的兒」之腔，似南梆子而變尾，頓覺新奇，汪派長亭中二六有原着板之哭頭，青衣從來未有，總之，全劇婆婆唱極繁重，無一句不新，此戲一出，壓倒一切矣。硯秋於做工欲像真，於悲哀或羞慚時白口特別發聲世小，此　吾以爲有令台下聽不清楚之虞，不知可以改響一些否？</p>
<h3>葉秋心秋雲艷　今日聯袂赴平津</h3>

<p>葉秋心的姪女秋雲艷（按，是故伶張銘武之女，原名學珍），是一位後起的坤伶，有志上進，要到北平去深造，恰巧碰到秋心到天津的機會，她們就決定同走，這次她北上投師，是王瑤卿，尚小雲兩位，準備在那裏埋頭用功一番，等藝術有了相當的成就，再組班演唱，在短期內是不打算回到上海來。秋雲艷是一位美麗聰明的孩子，如果真能孜孜研求，光明前途，總有她的份吧。</p>

<h3>Hitler Personally Goes to the Front Lines to Supervise the Battle; Issues Message to All Soldiers</h3>
<p>German Supreme Headquarters: Dispatches from here state that, in view of the enemy's direct expansion of the war to the territories of Belgium and the Netherlands, and because the Ruhr area is threatened, German forces on the Western Front crossed the western border and launched an attack at dawn this morning. At the same time, German air forces attacked enemy air force bases and assisted the army in fighting the enemy. Head of State Hitler, in his capacity as Supreme Commander, has gone to the front lines in person. (Haitong dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Head of State Hitler issued an important message today, as follows: Soldiers on the Western Front, the final moment of deciding Germany's future has arrived. In other words, the time for the decisive battle has come. For three hundred years, the rulers of Britain and France have aimed to prevent Germany from truly uniting, and they have especially wanted to suppress Germany to keep it permanently weak and powerless. France has always had this ambition, so it has declared war on Germany thirty-one times in the past two hundred years. The British authorities have repeatedly hindered Germany's unity and have also prevented Germany from obtaining the resources to maintain the welfare and life of 80 million people. Regardless of the political system of the countries at the time, Britain implemented this continuing policy, and the target they wanted to attack was the German people. The people governing Britain and France have now openly admitted their goal: to divide Germany into several small countries. If they are allowed to achieve their goal, Germany will not only lose its political power but also lose the right to defend the survival of the German people in the world. The German people have no animosity towards the people of Britain and France, but because it is a matter of life and death today, the responsibility of self-defense cannot be shirked. In the past few weeks, German troops, driven by righteous indignation, have taken the lead in defeating the pawns of Britain and France. Now that Poland is pacified, Germany has no worries in the East. Britain and France decided to attack Germany from the north. But since April 9th, this conspiracy has also been destroyed by German troops. Recently, France attempted to divert our attention to Southeast Europe and secretly plotted to attack the Ruhr through the Netherlands and Belgium. Their intentions can be described as treacherous. Soldiers on the Western Front, the time has come. The struggle that begins today will determine the fate of Germany and the German people for thousands of years to come. May all our soldiers strive and work hard for the country and the nation. The entire people are behind you. May victory be with you. (Haitong dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>German Military Report</h3>
<p>Berlin: Official dispatches this afternoon stated that several squadrons of the German Air Force landed at airfields in Belgium and the Netherlands at dawn this morning, carrying soldiers. These airfields and the surrounding areas were quickly brought under military control. Military airfields in eastern and central France were also bombed and set on fire by German aircraft, causing considerable damage. The airfields of Saint-Omer, Vitry, Le Francoeur, and Meaux suffered the most damage and have been destroyed. After the Belgian government requested British and French troops to enter Belgium, and the Dutch government declared war on Germany, the scope of German air strikes has been expanded. Military targets in the Netherlands and Belgium are also included in their attacks. The airfields of Antwerp and Brussels were bombed by German aircraft. One of Belgium's strongest fortresses has been captured by German troops. The German Air Force's highly effective cooperation with the Army is the main reason for their success.

There is no plan to change uniforms. (Haitong dispatch, 10th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The High Cost of Medicine and the Public's Health</h3>
<p>From rice and grains to fuel and cloth, everything is hoarded by speculators and manipulated by merchants, causing prices to skyrocket and greatly impacting people's livelihoods. Those who rely on their physical labor, even if they are fortunate enough to have a healthy appetite, find that their hard work is not enough to cover their basic needs of food and clothing. Unfortunately, if they fall ill, the cost of medicine has also risen along with everything else, making it almost impossible for ordinary patients to afford it. Western medicines, in particular, are mostly manufactured in England, America, Germany, and France. Since the outbreak of the European war, medicines have also become a target for speculation. Some are locked away, waiting for even better prices to be offered; others are treated as rare commodities, with prices soaring by 30-50% or even doubling depending on the exchange rate of the day. Chinese medicines mostly come from the mainland, and price increases have their own reasons. Alas, the torment of both physical illness and economic hardship is forcing people to their limits. The suffering of patients is unimaginable!</p>
<p>People cannot avoid getting sick: especially when the cost of living is high, nutrition cannot be as adequate as usual, and living conditions are not as spacious as usual. Illnesses are easily contracted; this is both reasonable and inevitable. It is inevitable to have diseases, and the price of medicine is so expensive; therefore, to preserve life and restore the ability to work and produce, one has no choice but to endure the pain and pay the price. Even with tonics: it seems that those with financial resources can afford them, and those without financial resources can do without them. Since doing without tonics does not harm one's life, it is acceptable to view tonics as a luxury consumption. However, after a serious illness, if the necessary tonics are not given, the illness will not easily heal, health will not easily recover, and one may even suffer for life. Thus, tonics cannot be entirely classified as luxuries. Tonics aside, if ordinary medicines needed to treat illnesses have the most direct relationship with human life and death, but with today's medicine prices, filling a prescription or buying a medicine can cost ten or more gold coins, or even dozens of gold coins. The question then becomes whether one wants to live or not, and whether one has the money or not? If one has no money, one can only wait to die. Indeed, with the difficulty of living today, coupled with the hardship of illness and the expense of medicine, those who live paycheck to paycheck will rely on their existing resistance to ward off the devil of disease. Even middle-class families, if they happen to have a sick person, will be at a loss, not knowing what to do; unable to afford a doctor or medicine, children crying from hunger, family members weeping in silence. Those confined to a sickbed will find this situation unbearable. If they are unwilling to sit and wait for death, they can only suffer the pressure of material hardship and ultimately find it impossible to survive. Such tragic scenes are common throughout society.</p>
<p>The importance of medicine is the same as that of beans, wheat, rice, and cloth. Beans, wheat, rice, and cloth nourish life, while medicine protects life. What we expect of the pharmaceutical industry today is nothing extravagant: only that they value human life, do not engage in hoarding, restrict the supply of stockpiles, do not allow medicines to become stagnant, and do not allow medicine prices to rise sharply. We also hope that public associations will take a position of righteousness, lead the industry, and set prices according to normal standards, carefully avoiding burdening patients with sudden fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. In particular, the prices of medicines necessary for general treatment, which are not tonics, should be jointly maintained at a fair level. If the source of medicines is disrupted or even interrupted due to the war, it is hoped that doctors and pharmacists will strive to research and develop new medicines in a timely manner, utilizing the strengths of domestic medicines and using native medicinal materials, based on science and with reference to established formulas, so as to meet urgent needs. In terms of business, this can make up for the lack of imported goods; and in terms of medicine and pharmacy, it can also make many contributions to this great era. In the so-called total mobilization during wartime, scientists play a very important role. Chinese medicine, on the one hand, follows Europe and America, and indeed there is a sense of being unable to catch up; on the other hand, it should also humbly acknowledge that national medicine has unique treasures that are a legacy unique to other countries. How to apply scientific methods to "excavate" and organize them is the unique responsibility of the Chinese medical community, and this great era is the best opportunity to fulfill this responsibility.</p>
<p>As for the current situation, doctors are also raising their consultation fees to improve their livelihoods. There is no reason to criticize this. However, it should be remembered that patients are not necessarily wealthy, and their need for medicine is regardless of wealth. The high cost of consultations is clearly unaffordable for ordinary patients today. Those who are forced to be hospitalized will incur even greater costs: rooms, examinations, medicines, even cotton gauze, and all miscellaneous expenses are borne by the patients. Spending a thousand gold coins on an illness is almost commonplace. Fortunately, if the illness is cured, either the entire family property is mortgaged, or the family is laden with debt, causing the ruin of a middle-class family. Doctors are supposed to have compassion for their patients. Only those who deeply understand the suffering of patients can be called doctors. They should expand their compassionate vision, slightly reduce their own extravagance, open the door to convenience for patients in this time of national crisis, and adhere to the principle of mutual assistance among people. Shouldn't this be the case?</p>
<p>Improving healthcare cannot solely rely on the medical community. When one seeks help from the medical community, one is already ill, and no matter how affordable the medicine, there will still be expenses. Therefore, we hope that society as a whole will focus its efforts on maintaining health when one is not ill. Talking about healthcare is about nurturing life; those who are good at nurturing life will be healthier. The main points are: preventing disease before it occurs, one; recognizing disease before it manifests, two; treating disease in its early stages, three. Paying attention to these three points will not only benefit one's physical and economic health, but also benefit society. Societies in various countries have long had various healthcare organizations. Their methods and intentions have much to offer. The organization and its methods differ. The key is to combine collective strength to solve common concerns. Aim for economy, aim for convenience, aim to use regular minor burdens to cope with unexpected huge problems.</p>
<p>In addition, it is also hoped that society in general will pay attention to public health. Public health should be based on the self-help of the public and led by the government. If the public does not emphasize public welfare and hygiene, even good laws will be difficult to achieve effective results. As for what we expect from the government, it is complete and well-managed public medical and pharmaceutical facilities, proper selection of doctors, proper training of nurses, ensuring affordability for ordinary people, eliminating casual arrogance in attitudes, increasing the number of beds, and expanding the scope of prevention and treatment. All are important. In short, the government's spending should be effective, but also ensure that the public is happy to cooperate, and that patients are willing to trust. It should not be like a government office, a prison, or as rude as torture. If this is the case, government facilities will surely benefit from the cooperation of citizens and achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<h3>Germany's Memorandum to the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg – London Issues a Statement Strongly Refuting It</h3>
<p>Berlin – The German government today submitted a memorandum to the governments of Belgium and the Netherlands, the text of which is as follows: "The German government has long been aware of the primary objectives of the Anglo-French war policy and deeply understands that the strategy of Britain and France is to expand the theater of war and turn other countries into subordinate forces of Britain and France. The recent plan in Norway is a manifestation of this strategy. However, due to Germany's swift action, this plan was shattered. Germany has official documents to prove and announce this to the world. After their failure in Scandinavia, Britain and France immediately shifted their target and transferred their main battleships to the Mediterranean, concentrating them in Alexandria, thus making the Mediterranean the center of Anglo-French war propaganda. On the one hand, they want to cover up their failure in Scandinavia, and on the other hand, they want to use the Balkans as the second battlefield against Germany. In reality, the purpose of this transfer is a feint to the east while attacking in the west. Germany has long known that Britain and France have a plan to attack Germany's Ruhr region from the west, using the Netherlands and Belgium as a passage. Germany has already recognized and respected the integrity of Belgium and the Netherlands, but on the natural condition that the two countries adhere to absolute neutrality. Now, Belgium and the Netherlands have not complied with this condition. Although they appear to be neutral, they are actually aiding Germany's enemies. According to documents obtained by the German Ministry of the Interior on March 29 and reports obtained by the German High Command on May 4, the German government specifically presents the following facts: (1) Since the outbreak of the war, newspapers in Belgium and the Netherlands have adopted an anti-German attitude. Although the German government has repeatedly protested, it has not been corrected. In recent months, leaders of the two countries have openly expressed support for Britain and France. (2) The Netherlands and Belgium allow British secret agents to establish agencies in Belgian and Dutch territories, with the aim of inciting revolution in Germany. Senior members of the Belgian and Dutch General Staff have even supported the activities of this secret organization, far violating the basic obligations of neutrality. (3) The military measures taken by Belgium and the Netherlands are even more obvious and completely contradict all declarations of the two countries. (4) For example, Belgium has established defenses on the western border, but there are no fortifications on the Franco-Belgian border, indicating that the Belgian fortresses are entirely aimed at Germany. Germany has repeatedly protested, and Belgium has promised to cancel them, but has not fulfilled its promise. Until recently, it has actively strengthened its defensive fortifications bordering Germany. (5) The Dutch coast also allows British and other troops to enter freely. Since the outbreak of the war, British aircraft have flown into Germany from the Dutch border every day. The German government has repeatedly protested to the Dutch government, but the Dutch government has turned a blind eye and is completely tolerant. Therefore, Germany cannot but believe that the Dutch government is allowing the British Air Force to use Dutch territory as a base for military operations. (6) The concentration of troops in Belgium and the Netherlands even more clearly proves that it is entirely aimed at Germany. (7) When Belgium and the Netherlands concentrated troops on the German border, Germany did not deploy troops to Belgium and the Netherlands until Britain and France deployed a large army on the Franco-Belgian border, and Germany began to take countermeasures. (8) The German government now has documents showing that the British and French plan to attack Germany through Belgium and the Netherlands has reached an advanced stage. Belgian and Dutch airfields have been inspected by British and French officers, and all electrical teams and transportation vehicles are gathered on the Belgian and Dutch borders, with a great sense of preparing for action.</p>
<p>Based on the above facts, it is clear that the attack on Germany by Britain and France is imminent, and this attack will take the route through Belgium and the Netherlands to attack the Ruhr. Therefore, the German government has determined that Belgium and the Netherlands will not only allow Britain and France to pass through, but will also support the Allied countries in various ways. Germany is now in a struggle for survival and cannot sit idly by and watch Britain and France implement their plans. Therefore, it has issued an order to send German troops to Belgium and the Netherlands to protect the neutrality of Belgium and the Netherlands with all military force, but it declares that the German troops will never be enemies of the people of Belgium and the Netherlands. This incident is not what Germany hoped for, and the responsibility rests entirely with Britain and France and the governments of Belgium and the Netherlands, which tolerate the plans of Britain and France. The German government will not attack the two kingdoms of Belgium and the Netherlands and the integrity of their colonies. If the governments of Belgium and the Netherlands want to preserve their people at the last moment, please do not resist. If Belgium and the Netherlands insist on resisting, Germany will use all its strength to crush them, but the unavoidable bloodshed should be the sole responsibility of the Belgian and Dutch governments. May 9, 1940, Berlin.</p>
<p>Berlin – This morning, the German government sent a memorandum to the Luxembourg government, stating that Britain and France have decided to attack Germany through Belgium and the Netherlands, and that Belgium and the Netherlands are likely to help Britain and France attack Germany. Therefore, German troops have been ordered to go to Belgium and the Netherlands to protect the neutrality of the two countries. The German government has sent a copy of the memorandum to Belgium and the Netherlands. At the same time, the German government hopes that the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg will give serious consideration to the current situation so that the people of Luxembourg will not face any difficulties due to Germany's actions. The German government guarantees that Germany has no intention of interfering with or infringing upon the territorial integrity and political independence of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, either today or in the future. (Haitong Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>London – The British government has issued a statement refuting the German document accusing Belgium and the Netherlands of not maintaining neutrality, as follows: The British and French governments have now taken immediate steps to assist the Netherlands and Belgium by all means. Germany falsely accuses the Netherlands and Belgium of not maintaining neutrality in order to conceal its act of aggression. This kind of advice is completely fabricated. In fact, the strict adherence to neutrality by the Netherlands and Belgium has long been known to the world. The Allied countries have taken all possible measures to prepare for this accident and are now implementing it with great speed. (Reuters Telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>The U.S. Government Issues a Humanitarian Appeal – Requests Germany Not to Bomb Unfortified Cities</h3>
<p>Washington – The U.S. government has requested Germany not to bomb unfortified towns and cities. (Datou Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Washington – At the request of Belgium, the U.S. government today instructed its embassy in Germany to inform the German Foreign Ministry that Brussels is a free city and should not be garrisoned. This notification letter was sent by U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles to the German Foreign Ministry after German aircraft bombed the city. The reason is that the U.S. Ambassador to Germany, Grew, reported to the State Department today that German aircraft bombed Beijing, damaging houses near the U.S. Embassy, and that Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak requested him to inform the German side that Beijing is a free city. (United Press Telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>British and French Declaration Fulfills Obligation to Assist – Powerful Troops Enter Belgian Territory to Aid in Battle</h3>
<p>Paris – British Ambassador to Belgium, Sir Clerk, and French Ambassador to Belgium, Laroche, recently sent a declaration jointly issued by the two governments to Foreign Minister Spaak, stating that the Belgian government had previously requested the British and French governments to express their attitude on the matter of concluding an agreement to replace the Locarno Treaty. The British and French governments have been paying attention to this matter for several months. The Belgian government has also stated that it is determined to resist all kinds of aggression or the use of Belgian territory, sea, land, and air bases to invade other countries, and has formed a strong army to protect the country's territory and has provided guarantees, declaring that it will abide by the various obligations stipulated in the League of Nations Covenant. The British and French governments have taken note of all these points. Therefore, the British and French governments recognize that, from this day forward, the various obligations undertaken by the British government in accordance with the Locarno Treaty and the London Protocol of March 19, 1936 (i.e., the one used to reaffirm the Locarno Treaty) have been completely released. However, the ties accepted by Britain and France towards Belgium will still be maintained, and at the same time, it is agreed that all existing ties between the countries will not be hindered by this action.

<h3>German Foreign Minister Issues Declaration</h3>
<p>Decide to Preemptively Settle Accounts with Britain and France</p>
<p>Berlin – German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop issued the following declaration to domestic and foreign reporters: Gentlemen, after their failure in Scandinavia, Britain and France are now applying their tactics to the Mediterranean. Britain's true purpose is a feint to the east while attacking in the west, and they want to attack Germany's Ruhr region by passing through the territory of Belgium and the Netherlands. This strategy has long been known to the German government and has been carefully prepared for. In the past few days, reports have been received that British troops will land in the ports of Belgium and the Netherlands. Yesterday, Germany knew that Britain would send troops to land in Belgium and the Netherlands, and at the same time, both British and French troops would cross the Belgian border to attack Germany's Ruhr region. Führer Hitler did not want the Ruhr region, the center of German industry, to be attacked by Britain and France, so he sent troops to Belgium and the Netherlands to protect their neutrality. This criminal act of Britain and France has triggered Germany's actions. The aggressive actions of Britain and France are only to maintain the position of their leaders and to maintain the current condemned cabinet. The German government does not care what they are for. Today, the German army will respond to them in the language they understand and wants to settle accounts with their leaders. (Haitong Telegram, 10th)</p>

<h3>Outline of Sichuan Economic Construction Approved and Implemented by the Chairman</h3>
<p>Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) The main methods are: Land Survey: First, the whole province will be divided into several zones and land declarations will be handled in stages and completed within a time limit as a preliminary consolidation. Land surveys will be carried out in stages and zones from the 29th year onwards to achieve fundamental consolidation. 2. Agriculture and Forestry (including farmland irrigation and cooperation): The purpose of agricultural construction in this province is to increase food production and the production of commercial agricultural and livestock products. Although most of the soil in Sichuan Province is suitable for rice cultivation, consideration should also be given to local conditions to promote wheat, potatoes and other miscellaneous grains. As for commercial agricultural products, attention should be paid to cotton, tung oil, rapeseed, tea, sugarcane, silk, tobacco, medicinal materials and other products to increase their output and improve their quality. For livestock production, attention should be paid to epidemic prevention on the one hand, and to promoting production on the other, as well as promoting livestock product processing to increase the value of each unit of product. Forest construction should focus on three things: (1) protecting existing trees; (2) felling mature and usable trees according to scientific methods; and (3) cultivating new forests. Water conservancy and irrigation are of utmost importance to agriculture. Although Sichuan Province has a foundation for canals and weirs, it is still limited to local areas and has not been popularized. In the future, it is advisable to (1) promote canal and weir projects so that irrigation can be more widespread, and (2) promote water conservancy equipment so that areas where canals and weirs have not been built can also reduce the threat of drought. According to the investigation, the agriculture of this province in the 28th year has made considerable progress due to the advocacy and improvement of the provincial government. In terms of silk, improved silkworm breeds and mulberry seedlings have been promoted in 15 counties such as Jiangba, increasing farmers' income by more than 6 million yuan. In terms of cotton, improved cotton breeds have been promoted in the northern part of Sichuan, increasing farmers' income by more than 8 million yuan. In terms of food, improved or certified grain varieties have been promoted in 18 counties such as Mianyang and Santai, increasing farmers' income by more than 1 million yuan. In terms of livestock, improved pig breeds have been promoted and pig and cattle blood serums have been injected in places such as Santai and the Three Gorges, increasing farmers' income by more than 500,000 yuan. In terms of disease and insect prevention and control, prevention and control have been carried out in areas where rice, wheat, cotton, citrus, and mulberry trees are planted, increasing farmers' income by more than 5 million yuan. Combining the above-mentioned undertakings, the income of farmers has increased by a total of 20 million yuan. In addition to providing human and financial assistance to the above-mentioned work, the central government has also provided loans to farmers through central financial institutions amounting to more than 40 million yuan. This year, the central financial institutions have decided to handle 100 million yuan in agricultural loans throughout Sichuan, which will be allocated to cooperative credit, agricultural production, agricultural product supply and marketing, agricultural extension, and farmland irrigation. In the future, this province should strive to make sound adjustments in technology and organization to effectively cooperate with financial power, so as to achieve twice the result with half the effort and benefit farmers. 3. Industry and Mining: Industrial and mining undertakings are the focus of modern economic construction, and also the main points of this outline. However, the work is arduous, and it is difficult to see results in the short term without the joint efforts of the government and the people. Since the war of resistance, the central government has invested more than 30 million yuan in Sichuan to run steel, fuel, electricity for public utilities, and electricity to supply industrial power related to national defense. The assisted private enterprises include steel industry such as China Xingye Company, Yuxin Steel Plant, Xiehe Iron Smelting Plant, WeiYuan Mining Company, etc., chemical industry such as Yongli Chemical Company, Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant, paper industry such as Longzhang Paper Mill, Zhongyuan Paper Mill, Chuanjia Paper Mill, and Jialexingshu and other factories, match industry such as Hongji Match Factory, fuel industry such as Jiayang Coal Mine, Tianfu Coal Mine, Neijiang Zizhong Fuxing Alcohol Factory, machinery industry such as Hengshun Machine Factory, Shanghai Machine Factory, Shunchang Machine Factory, Yongli Iron Factory, etc., power industry such as Chongqing Power Company, Qiming Electric Light Company, etc., textile industry such as Yuhua, Yufeng, Qingfeng, Shashi, and other yarn factories, Southwest Flax Weaving Company, China Wool Weaving Company, with a total investment of more than 300 million yuan. The above-mentioned state-owned and private enterprises are only a part of the economic construction of Sichuan Province. In addition, there are many undertakings that can be developed and urgently need to be carried out. In addition to those related to defense that should be organized by the central government, this government should also strive to assist various private industrial and mining undertakings by means of investment loans or guaranteed principal and interest, so as to achieve the early completion of economic construction. 4. Transportation: Agriculture, industry and mining are the main body of construction, and transportation is its lifeblood. The rivers in Sichuan Province are crisscrossed, and have long been an important route for agricultural product transportation. However, they are sometimes narrow and difficult to navigate, or have dangerous shoals and gorges. Surveys should be carried out, and all those that are related to transportation and can be dredged should be investigated and clarified one by one, and construction should be carried out in order of urgency. As for land transportation, railways and highways are the main ones. Since the war of resistance, the central government has been carrying out transportation construction in Sichuan, such as the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the Xukun Railway, the Xunei Railway, the Baolu Railway, and the Yuqi Railway. In terms of highways, such as the Chengkang Road, the Lexi Road, the Hanyu Road, the Chuangan Road, and the Chuanzhong Road, etc., have either been started and completed within a time limit, or have been selected routes and are being surveyed. In terms of waterway construction, there are those that are being built, such as the Wujiang River and the Qijiang River, those that are being dredged, such as the Jialing River, the Fujiang River, and the Guanhe River, a tributary of the Jinsha River, and those that are being investigated, such as the Yongning River, the Chishui River, the Dadu River, and the main stream of the Jinsha River. The work in terms of transportation is concentrated on the construction of shallow-water vessels and wooden boats. In terms of telecommunications, in addition to the trunk lines connecting the provinces being laid by the central government, those that are purely within the province have been prepared for construction by the provincial government, and are expected to be completed within three years. However, during the war of resistance, the source of railway and ship materials and liquid fuel is difficult, and the provincial government should pay special attention to promoting board boat water transportation and livestock land transportation. 5. Trade: The effect of economic production is to improve quality and increase production, but it must be supplemented by a rational trade system before goods can flow smoothly. According to the investigation, most of the products of Sichuan Province belong to the industrial and mining industries and are sold domestically, while those belonging to the agricultural and livestock industries are partly sold domestically and partly exported. Exported goods should have a strict organization and effective methods of transportation and sales, and should establish close contacts with the central trade authorities, receive their assistance, or help them purchase, so that the goods can be exported as much as possible, without being滞留 in the inland or damaged in transit, so as to maintain the inherent international market and seek to open up new markets. Domestic goods should (1) maintain the free flow of inter-provincial and inter-county transactions; (2) strictly prohibit the malpractices of hoarding, speculation, and manipulation; and (3) maintain a direct and mutually beneficial relationship between producers and consumers, and eliminate the exploitation of middlemen. 6. Finance: Finance is the lifeblood of economic undertakings. In recent years, the central government has been working hard to complete the financial network in Sichuan Province. The provincial government should also have a sound provincial bank as the backbone of local financial institutions. In addition, in order to meet the needs of the vast rural areas, it should (1) promote cooperative banks as financial institutions owned, operated, and enjoyed by farmers themselves. The order of their establishment should be first county and then sparrow, so as to be fast from the bottom up and have a solid foundation; (2) promote agricultural warehouses to assist in the work of agricultural product storage and mortgage, and obtain the convenience of using production funds. According to the investigation, Sichuan Provincial Bank has not been perfect in the past due to insufficient capital. It should immediately increase its capital stock and improve its methods. Dozens of cooperative credit unions have been established by the central government in conjunction with the provincial government, which has not yet reached half of the province. The remaining counties that have not been established should be prepared as soon as possible and established one by one. After the county gold has been established in most cases and the organization is sound, then the expansion and development of the provincial gold bank will be expanded. Agricultural warehouses are established under the guidance of the central competent authority, with more than 100 locations throughout the province, with a capacity of more than 2 million shih. The provincial government should have an active policy to promote them universally on the established basis, so that all remote counties have warehouses, and then the effectiveness of agricultural warehouses can be fully utilized, and rural finance will become more sound. (7) Reclamation: Although Sichuan Province has a large area, the land is not fully utilized. According to the investigation, the rich deposits of forests, livestock and minerals in the province are mostly concentrated in the southeastern and western parts of Sichuan, bordering the border areas of Yunnan, Guizhou and Kang provinces. Moreover, the mountains are vertical and horizontal, transportation is inconvenient, and there are very few immigrants, so they are abandoned. It is estimated that the area of the three regions in the southeastern, southern and western parts of Sichuan is 132,400 square kilometers, and the average population density per square kilometer is only 882 people. Reclamation should be carried out as soon as possible to open up rich resources. (1) Survey the various parts of Sichuan Province to accurately know the area, climate, soil properties and natural reserves of the undeveloped areas as a preparation for reclamation. (2) Organize reclamation groups, which are guided and protected by the government and promoted by the people in cooperation, and carry out them in zones according to reasonable distribution. As for the public security guarantee, health facilities, loan lending and technical guidance of immigrants, they should be properly prepared in advance by the competent authorities of the provincial government. (8) Hygiene: Most people in Sichuan Province lack basic health knowledge, so infectious diseases often spread and the mortality rate is high. The loss of life and the consumption of physical strength are a major obstacle to economic construction. In order to remedy this, (1) hygiene institutes and clinics should be set up in counties and towns to complete the organization of basic-level health care work, focusing on spreading basic health knowledge and preventing and controlling local epidemics; (2) hygiene training institutes should be established to enrich the technology of their basic-level workers; (3) infectious disease hospitals should be established to study the prevention and control methods of infectious diseases and guide the epidemic prevention work of various hygiene institutes; (4) hygiene material research institutes should be established to study domestic raw materials to replace foreign medicines and study agricultural food to improve the nutrition of the people; (Ding) Funds and Funds: Construction funds can be divided into two categories: those used for undertakings without direct benefits are funds, and those used for undertakings with direct benefits are funds. The amount of funds is determined by the provincial government according to the needs of the facts, and a budget is established. The raising of funds is to be designated by the provincial government as a fund, and submitted to the central government for approval, and industrial bonds are issued for investment in the above eight undertakings. A considerable amount of funds should be listed in the provincial budget for guaranteed principal and interest of industrial and mining enterprises, agricultural improvement, industrial trials and tests, investigation and design, etc. If there are undertakings that are too large for the province's public and private sectors to undertake, it is advisable to consult with the central government for joint management. If they have already been undertaken by central government agencies, officials and people of this province should provide all kinds of assistance and establish close links so as to achieve everything in detail and receive great benefits.

<h3>Opposition Parties Refuse to Cooperate: British Government to be Reorganized Soon: Churchill Most Likely to Succeed as Prime Minister: France Prepares to Form a Unified Cabinet</h3>
<p>London, Reuters, Parliament Visit Chang said, British Prime Minister Chamberlain may issue a broadcast today to explain his position. Although the current war situation is very tense, and national affairs require him to remain in office temporarily, he does not want to hinder the reorganization of the cabinet for a long time. The National Assembly will be convened on May 14. Reuters has learned that Lloyd George may join Churchill's cabinet as a minister without portfolio. If the government needs to be reorganized immediately, the most likely procedure is to appoint Churchill to organize a war cabinet, while temporarily not changing the positions of the non-war cabinet. (10th Reuters telegram)</p>
<p>London, Reuters, Parliament Visit Chang said, there seem to be two solutions to the current political unrest in Britain: one is to temporarily not change the government structure while the current war situation is unclear; the other is that if the Labor Party Council decides today that there is no need to consult the Labor Party's general meeting on May 13, the Labor Party can cooperate with the new government, then the war cabinet under Churchill's leadership, including Labor Party and Liberal Party members, will be formed tonight. Liberal Party opposition leader Sinclair entered the Prime Minister's residence this morning and met with Chamberlain. Labor Party leaders Attlee and Colin Wu recently issued a declaration, roughly saying that in view of Hitler's recent aggression, the Labor Party deeply knows that in order to obtain the final victory, the government must be reorganized. On the one hand, it reiterated its determination to do its best to seek victory, and asked all party members to devote their efforts to this purpose, and unite firmly to respond to the current difficult situation and make the sacrifices that should be made. (10th Reuters telegram)</p>
<p>London, Reuters, Parliament Visit Chang learned that the political circles will have developments today as a result of the National Assembly debate, and Chamberlain's resignation is almost certain. Last night, people generally speculated that the successor to the Prime Minister would be Halifax or Churchill, or Lloyd George. However, because Halifax is a member of the House of Lords and other reasons, Churchill is most likely to be selected. The Labor Party's decision to join the cabinet rests with the Labor Party meeting, but it is believed that the Labor Party can accept positions in Churchill's government. (10th Reuters telegram)</p>
<p>London, last night, British Prime Minister Chamberlain invited Labor Party leaders Attlee and Greenwood to meet and asked whether they were prepared to join the reorganized government under his leadership, or were prepared to serve in the cabinet under the leadership of another Conservative Party member. It is heard that the Labor Party leaders have expressed the impossibility of serving under Chamberlain's leadership, and the Liberal Party opposition party also holds the same view. As for whether the Labor Party is willing to join a government composed of mixed parties under the leadership of others, this issue will be finally decided at the Labor Party Council meeting in Ban Dizi today. It can be seen from the form of questions asked by Chamberlain to the Labor Party leaders that he is willing to resign as Prime Minister, only to have a national unity government that satisfies all parties succeed him. Attlee and Greenwood entered the Prime Minister's residence and met with Chamberlain for 45 minutes. Foreign Secretary Halifax and Naval Secretary Churchill were present. Chamberlain does not intend to visit the British King today. (10th Reuters telegram)</p>
<p>Paris, after the expansion of the Western European war, Prime Minister Renault immediately contacted the responsible authorities, especially the leaders of the parties in the National Assembly. It is generally expected that the Prime Minister will immediately recruit leaders of the opposition parties to join the cabinet in order to form a unified national cabinet in order to meet the needs of the current situation.

<h3>Dutch and Belgian Houses of Representatives Meet: Decide to Defend Independence: Dutch Foreign Minister Refutes German Statement: Belgian Prime Minister Accuses Germany of Despising Treaties</h3>
<p>The Hague, Ivan Erson City Radio Station, recently released a message saying that the House of Representatives met at 1:00 pm, and the Speaker delivered a speech, protesting against "Germany's reckless invasion of the Netherlands, regardless of Dutch neutrality," and said that the Netherlands has decided to defend its independence with the greatest courage at any cost.

<p>Brussels, when the House of Representatives met today, Speaker Gaufral gave a speech in both Flemish and French languages before Prime Minister Pierlot spoke, roughly saying that Belgium has been invaded by enemy troops. This act of violence is another fact that Germany has broken its promise. "The difficulties that our country is encountering this time may be more serious than those in 1914, and the time may be longer than the previous European war, but our army has been prepared and decided to resist to the end. We are now waiting for the comrades of the last European war to come to help us. I believe that Britain and France will be able to give us assistance." In addition, Prime Minister Pierlot gave a speech in the House of Representatives, roughly saying, "Germany despised its signed treaties 25 years ago, and now it has relapsed. After the governments of the five countries asked Britain and France for help, each country immediately followed suit, which is gratifying. Our country is now fighting side by side with Britain and France, and at the same time sharing weal and woe with the Netherlands and Luxembourg. At this time, it is urgent for countries to unite with each other. Recalling that the late King Albert I led the nation to bravely resist during the previous European war, this is a model for all officials and people of our country. I hope that God will bless Belgium and its rights." (10th Havas telegram)</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Maintains an Independent Diplomatic Policy: To Avoid the War from Extending to Eastern Europe: Ready to Deal with Contingencies at Any Time</h3>
<p>Moscow, regarding the new ranks of senior Red Army officers, "Zhen Shi Bao" recently commented, "The Soviet government has decided to adopt an independent diplomatic policy for the benefit of the Soviet Socialist State, and backed by the strength of the Red Army and Navy. Because it is surrounded by capitalist countries, the Soviet state is constantly consolidating its armed forces to prevent the conspiracy of foreign enemies from being implemented. The purpose of the Soviet authorities setting up new ranks for Red Army personnel this time is to enhance their prestige and strengthen discipline. The Second Imperialist War is now gradually expanding outside our borders. The Soviet Union's peaceful diplomatic policy has won the support of the working masses all over the world.

<h3>Talks by Wan Fulin and Zou Zuohua</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The National Government recently issued an order appointing Wan Fulin, Zou Zuohua, Ma Zhanshan, and Miao Chengliu as chairmen of the four northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe. Ma and Miao, being far away in their defense areas, will take office there. Wan and Zou plan to be sworn in at the temporary capital in the near future. According to Wan Fulin, the central government's reorganization of the four northeastern provincial governments is an absolute rejection of all puppet organizations, and a further expression of determination to fight to the end and recover the Northeast for the compatriots in the occupied areas. He himself will only serve the party and the country effectively and strive to do his best under the leadership of the leader.</p>
<p>According to Zou Zuohua, he is a soldier whose duty is to obey orders. Now that the central government has entrusted him with a heavy responsibility, he should do his best to restore the lost territory, rescue the elders of his hometown from fire and water, and complete the great task of resisting and rebuilding. However, all plans are still subject to the central government and consultations with Chairmen Wan, Ma, and Miao on the current situation in the four provinces, in order to adapt to the current needs. What he will adhere to in the future is: (1) To obey the central government in everything. The location of the provincial government and the administrative organization are currently under strict planning by the government authorities. (2) To plan and expand the strength of the existing volunteer army in the Northeast, in order to give the Japanese a serious blow at all times, exhaust them, and once the opportunity matures, he believes that expelling the Japanese army will be as easy as turning one's hand over.

<h3>Chinese Army Encircles Nanchang, Already Advancing on Nanchang's Outskirts from Three Directions, Japanese Army Desperately Struggling on the Nanchang-Jiujiang Line</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondent - The Chinese army considers Jiangxi to be located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, especially Jiujiang, which is the throat of the Nanchang-Hankou water transport, which is extremely important for the military transportation and economy of central China. However, to recover Jiujiang and cut off the Japanese army's Yangtze River communication, it is essential to take Nanchang first. Therefore, the ×th War Zone is launching an offensive on Nanchang from three directions. The battle situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>East Bank of the Gan River</p>
<p>The ×× Army Group advanced north along the Fu River. After crossing the Fu River from Liangjiadu, they advanced like a hot knife through butter. The Japanese army north of Liangjiadu was extremely panicked. In addition to sending aircraft to bomb Liangjiadu, Wenjiaxun, Baihu Ridge, Jiangqian, and Luoxi in rotation to obstruct the Chinese army's advance, they also burned all the villages along the Gan-Zhe Railway, the Gan-Min Highway, the section from Liangjiadu to Xiangtang Shabutan, and the waterway to Wanshe. Even all the trees were forced to be cut down by the local residents. The purpose was to prevent the Chinese army from using them for cover and to completely wrap up all the residents so that they could not help the Chinese army. The Chinese army on this line has advanced to Wanshe, Shabutan, and Tangshugang. The Japanese army is building fortifications in Liantang and Qingyunbu to defend them, forming a stalemate.</p>
<p>West Bank of the Gan River</p>
<p>The Chinese army advanced toward Xinjian and Nanchang from Gaoan and Fengcheng. Outposts around Nanchang, such as Gaoyou and Dacheng, located on the Gan-Xiang and Gan-E routes, have been captured by the Chinese army one after another. The Wanshou Palace, 30 li from Nanchang City, is the highest point overlooking the Niuhang Station of the Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway. After several days and nights of bloody fighting by the Chinese army, the Wanshou Palace was completely occupied on the 23rd, and the Niuhang Station was attacked in the wake of the victory.</p>
<p>Northern Jiangxi</p>
<p>The Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway from Jiujiang to Nanchang has been repaired by the Japanese army and is the lifeline between Nanchang and Jiujiang. The Chinese army attacking this area is flanking the road from the south bank of the Xiu River, cutting off its traffic. After the Chinese army recovered Fengxin and Jing'an, they captured Anyi on the 21st, connecting with the Chinese armies in Ganzhou, Dacheng, and Wanshou Palace, forming a three-sided encirclement of the Japanese army in Nanchang. However, the Japanese army is still holding on to the Nanchang-Jiujiang line and struggling desperately. At the moment, in addition to intensifying the encirclement between the Gan River and the Fu River, the Chinese army is also intensifying its attack on Tujiapu and Zhanggongdu from Ganzhou to cut off the Japanese army's supply. In this way, Nanchang may fall without being attacked. (April 26)</p>
<h3>All Sectors in Hong Kong Raise Funds to Help Compatriots in Zhongshan, Preparing for a Large-Scale Charity Performance, Li Xuefang Coming South to Participate</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondent - People from all walks of life in Hong Kong have always generously donated to various relief efforts, which has long been recognized by the world. After the hometown of Premier Sun and the only transportation hub between Hong Kong, Macao, and the mainland, Zhongshan, fell again the month before, the disaster area was vast and there were many compatriots in need. Overseas Chinese in various ports at home and abroad have already raised huge sums of money and remitted them for disaster relief. The Shanghai Zhongshan Refugee Relief Association held a charity broadcast at the Xinxin Company radio station from the 20th to the 22nd of last month, and invited Yong'an Music Society to perform Cantonese opera at the Lanxin Theater from the 22nd to the 26th evenings and the 29th and 30th evenings, raising more than 90,000 yuan in national currency. However, the amount of money raised, converted into Hong Kong dollars, is not much, like a drop in the bucket. It is feared that it will not be of much help. Moreover, Hong Kong is closer to Zhongshan, and residents here will surely be more moved by the disasters in Zhongshan after hearing and seeing them. It is proposed to prepare for a large-scale Cantonese opera charity performance in Hong Kong to raise funds for disaster relief. It was reported that Mrs. Wei Li Xuefang, who was once famous throughout the country for her Cantonese opera and is now resting in Shanghai, agreed to return to Hong Kong to plead for the compatriots and reprise her role, starring in her masterpieces such as "Shi Lin Sacrificing the Pagoda," "Sunset Tears," "Daiyu Burying Flowers," and "Cao Dajia." The association sent committee member Chen Qihao back to Hong Kong a few days ago to prepare and discuss with Hong Kong's gentry and businessmen He Dong, He Disheng, Guo Quan, Cai Chang, Zheng Bozhao, Du Yuesheng, and Wang Xiaolai, who had personally inspected the disaster situation in Zhongshan, to set up an office at the Shui'an Company in Hong Kong, with Guo Quan, the general manager of the company, taking charge nearby and promoting everything. On the one hand, he negotiated with famous Hong Kong actors to join the filming, and on the other hand, he consulted with the owners of major theaters on the matter of borrowing theaters. All progress has been warmly supported by all parties and is progressing very smoothly. People from all walks of life in Hong Kong have heard about it and are more eager for this matter to be realized as soon as possible, so that they can both enjoy famous dramas and fulfill their wish to help the compatriots in need, and believe that since Ms. Li Xuefang intends to perform the famous drama "Daiyu Burying Flowers," there are many scenes for the protagonist Lin Daiyu, as well as other sisters in the Grand View Garden, Wang Fengjie, Xiren, Qingwen, Zijuan, and Madame Wang, so there are many roles needed. If Li Xuefang can take the welfare of the compatriots in need as a prerequisite and humbly recruit Suzhou Mei, Tan Yulan, and Butterfly Shadow, who have penetrated deep into the Marquis's mansion, to play the roles of Baochai, Qingwen, and Xiren, then the four beauties will be complete, and it will greatly enhance the drama. According to reports, Suzhou Mei and Li Xuefang once held the top position of Cantonese opera female actors, and there was a saying that they were Liang and Yu of the time. Tan Yulan and Butterfly Shadow are also rising stars. These four are fortunate enough to have married wealthy husbands and left the stage. Although Suzhou Mei is not from Zhongshan, since leaving the stage, she once put on makeup and went on stage to raise donations for national salvation, reaching 100,000 Hong Kong dollars. Her masterpiece "Peach Blossom Spring" is still a popular hit, and her box office power will definitely not be weak. Helping disaster victims and neighbors is her duty. As for Tan Yulan, whose hometown is Cuiwei, and Butterfly Shadow, whose hometown is Shiqi, their homes have been reduced to ruins by the war. They have an inescapable responsibility for their families and hometowns. This charity performance organized by the Zhongshan Refugee Relief Association is an excellent opportunity for them to roll up their sleeves and show their talents. Leading the group of beauties is not a task for ordinary people. I sincerely hope that Ms. Li Xuefang will take good care of it.</p>

<h3>Sino-French Institute of Technology is Undergoing Reorganization</h3>
<p>Two members from each Chinese and French Side</p>
<p>To be converted into a Technical School by the end of June</p>
<p>It is rumored that the National Sino-French Institute of Technology in this city has received an order from Chongqing to close the school and order all students to leave the school by June 3. The reason is said to be that the National Government's funding is insufficient and it is unwilling to maintain the school. According to the investigation of the Dazhong News Agency, the school continued to operate after the outbreak of the August 13 Shanghai War. When the National Army withdrew westward, the Chinese government continued to allocate funds to the school as usual. When the European War broke out last year, the Chinese and French authorities, in order to adapt to the needs of the times, had planned to suspend it. The French side, according to the contract signed by both parties (that is, if one party intends to suspend or make important changes, it must notify the other party one year in advance and obtain its consent), proposed to the Chinese authorities in Chongqing to continue the school for one year, until June 30 this year. The Chinese and French authorities believe that it is a pity to suspend this school, which has a long history of training industrial talents. With the consent of both parties, a reorganization committee of the National Sino-French Institute of Technology was organized to prepare for the reorganization of the school into a technical school to continue cultivating engineering talents. The members of the reorganization committee have been designated by both parties. The Chinese side is Mr. Mou and Mr. Mou, and the French side is also designated by the French Ambassador Gosi Mo as Gaobai Ai (Director of the Education Department of the French Concession) and Du Boai (Professor of Aurora University) as members. The two parties have held many meetings at the Education Department of the French Concession to engage in all necessary matters for ending the old school and establishing a new school. Currently, the president of the school is Mr. Nong Jun on the Chinese side and Mr. Xue Fan on the French side. Since the school has an international nature, all French opinions and administrative decision-making powers depend on the ambassador. However, if the French ambassador himself is not in Shanghai, the French Consul in Shanghai, Baodai Zhi, is responsible. He has not received any instructions from Chongqing recently.</p>
<h3>Shanghai University and Middle School Students' Friendship Association, Letter to Fellow Students in Shanghai (5)</h3>
<p>Dear Students, we believe that the above words are not contradictory at all. This is our most solemn expression. What we need is a calm mind. Please think about it, is now the time to use our reason to judge everything? We believe that students are passionate, loyal, and brave. In the process of fighting, students are also active members. We certainly need to strengthen our actions now, but do we not need an even stronger judgment to deal with the encirclement of this extremely bad environment? Not only our position</p>
<p>Must Be Adhered To</p>
<p>Our thinking must also be constantly corrected, and our actions must not be separated from our actual lives. In other words, we must strengthen our actions from our own current lives. Therefore, we advocate national salvation based on our own positions, using studying as a goal to lay the foundation for resisting the war, building the country, and reviving the nation.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Shanghai University and Middle School Students' Friendship Association is to implement the above propositions. Dear students, when we think of the hardships of the pioneers in creating the Republic of China, when we recall the spirit of the national students who united to save the country during the May Fourth Movement era, and when we think of the loyal and brave soldiers who are now fighting bloody battles on the front lines, what feelings arise in our conscience? We feel that there is no opportunity to serve the country now, but in fact, there are many opportunities to serve the country. Studying hard is serving the country, donating frugally is serving the country, opposing peace and compromise is serving the country, and having reasonable activities is serving the country. In short, as long as we are not passive, not decadent, and do not forget our roots,</p>
<p>It is Serving the Country</p>
<p>Today, we earnestly hope that the students of the whole city will build a new Great Wall in their hearts, recognize the goal, be down-to-earth, and let us work together under the banner of resisting the war and building the country, from individuals to the whole, and even the entire society, to strive for the construction of a free and equal new China. This is where the significance of our commemoration of the May Fourth is, and this is also the focus of our efforts. How much do we really want to encourage! (End)</p>
<h3>General Situation of Adult Education Implementation in Guizhou Province (7)</h3>
<p>(9) Conclusion</p>
<p>The implementation of the Adult Education Year is a meaningful task in the province's educational administration and wartime mobilization. After reviewing the implementation process, I sincerely hope to point out the problems encountered, the achievements gained, and the future direction of continuing education, in order to seek correction from the people of the country. (1) Difficulties Encountered In the process of implementing adult education, many problems were encountered. Although most of them could be solved at any time, there were still some problems that could not be completely overcome. The most important of these problems are:</p>
<p>(1) The Problem of Teachers To make more than two million adults who should be attending school universally educated within a year, a large number of teachers are naturally needed, but the supply of qualified teachers is in short supply. Although the method of short-term training has solved most of the number of teachers, the quality of teachers is difficult to improve uniformly due to the uneven quality of the trainees and the limited time.</p>
<p>(2) The Problem of Students Adult class students often have phenomena of absenteeism or unwillingness to learn due to life struggles, occupational mobility, and busy family affairs. Or, due to wartime conscription of migrant workers, clearing the fields, and evacuation, the implementation of formal adult education has been affected to a considerable extent.</p>
<p>(3) The Problem of Teaching Materials The number of teaching materials for adult classes is insufficient, and the content of the textbooks is not completely suitable. The wartime adult education textbooks (How the People Resist the War) compiled and printed by the province are also difficult to distribute on time due to wartime transportation relations. The collection of materials for the current affairs report course is particularly difficult in remote counties due to the slow delivery of information issued by the provincial government.</p>
<p>(4) The Problem of Supervision Although the provincial supervision of the Adult Education Year mobilized the supervisors and supervision commissioners of the Provincial Department of Education to serve as directors of supervision in various districts, and one to two adult education supervisors were added to each district, the vastness of the regions and the inconvenience of transportation made supervision difficult to be thorough. As for the county governments, in addition to mobilizing the staff of the Third Section to go out for supervision, they were also allowed to add several temporary staff members to be responsible for supervision work. However, due to the busy wartime administration, staff members at all levels below the county often could not concentrate on supervision work.</p>
<p>(2) Actual Achievements Although many difficult problems were encountered in the process of implementing the Adult Education Year, considerable achievements have been made in fact due to the concerted cooperation of adult education workers and all sectors of society. Here are a few of the most prominent examples: (Zi) Creating a Strong Educational Atmosphere Since the opening of the Adult Education Year, after the civil servants and intellectuals of the province made a warm publicity, and with the enthusiastic promotion of all sectors of society, the general out-of-school adults went to school. Soon, they deeply felt the need for knowledge and the excitement of reading. Most students requested to extend class time at the end of the term and were unwilling to return their textbooks. They would rather pay compensation for the price of the books so that they could engage in review during agricultural gaps. Excellent students even deliberately submitted blank papers in the final exam in order to gain the opportunity to continue their education. It can be seen that the Adult Education Year has indeed created a warm educational atmosphere.</p>
<p>(Chou) Universally Improving National Consciousness Improving national consciousness and stimulating patriotic enthusiasm were originally important tenets of the implementation of the Adult Education Year, and the gains are also quite significant. For example, adults entering school universally understand that Japanese warlords are China's only enemy, and understand the true meaning of the National Covenant and the Military-Civilian Cooperation Covenant. Whenever there are social activities, adult class students can make impassioned speeches and activities. This shows a glimpse of the improvement of national consciousness. (Shi) Giving Play to the Power of Mass Mobilization Out-of-school adults, after being educated for two months, deeply understand the great meaning of "those who have money give money, and those who have strength give strength," and are motivated by patriotic enthusiasm to make special efforts for wartime service work. For example, the third phase of adult classes in Binyang County launched a campaign to donate cloth shoes and military hats to the soldiers on the front lines. In terms of cloth shoes, there were as many as 15,000 pairs. An adult class in a township in Luchuan County donated 1,600 pairs of cloth shoes. An adult class in Beiliu County held a gold donation on "September 18," which amounted to more than 800 yuan. As for the actual achievements of adult classes in various counties in donating property and providing wartime services, they are too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>(Mao) Promoting Grassroots Construction Work Due to the popularity of adult education, the general public has a better understanding of government orders and is happy to follow them. This can be seen from the fact that the public's participation in village and street people's congresses is more enthusiastic than before, the general bad customs are gradually improving, and the rural public production movement is more active than before. As for women persuading their brothers and husbands to serve in the military, it is also often seen. The facts are sufficient to prove that the power of the Adult Education Year in promoting grassroots construction is becoming increasingly apparent.</p>
<p>(Chen) Enlightening Culturally Backward Counties The implementation of the Adult Education Year concentrated manpower and financial resources, especially in remote counties in the past, which were limited by objective conditions, culturally backward, and educationally withered. By this time, the general educational atmosphere permeated the entire province due to the handling of universal education. The border counties greatly opened up the atmosphere and enlightened the opportunity for cultural progress. (3) Future Prospects The implementation of the Adult Education Year concentrates manpower and financial resources to promote it, although it can meet the requirements of universal education, but the two months of teaching time is too short. In the future, we must devote ourselves to the deepening of education on this basis. Therefore, after the Adult Education Year, a revised implementation plan for adult education in the 29th year was specifically formulated, and continuing classes for adult education were set up, so that adults who have completed two months of adult education have the opportunity to continue their education.</p>

<h3>Finance: German Offensive on Holland and Belgium, Foreign Exchange Suddenly Tightens in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>In yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. The black market for British and American exchange rates had entered a state of fluctuation. In the morning session, China Bank and Hong Kong Electric came in to absorb supply, and foreign firms' oil and cotton settlements increased significantly. At that time, the supply and demand gradually became uneven and slowly softened. The shortest term was initially at 3 shillings 3.75, and the U.S. exchange rate only settled at 4.71875 yuan. The monthly term tightened to 4.5625 yuan. Fortunately, a certain American bank sold a considerable amount, and speculators continued to emerge, so the upward surge was slightly suppressed. The market suddenly turned loose at noon. In the afternoon, news broke that German troops had invaded Holland and Belgium, and that Brussels had fallen. This news ignited the upward surge, as exchange rates between the U.S. and Britain were expected to fall sharply again. As a result, the U.S. exchange rate softened sharply under the buying pressure from Sino-Japanese banks and Sassoon, ultimately ending at 3 shillings 4.375, U.S. dollars at 4.625 yuan, British tight at .03125, and U.S. tight at .1875. Trading was extremely active throughout the day, and sentiment was unsettled again.</p>
<p>Oil and Cotton Settlements Were Very Active</p>
<p>In the early morning, London long-term bonds and near-term bonds all rose by 1.25. New York silver remained flat, and London gold remained unchanged. The British exchange rate against the U.S. was unchanged, against Shanghai it rose by .0625, and against France it was unchanged. The U.S. exchange rate against Britain rose by 2.25 points, against Shanghai it rose by 1 jiao, and against France it rose by 1.25 points. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened with spot selling prices of 3 shillings 4.6875 for British gold and 4.8125 yuan for U.S. dollars, both unchanged compared to last night's closing prices. After the opening, Sassoon and others began to sell, and the market was quite flat. It is estimated that foreign banks sold May U.S. exchange rates at 6875. When HSBC announced its rates, there were no increases or decreases. The silver balancing tax increased by one yuan. After that, an upward surge began. China Bank and Hong Kong Electric both absorbed, and foreign firms' oil and cotton settlements also had strong demand. Therefore, the tightest spot rates for British and American exchange reached 4.71875 yuan, and British gold reached 3 shillings 3.75. At that time, the most transactions were for the May terms. It is estimated that China Bank entered the foreign bank market at 4.625 yuan, and Hong Kong Electric entered the foreign bank market at 4.625 to 59375 yuan. During this period, foreign firms absorbed spot U.S. dollars from foreign banks at 4.75 yuan, and May U.S. exchange rates were also at 4.5375 yuan. However, because speculators sold slightly, the market remained stable. Foreign banks bought May British gold from speculators at 3 shillings 40625, May U.S. exchange rates at 4.625 yuan, and opened June U.S. exchange rates at 4.375 yuan. By the time of the midday close, buying and selling had become scarce, and the situation showed a slight rebound. As a result, British gold ended at 3 shillings 4.375, U.S. dollars at 4.78125 yuan, May British gold at 3 shillings 3.75, and May U.S. dollars at 4.65625 yuan. Spot rates were .03125 higher than the morning opening for both British and American exchange rates.</p>
<p>Sassoon Turns from Seller to Buyer</p>
<p>The afternoon opened quietly. At that time, news suddenly broke that Germany and Holland had officially opened hostilities, and the European situation was expanding. People were panicked and bought heavily. China Bank, Sassoon, and Japanese banks all absorbed May U.S. dollars from foreign banks at 4.5625 to 53125 yuan. The trend was quite tight, and as a result, British gold closed at 3 shillings 4.375, U.S. dollars softened to 4.625 yuan, May British gold at 3 shillings 3.75, and May U.S. dollars at 4.53125 yuan. Compared to the previous night's closing prices, spot British exchange tightened .03125 and U.S. exchange rates shrank .1875, while May British and American exchange rates each softened .03125 to .15625.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Market Fluctuates</p>
<p>Hong Kong, May 10 (Friday) -- The exchange market opened flat this morning. British exchange spot and forward rates remained stable and unchanged. U.S. exchange spot rates softened .0625 to 20.75 yuan, and forward rates were not announced. Shanghai exchange spot rates rose 1 yuan to 426 yuan (yesterday's closing was 425 yuan). Japanese exchange spot rates also rose 1 yuan to 88.75 yuan. At 10:10 AM, U.S. exchange spot rates rebounded .0625 to 20.6875 yuan. At 11:00 AM, they were flat. Shanghai exchange spot rates continued to rise 3 yuan to 429 yuan. At 11:00 AM, they remained flat, and Shanghai exchange spot rates rose another 1 yuan to 430 yuan.

<h3>European War Expands, Gold Prices Rise Again - Raised to 7160 Yuan After Closing, Demand Exceeds Supply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the black market for spot gold in this city experienced an extraordinary surge, breaking through the 7,000 yuan mark. This was due to foreign news that the European war had expanded, that German troops had invaded Holland and Belgium, and that Brussels had reportedly fallen. It was predicted that U.S. and British exchange rates would plummet, and U.S. dollar exchange rates tightened dramatically. This news reignited the previously weakened sentiment. The market opened firm but stable at 6,860 yuan. Later, a low price of 6,855 yuan was seen. Then, news came that foreign exchange was tightening due to purchases by Hong Kong Electric and foreign firms, and gold and silver firms began to buy, launching an upward surge that soared above 6,900 yuan, reaching 6,955 yuan. Near noon, the market fell sharply by 95 yuan following the decline in exchange rates. In the afternoon, foreign news arrived, U.S. dollar exchange rates tightened sharply, and securities firms bought aggressively, with followers flocking in. As a result, in a situation of demand exceeding supply, the upward surge intensified, rising to a peak of 7,090 yuan at the close, a rebound of 211 yuan. After the close, U.S. dollar bills were unusually expensive, and spot gold followed the rise. Outside the market, prices continued to soar, rising to 7,160 yuan at 6:30 PM with demand exceeding supply. Total trading for the day was over 4,000 taels. Ornamental gold also soared by 20 yuan, reaching 720 yuan. Custom gold, etc., averaged the same.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Rises by 211 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, the initial sentiment was flat and tired, slightly down by 19 yuan, with gold firms selling 20 taels to silver firms at 6,860 yuan. Later, gold firms and silver firms bought, rebounding by 20 yuan. Silver firms sold 50 taels to silver building firms at 6,880 yuan. Then, money exchange firms suddenly began to sell, pushing the price down again. Money exchange firms sold 30 taels to gold firms at 6,855 yuan. Fortunately, silver firms returned to search for purchases, and the price rose again. Later, as foreign exchange suddenly reported tightness, buying momentum gradually expanded, and gold and silver firms competed to buy, immediately breaking through the 6,900 yuan mark. Silver firms traded 10 taels, rising to 6,955 yuan. Unexpectedly, the exchange market suddenly reported a rebound, and retail investors immediately sold at high prices, gradually stepping down the price, retreating to 6,900 yuan, sellers were more numerous, silver firms reversed the trend, dropping by 40 yuan, gold firms sold 10 taels to silver firms at 6,860 yuan, near the close, selling momentum slightly subsided, silver firms seeing low prices bought again, rebounding by 10 yuan, silver firms took in 20 taels from money exchange firms at 6,880 yuan as the midday closing price, In the afternoon, sentiment was quite good, and sellers were scarce.

Money exchange firms sold 10 taels to gold firms at 6,880 yuan. Then, news of positive European developments spread, gold firms aggressively raised prices, and retail investors also followed the trend and absorbed, and the exchange market reported softening, at one time there were very few sellers, immediately rising 205 yuan, silver firms traded 20 taels, reaching 7,085 yuan. At this time, a certain gold firm took profits, immediately dropping by 55 yuan, gold firms sold 20 taels to securities firms at 7,030 yuan, after entering, the shorts saw the situation and were anxious to cover their positions, silver firms searched even more, soaring again by 60 yuan, silver firms took in 20 taels from gold firms at 7,090 yuan as the evening closing price, as a result, it soared 211 yuan compared to the previous day, with a total of 235 yuan fluctuations, the cash gold firm's gold selling price was 10 yuan higher than the spot, The buy-back price was reduced by more than 20 yuan, and the current gold price was 50-60 yuan lower than the listed gold price.</p>
<p>Silver Store Ornamental Gold Listed at a High Premium</p>
<p>The initial price of ornamental gold per tael exchanged by silver stores was still 700 yuan for larger stores, but at 2:45 PM it was listed at a premium of 10 yuan, and at 3:05 PM it was another 10 yuan higher. As a result, the total premium was 20 yuan. It is estimated that larger stores changed the price to 720 yuan, and new stores had the same price. The buy-back price was reduced by 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Rise Sharply in the Evening</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw stable British and American gold pounds in the morning. In the afternoon, due to the German invasion of Holland and Belgium, gold prices rose sharply, so buying interest surged. As a result, all currencies rose by 5 yuan compared to the previous day. British gold bills rose in the morning and returned to flat in the afternoon. U.S. dollar bills fluctuated slightly firmer in the morning session, but the black market U.S. dollar exchange rate shrank significantly in the afternoon, reaching a high of 21.5 jiao in the evening, a sharp rise of 1 yuan compared to the previous day. There was some demand for Hong Kong bills, and market prices rose slightly. There was also strong demand for French franc bills and New Dutch, Annamite, ruble, Canadian, and Philippine bills, and market prices all rose uniformly. The supply and demand for Japanese gold bills and Korean bills were both balanced, and market prices remained stable. The former was 1.28 yuan, and the latter was 1 yuan.</p>
<h3>Discount and Call Loan Interest Rates Remain Flat</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for drafts and bills of exchange fell and then returned to flat. Initially, the rate per 1,000 yuan fell from 118 yuan to a low of 105 yuan in the morning, around 110 yuan at noon, and rose to 125 yuan in the afternoon. The final rate was 120 yuan, similar to the previous day's price. The Money Industry Association's call loan interest rate remained at 2.5 jiao in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>Securities: Foreign Stocks Fluctuate</h3>
<p>The black market for securities started firm and then weakened yesterday. The number of buyers in the market decreased sharply, and the situation of supply exceeding demand reappeared. Ultimately, due to a lack of counterparties, transactions were extremely scarce. Except for Class C shares, the market was quite deserted. Class D shares held their ninth lottery. Because the dividend for winning shares was reserved, they were uniquely higher, mostly by a small amount. This was because other types of shares had weakened, bringing them down. After the market closed, news of the German-Dutch war and Chamberlain's dismissal secretly pushed prices even lower, and the future was difficult to view with optimism. In the morning, Lianyi, Hongda, Le Mao, and Yitai opened with buying offers that were 1-2 jiao stronger than the previous day, but Tongshun and Hongkang sold in large quantities, and the price gradually declined. Although there were many sellers in the afternoon, there were very few buyers, so they mutually held back, and the market only differed by 5 cents. As a result, except for Class D shares, which were uniquely higher due to the lottery, the others were only about 1 jiao higher. Class E shares were slightly better at 1 jiao. The total transaction volume was only about 500,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category　Highest　Lowest　Closing　Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A　59.5　——　59.25　Down 0.05</p>
<p>Unified B　50.85　50.7　50.7　Down 0.15</p>
<p>Unified Domestic　48.85　48.55　48.60　Down 0.10</p>
<p>Unified D　47.60　——　47.60　Up 0.90</p>
<p>Unified E　49.60　49.40　49.45　Up 0.10</p>
<p>For stock trading, 50 shares of Guanshen Food Company stock were transacted at 40 yuan.</p>
<p>The stock market closed firmly. Those who were settling deals for the week rushed to sell, and prices fell as usual. The stocks that were most heavily traded at the beginning of the week fell the most at this time. British Union shares fell from 70 yuan to 67.5 yuan for buying and 68.5 yuan for selling at the close, with about 35,700 shares changing hands. International shares ranged from 38.5 yuan to 37.25 yuan, closing with buying offers at 37 yuan. Yangzi shares remained stable at 21 yuan until the close. Chinese Textiles shares opened with buying offers at 30.25 yuan, fell to a low of 28.25 yuan at one point, and closed with a rebound, priced at 28.5 yuan for buying and 29 yuan for selling.</p>
<p>Rubber stocks continued to soften slightly. The decline compared to the previous day's close was very limited, and some even rebounded, such as Langgezhi shares, which closed over 1 yuan higher than before. Given the prevailing situation, it is safe to say that the market will tend to improve next Monday. However, news came in the afternoon that German troops had invaded Holland, so it is difficult to make a prediction about the future market situation. Perhaps there will be a slight impact, or perhaps there will be no impact at all, only causing traders to hesitate.</p>
<p>London, May 9 (Thursday) -- Today, the listed prices of Chinese and foreign bonds remained flat, with no changes in the prices of various bonds.</p>
<p>London, May 9 (Thursday) -- Today, the listed prices of stocks of British Far East companies were generally stable. Only Gulak Lim Bang rubber shares fell 4.5 pence to 18 shillings 1.5 pence. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Dividend of Semag Rubber Canceled</h3>
<p>The British firm Huatong Foreign Firm, the agent for Semag Rubber Limited, resolved at a board meeting yesterday to distribute an interim dividend of 1 jiao per share in national currency on May 24 for the year ending September 1940. The interim dividend for this year will only be distributed once due to the Malayan government's foreign exchange controls.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth: Extreme Price Differences Due to Buying and Selling Short</h3>
<p>The yarn market is now fluctuating. After a big increase, it has begun to react and decline. But the market situation is extraordinarily chaotic and inconsistent. The prices of the same 20-count cotton yarn can differ by 100 to 150 yuan. This situation is entirely due to a lack of actual transactions and tight credit. The price of 20-count yarn for speculative purposes is unusually high, due to short selling.</p>
<p>Because of depressed sentiment and floating short positions selling off, the yarn market fell by 30 yuan in the morning, to 1,570 yuan. Then news came that British domestic customs was to be restructured, foreign exchange was reduced, and cash trended higher, and buyers were again active, rebounding to 1,615 yuan. Statistics on trade in the half-day came to 1,560 packages, with 10-count Biamah yarn rising by 8 yuan. Today, there are 1,335 pieces of cotton yarn to be shipped to Hong Kong, 125 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 25 pieces to Haikou, and 50 pieces to Haiphong. The amounts of yarn bought by various groups are listed below:</p>
<p>Qiaogang 380, Trading Houses 1,120</p>
<p>Ningbo 10, Total 1,560</p>
<p>In the afternoon, news broke that German troops had suddenly attacked Holland, and gold prices surged. Speculators were very active, and the yarn and cloth exchange was bustling. The price of a certain 20-count yarn suddenly rose by more than 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Spot Indian Cotton Transactions Particularly Active</h3>
<p>The volume of local cotton transactions was sparse. However, Indian cotton transactions developed exceptionally, and Indian cotton telegraphs were affected by the cloud of war in Europe, causing prices to decline, and sentiment was slightly restrained. The transaction situation for the spot cotton are listed below:</p>
<p>360.00</p>
<p>Mitterling 342.00 Trading house purchase 00 pieces</p>
<p>335.00</p>
<p>Pengjiapu 305.00 Again 300 pieces</p>
<p>Lower Sha packaging 286.00 Again 440 pieces</p>
<p>Middle India 280.00 Again 100 pieces</p>
<p>Xingheng 288.00 Again 200 pieces</p>
<p>The market price for foreign cotton. The New York cotton market was firm from the beginning. As the purchases of speculators and Wall Street increased, the market situation improved and shorts moved to cover, as a result, the continuous falling trend was halted and the cotton market rose eight to nine pounds. The Indian cotton market ultimately saw the European situation deteriorate and prices fell three rupees. Egyptian cotton rose eight to nine pounds.</p>
<p>Trading in Shanghai foreign cotton was impacted by news that Germany had invaded Holland and exchange rates tightened. Traders felt that the expansion of the war in Europe would increase the difficulty of transporting foreign cotton to China, and recent purchases by Tianjin traders saw available supplies fall. The retail prices were exceptionally profitable, and there was a general feeling that spot cotton would rise sharply. Below are the market prices converted to delivered prices at the factory at the exchange rate of $4.75.</p>
<p>20 Count US Middling 364.50</p>
<p>20 Count Again Lower Grade 321.10</p>
<p>32 Count Again 389.70</p>
<p>32 Count Again Lower Grade 374.50</p>
<p>42 Count Again 432.10</p>
<p>42 Count Again Lower Grade 380.10</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Resurgence of East Goods Stockpiling, Strong Increase in Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market for local cloth started weak and became firm in the afternoon. Real sales stagnated, merchants released stocks, and low prices appeared repeatedly. However, with the sudden rise in gold prices and market rumors of a critical situation in Germany and Holland, sentiment rose, and the market gradually rebounded. The final result was similar to the previous day. Due to the sharp drop in exchange rates, the Ningbo and Wenzhou traders added slightly to their orders. Transactions included over 100 pieces of fine cloth, bleached cloth, colored cloth, and coarse cloth. Guangdong traders ordered several hundred pieces of colored cloth and poplin and printed goods. Local dyeing factories ordered over 10,000 pieces of grey cloth and 5,000-6,000 pieces of poplin and colored cloth. Overseas locations such as Singapore ordered over 5,000 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, and bleached cloth.</p>
<p>Yesterday, with the rebound in gold prices, those with bullish sentiments for Eastern cloth resumed stockpiling, and the upward trend strengthened. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth rose another 3.5 yuan per piece compared to the previous day's market. The highest price for the Dragon Head spot warehouse receipt reached 53.8 yuan, and the closing price was 53.3 yuan. Four Gentlemen's serge closed at 1.525 yuan per yard. The price for the current month was 1.57 yuan. Retail sales remained clear, but traders from the north were bullish and collected 600-700 pieces of spot and forward fine cloth of various brands.</p>
<p>Exports: Today (the 11th), 487 pieces of cotton cloth are being shipped to Hong Kong, 250 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 29 pieces to Haimen, 982 pieces to Haiphong, 50 pieces to Yantai, and 380 pieces to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Demand for White Canvas Increases</h3>
<p>Yesterday's woolen fabric market remained strong. Sales of white canvas were quite smooth yesterday due to the increased demand from tailors making summer uniforms. The wholesale price for domestically produced Three Star wide-width white canvas is currently 2.6 yuan per yard, and narrow-width miscellaneous brands are 1.9 yuan. Non-Western goods from the Old Knife brand are 2.85 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grains: Glutinous Rice Suddenly Rises</h3>
<p>Speculators Are at it Again, Foreign Rice Follows and Also Rises</p>
<p>After consecutive declines in the rice market, domestic glutinous rice, in particular, was the cheapest. Common Danshao goods were selling for only 37-38 yuan, a difference of as much as 10 yuan compared to Gao Geng and Saigon rice. Under normal circumstances, even broken grains only suitable for making sugar would sell for 42-43 yuan. Therefore, how could no one consider this abnormal glutinous rice market? However, with attention focused on foreign rice, there was no time to look at this. Now that foreign rice is dull, attention is turned to domestic glutinous rice and actively purchased. The market is falling, and the usual quiet atmosphere is broken. The owners, already taking into account their own financial situations, were unwilling to sell lightly. Now they have an opportunity, and the selling price immediately rose by 2 yuan. Estimates for Jinzhou Special 42 yuan, 41.5 yuan, Changshu Danshao high quality 41 yuan, market average 40 yuan or less, and 39 yuan for lower quality.</p>
<p>The source of domestic rice, such as thick and thin Geng rice, has been disrupted, rumors outside the market say that generally the owners believe the weather is turning cold and there is no worry about the quality, and have a solid intention to defend their position, prices rebound 1 yuan, Wuxi Special Clear Geng rice selling for 50 yuan, Fenshao Geng rice 49 yuan, Changshu Geng rice 48-49 yuan, Suyu 46-47 yuan, Qingsi Extra Thin Gao rice 50 yuan, 49.5 yuan, general market 48-49 yuan, Nangan early rice 47-48 yuan, etc.</p>
<p>After the recent rush to dump, some stores cheaply resold foreign rice, so the early market had a tight supply. Then, clients from the countryside followed and bought. Although the regulations that restrict speculative transactions and insist on timely payment and delivery of goods have been newly implemented, the speculative fever inside and outside the industry has not abated, and it is not easy to return to the right track. And, a large new batch of foreign rice was pre-purchased by customers and are waiting to be transshipped to other ports. Both retail sales and hoarding are also active. Therefore, the asking prices have been increasing since the beginning of trading, and the midday close was already up 5-6 jiao. In the afternoon, rumors favored buyers, and the market rose again. For example, Xiao Jiao opened at 47.5 yuan and rose to 48 yuan in the morning and rose from 47.5 yuan to 48.3 yuan in the afternoon. Other spot rice all rebounded 2-3 jiao in the afternoon, Grade 2 Saigon original package spot 60 yuan, short supply of the upper period of May, the price rose from 60.06 yuan to 60.08 yuan, a gain of one yuan, but little was sold.</p>
<p>Also reported, there are more than 6,200 bags of foreign corn today, loaded on the Taikoo Company's Shuntian wheel and shipped to Weihaiwei, and 120 bags of foreign rice also shipped to Weihaiwei.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Eases</h3>
<p>The flour market has gradually eased. Both domestic and foreign transactions were inactive. After an initial impulse, Nan Yang sales had been in transit and customs procedures were slower. Local wholesale volumes were less than 5,000 sacks. While prices for Grade 2 flour remained unchanged, returned deliveries of old brand names have fallen over 1 jiao, down from an opening of 14.15 yuan to 14.1 yuan by the close and transactions were scattered. Other inland brands still sell for approximately 14.2 yuan. Buyers and sellers are currently holding back. 1,000 sacks of flour will ship to Yantai tomorrow (the 11th) and 2,000 to Tianjin.</p>
<p>Trading in both wheat and flour was sluggish with sellers and buyers holding back.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Oil Cakes Wavering Uncertainly</h3>
<p>Recently, the oil bean cake market has been sluggish due to both poor actual sales and a lack of new impetus, resulting in inconsistent interest. Over the past two days, the market first fell due to an oversupply, then rebounded due to positive external factors. Therefore, the overall situation is wavering and uncertain, with transactions scattered. Yesterday, only 170 barrels of Qingdao peanut oil were traded, priced at 110 yuan original price. A total of 220 barrels of Dalian bean oil were traded, with the price falling from 105.5 yuan to 105 yuan, then rising back to 106 yuan at the close. Tayou Factory oil was securely opened for 100 dan, priced at 86 yuan. Bean cake buyer groups were inactive, with only two cartloads of reduced-price Yuandong cake inquired about, priced at 10 yuan and 4 jiao. 1,000 pieces of Tongshen cake were priced at 10 yuan and 5 jiao. The market for soybeans is extremely narrow, with only over 600 packages of Wuhu beans purchased by oil presses, while Anqing beans and Dalian beans are entirely subject to listed prices.</p>
<p>In addition, yesterday 410 pieces and 350 cans of bean oil arrived from Yantai, and 510 cans arrived from Qingdao. Today (the 11th), there are 5,650 cans of raw oil and 420 packages of sesame seeds, all being shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Hoarding Dutch Sugar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was relatively soft in the morning. The association set the price of spot goods at 24 coarse white local firm small 5 jiao, at 75 yuan and 2 jiao. Foreign firm new goods were 74 yuan and 8 jiao to 75 yuan, small jiao to 4 jiao. Old goods remained at 75 yuan. Transit goods for delivery on May 20th were 99 yuan and a half. Taikoo refined white remained largely unchanged. Western firm B mark was 87 yuan, HX mark was 86 yuan, and the rest were lacking decline. However, at 2 p.m., news arrived from abroad that Germany and the Netherlands had gone to war, resulting in sellers disappearing and prices rising by varying amounts of three to four yuan. State firm quotations remained firm, with slight transactions and no fluctuations. According to Xinhua telegraph, Qing white sugar uniformly rose.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods High Price for New Toona Sinensis</h3>
<p>Since the new Toona sinensis appeared on the market, the opening price decline has already exceeded half. However, since the goods handled by the merchants were purchased earlier and costs are relatively high, the selling price has to be slightly raised. Yesterday's market price was 80 yuan, which is also 40 yuan lower than the initial price, and has temporarily stabilized.</p>

<h3>Why is a Husband's Energy Declining?</h3>
<p>— Co-authored by Dr. Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor of Sexually Transmitted Diseases</p>
<p>(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Intersection of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road</p>
<p>(Time) 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Closed on Sundays</p>
<p>One point of energy, one point of career, energy is especially the driving force of love!</p>
<p>In addition to managing household affairs, a wise wife must pay special attention to whether her husband's energy is healthy! Sometimes, if her husband's energy declines slightly, she will definitely comfort him tenderly and carefully study the reasons and methods to restore or even enhance his energy. Therefore, a wife's medical knowledge is also very important. From this point of view, if a husband truly loves his wife, he should start by loving his own energy. Indeed, the married life of a man with abundant energy and a beautiful woman must be very happy and sweet, with love , giving birth to sons and daughters, what a wonderful family this is! At the same time, encouraged by love, a man will inevitably become more courageous, thoughtful, and hardworking, which is so helpful to the progress of his career! Therefore, many men and women, after a happy marriage, embrace mutual love and assistance, working together with one heart, striving towards their bright and happy future, as if decades are like a day. When their descendants achieve fame and honor their ancestors, and the old couple celebrate their birthdays, may their parents be healthy and peaceful, what happiness!</p>
<p>Conversely, if a couple does not know how to cherish their energy, or has committed self-pollution and indulgence in their early years, damaging the endocrine fluid in their reproductive glands, then the man's energy will rapidly decline after marriage, leading to premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, spermatorrhea, infertility, neurasthenia, and other symptoms. However, women often experience an increase in their sexual needs after marriage, but the husband's energy declines, making coordination difficult in sexual life, causing love to be destroyed. In today's era, women who are sexually dissatisfied may commit adultery, elope, or even file for divorce with their husbands, which is countless!</p>
<p>In theory, if a husband's energy declines, he should make a decisive decision to restore and enhance it as soon as possible, but the wife should also find ways to remedy it. Fortunately, medicine is advanced today, and remedy is no longer difficult. However, it is essential not to take medicine randomly or seek medical treatment blindly. According to world-renowned doctors and our experience, taking a strong animal reproductive gland lysate "Reproductin" is the most effective treatment. This agent is based on the most advanced principle of supplementary therapy in modern medicine. It is refined by scientific concentration and replication from the endocrine essence of the reproductive glands of strong animals such as gorillas, tigers, wolves, bears, deer, and sea dogs, so the quality is pure and precious, the medicinal properties are mild and comprehensive, and the replenishing power is active and great, which is unmatched by any similar preparation. Therefore, men can generate sperm, replenish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, and activate blood circulation overnight after taking it. It is especially important to take it continuously, which will further promote development, nourish the nerves, and cure various symptoms in a short period of time, making energy more abundant, marital love happy, and middle-aged and elderly people who take it regularly will live longer, rejuvenate. However, those who suffer from seminal emission must also take the special medicine for seminal emission, "Hemitol Spermatostatic Tablets" (sold in major pharmacies such as Sino-Western Five Continents and the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company, two yuan per box) to stop the leakage, which will be more effective!</p>
<h3>The Crisis of Nocturnal Emission in Summer</h3>
<p>— Sexually Transmitted Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>Spring unknowingly sneaked back, and the seasons have reached summer! The temperature of the climate rises day by day. I think everyone has experienced the horror of hot summer! For a young man suffering from nocturnal emission, the crisis of summer is imminent! Because the seminal fluid in our human body, in physiological terms, is the so-called endocrine fluid in the reproductive glands, which functions to promote development, promote metabolism, nourish the brain, sex, bone marrow and other nerves. If you suffer from nocturnal emission and do not seek treatment, this source of life is likely to gradually dry up! Therefore, symptoms such as brain failure and forgetfulness, insomnia and palpitations, back pain, premature ejaculation and impotence, incomplete development, scattered energy, and premature aging will appear one after another. This kind of weak young man, once in the summer, the symptoms will inevitably worsen due to the hot climate. If he is a student in school, he will feel dizzy, brain swelling, tinnitus and blurred vision with a little brain use, and his academic performance will plummet. If he is a practitioner in the industrial and commercial sector, he will feel tired and unable to cope with a little labor. If he is in a love scene, he is often abandoned by women because of his yellow face, thin body and unpromising appearance. After marriage, it is even more difficult to obtain coordinated happiness in the couple's life, or even perform family tragedies such as elopement and divorce! The vast future is nothing but a dead end!</p>
<p>It is still not too late to treat nocturnal emission in early summer. At this time, if you take the special medicine for treating nocturnal emission, "Hemitol Spermatostatic Tablets" secretly made by Dr. Hemitol of Germany, you will be able to consolidate the seminal pass and calm the nerves after taking it, and you can receive the special effects of sleeping and stopping nocturnal emission that night. If you have had the above-mentioned symptoms due to a long history of nocturnal emission, you must also take the gonadotropin preparation "Reproductin" to cultivate the brain and kidneys, sperm and blood, and nerves. If you can take it continuously for a month without interruption, you will be able to cure various symptoms in a short period of time and make your body healthier. If patients can come to this clinic in person to report for new treatments such as electrotherapy and injections, cure can be guaranteed.</p>

<h3>The Defect of Deficient Breasts</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor—The Most Significant Effect in Early Summer</p>
<p>Everyone knows that women's concept of beauty is more intense. However, many women have simple minds! Their love of beauty completely disregards reality and blindly emphasizes decoration. You should know that if you are born not beautiful and have various defects, such as withered muscles, haggard appearance, thinness, especially flat breasts, even if you wear gorgeous new clothes in 1940, you will look like a walking dead. What touching beauty is there? Moreover, modern men look at women, often taking the beauty of curves as the standard, and the main conditions for forming the beauty of curves are a pair of towering breasts and full and swaying hips. If the development of these two cannot reach perfection, then there will be no curves at all, how can it be graceful and moving? How can it win men's favor? Therefore, women of this generation are often rejected by society and abandoned by their families, and as a result, their fate must be extremely tragic!</p>
<p>Then why are these women so unfortunate? According to the research results of world-renowned gynecologists Kang Delin, James Te, and French beauty expert Dr. Wei Niji, it is generally believed that they are all caused by self-binding breasts, insensitive leucorrhea, nutritional disorders, multiple difficult births, and severe illnesses, which lead to the destruction of ovarian function and affect metabolism. The only way to save it is to take the female "Reproductin," a reproductive gland ovarian endocrine preparation, which is the most effective treatment. This agent was invented by German medical saint Dr. Stanena after more than 30 years of arduous experiments. Its ingredients are purely made of fresh ovaries of young animals, supplemented with precious products such as phosphorus, calcium, and vitamins from minerals and plants, and refined under the most perfect scientific settings. Therefore, the medicinal properties are peaceful and the efficacy is accurate, and it can be taken regularly regardless of cold or heat. If you take it in the early summer of spring growth, it will be more effective. If you continue to take it, it will cure diseases if you have them and strengthen your body if you don't. Even if the breasts are as withered as a man, I believe that after three months, they will be more than two inches high, and at that time, you will be trembling with grace and your heart will be blooming.</p>
<p>Iron-Like Facts</p>
<p>(1) Nocturnal Emission Almost Ruined His Life Sexually Transmitted Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>Mr. Guo Yangzhi, from Xuzhou, is 21 years old and a boarder at a university in this city. Because of his intelligence, his academic performance has always been among the best. However, because he likes to read erotic novels, he has been moved to the point where he cannot restrain himself, and he has developed the bad habit of self-pollution. Due to the injury caused by self-pollution, his sexual nerves are weakened, his sperm pass is loose, and he has developed nocturnal emission. At first, it was only two or three times a month, then it increased to five or six times, or more than ten times. As a result, he felt his brain weakened, his memory was bad, he had insomnia at night, and he was absent-minded during the day. With a little labor, he felt back pain, his limbs were exhausted, and his schoolwork plummeted. He failed the exam last semester, which surprised his teachers and friends, and Mr. Guo himself felt inexplicable. However, Mr. Guo knew that his body was gradually weakening, so he bought and took so-called "nocturnal emission pills" on the market, but they were all ineffective, and his symptoms worsened. Just when he was worried, his friend Mr. Zhang introduced him to this clinic for diagnosis and treatment. After a detailed examination of his symptoms, he knew that it was indeed caused by the failure to treat nocturnal emission, so he ordered him to go to the Wuzhou Pharmacy to buy two boxes of "Hemitol Spermatostatic Tablets," a special medicine for treating nocturnal emission, and two dozen of "Reproductin," a tonic for the brain and kidneys, so that he could take them continuously, and apply new medical treatments such as electrotherapy and injections every other day. After more than a month, all his illnesses were suddenly cured, his brain was clear, his energy was strong, and he was an active young man again.</p>
<p>(2) Men with Premature Ejaculation and Impotence are Most Hated by Their Wives</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Feng, 25 years old, got married last year. On the wedding night, there was a sound of quarrel from the couple, so the couple's relationship was extremely bad and there was no happiness in the family. Mr. Lin suffers from premature ejaculation and impotence, and has never been able to exercise his marital rights after marriage, so his wife is still a virgin. How can she not be frustrated! Mr. Lin knew that if this continued, there would be many problems! So last month, he came to this clinic for diagnosis and treatment in person. After learning about his symptoms, he ordered him to buy three dozen of the male tonic "Reproductin." Because he had slight nocturnal emission, he also took a little "Hemitol Spermatostatic Tablets" and applied Die Men's electrotherapy every day. After more than a month of careful treatment, he felt that his sperm was strong and the love between the couple was overwhelming.</p>

<h3>Seven Robbers in Front of Jianghai Customs Attempted to Rob Over One Million in Tax Revenue Japanese Escort Was Shot Once by the Robbers Four Injuries Including a British Man from the China Press One Robber Shot and Captured All Other Robbers Escaped</h3>
<p>Inside the Jianghai Customs Building on the Bund, Fuzhou Road, a major robbery occurred at approximately 6:10 p.m. yesterday. Police and robbers fought fiercely on the spot, firing a total of seven or eight shots. The gunfire was as dense as raindrops. A total of six people were injured, including Westerners, Japanese, and passers-by, and a chauffeur. As a result, the tax revenue was not robbed. Details obtained through interviews are as follows.</p>
<p>Seven Robbers Blocked the Way</p>
<p>Since the Jianghai Customs tax revenue has been controlled by the Japanese, it has been customary for the Japanese Bank of Chosen to send personnel to the tax revenue office at the back door of the Customs every afternoon to transfer the daily tax revenue to the Bank of Chosen. Yesterday at approximately 6:10 p.m., a Japanese employee of the bank was preparing to transfer over one million yuan in cash, using a private car (Concession Permit No. 3886, Forged Permit No. 936), back to the bank. The money was loaded into the car, and as it drove out of the Jianghai Customs gate, suddenly seven robbers, three dressed in Chinese clothing and four dressed in Western clothing, blocked the way. Each took out a pistol, threatening to force the Japanese employee and the chauffeur out of the car. At this point, the chauffeur could not forcibly resist and was forced out of the car. The Japanese employee, however, was terrified and dared not leave the car. One of the robbers then fired a shot at the Japanese man. The bullet entered through the left side window of the car and hit him in the left arm.</p>
<p>Bullets Flying, Many Injured</p>
<p>At that time, two patrolmen at the Jianghai Customs gate, hearing the alarm, stepped forward and fired a shot at the robbers, but missed. A nearby Indian constable (No. 141) also rushed to the scene. The robbers, seeing the situation was not good, immediately opened fire to resist arrest, attempting to escape. For a time, the gunfire was as dense as raindrops, and the order was in chaos. Pedestrians fled in all directions. At this time, a silver car was parked by the roadside (Permit No. 18272). The driver, Qin Shengtin, from Pudong, 37 years old, two of the robbers jumped into the car, attempting to escape. But the driver firmly refused to drive. The robbers were helpless and had to get out of the car, taking out a pistol and firing two shots at Qin. One bullet hit his back, but did not penetrate. One bullet hit his left foot. A stray bullet hit the buttocks of Anlide, a British proofreader at the China Press. Before long, Indian Constable No. 141, who was pursuing the robbers, was shot in the right thigh by the robbers. Pedestrian Cao Huanxiang (34 years old) was also hit in the right shoulder by a stray bullet.</p>
<p>One Robber Captured, Other Robbers Escaped</p>
<p>After hearing the news, the Central Police Station immediately dispatched a large number of police officers in several police cars to surround the area on all sides, cut off traffic, and search for the robbers. At the same time, ambulances were urgently summoned to take the injured to hospitals for treatment. The Japanese man was sent to Fumin Hospital. The silver car chauffeur and pedestrian surnamed Cao were sent to Baolong Hospital. The Westerner Anlide was sent to Gongji Hospital. As for the robber Wen Guiqing (22 years old), who was shot twice and captured on the ground in front of the Continental Bank on Hankou Road, and the injured Indian Constable No. 141, they were both sent to the Patrolmen's Hospital on Shanhaiguan Road. It was also learned that the robber was shot twice, injuring his legs and right hand. The injuries were very serious and his life was in danger. The tax revenue was still intact and was not robbed. When reporters went to investigate the incident afterward, the Jianghai Customs gate was heavily guarded. Several Japanese military police were stationed nearby with guns, and the situation was extremely tense.</p>
<h3>Germany Invades the Netherlands News Reaches Shanghai The Statement from the Dutch Consulate The Dutch Authorities Decided to Resist to the End German Intelligence Officer Couldn't Justify Himself</h3>
<p>The expansion of the European war situation is an undeniable fact, and military secrets are especially variable and subtle. The reporter had just asked Mr. Coder, an intelligence officer at the German Embassy, at 6 p.m. the day before yesterday whether Germany had any intention of invading the Netherlands, citing the tense situation between Germany and the Netherlands. He replied that Germany had no need to invade the Netherlands. Unexpectedly,</p>
<p>The ink was barely dry,</p>
<p>German troops actually entered the Dutch border, and news of the bombing of the Dutch capital by air arrived in Shanghai. The reporter then went to ask Mr. Coder about this matter, hoping to get the truth. He seemed deeply surprised by the reporter's visit in a hurry, and only said, "Sorry, I can't talk about it. Please read our extra edition. The news can be found there," and left. So the reporter went to,</p>
<p>The Dutch Consulate</p>
<p>Met with Secretary Yhman and asked for his opinion on the German invasion of the Netherlands. He said that Germany's attack on the Netherlands was clearly aimed at using the Netherlands as an air force base to attack England and France, and to threaten the back of France. The Dutch authorities are determined to resist to the end and plan to open the sluices</p>
<p>To Flood the German Army</p>
<p>However, whether it can absolutely prevent the German army's advance depends on the effectiveness after implementation. As for the Dutch East Indies, the Dutch navy is also concentrated there, preparing to deal with all emergencies. However, it has not yet been mobilized. After receiving this news, the Dutch Bank in this city suddenly stopped exchanging currencies in the afternoon of yesterday. However, there was still an exchange market in the morning, at 8.75 yuan and 8.875 yuan. (Pingming Society)</p>
<p>The Dutch Consulate Received Telegraphs from its Home Country</p>
<p>According to another report, Mr. Bosafan, the Dutch Consul General in this city, claimed that the consulate had received a telegram from the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, confirming that the German army had invaded Dutch territory. However, Germany had not submitted any documents to the Netherlands beforehand. The telegram stated: "Germany did not submit any documents to the Netherlands, but suddenly invaded Dutch territory. The airfield has been bombed by the German side." According to the Dutch Consul General, the administrative situation of the Dutch in the Far East will not change in any way. He also believes that the Dutch transport company in the Far East will not be affected in any way, and will not change its route.</p>
<h3>Dongzhe Asphalt Transported to Shanghai Still Requires Exchange Settlement</h3>
<p>Dongzhe asphalt transported to Shanghai still requires exchange settlement. The previous rumor about the lifting of the ban is not accurate. Recently, the inland price is high, and the cost of arriving in Shanghai is over 110 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Conditions Proposed by Xiangtai Workers</h3>
<p>Transmitted to Capital by Detective Lin Compensation Already Paid for the Beaten Workmate</p>
<p>The labor strike at the British Xiangtai Timber Company. Because the arrested workmates were not released and the conditions for improving treatment urgently needed to be revised in order to submit them to the capital again, a meeting of all workmates was convened at 3 p.m. yesterday. The following</p>
<p>Six Conditions</p>
<p>Were resolved: (1) Ask the general manager, Collins, to negotiate with the court to release the arrested workmates Liang Shiji and others, and not to suspend their work; (2) For every stone of rice priced above 13 yuan, each person will receive a subsidy of five dou of white rice per month; (3) Those with daily wages of less than one yuan will have their wages increased by 10%, those with wages of one yuan or more will have their wages increased by 20%, and those with wages of two yuan or more will have their wages increased by 10%; (4) The factory shall allow each person to buy one yuan of firewood from the company every month, totaling 100 city catties (according to the factory, the broken firewood is contracted by Song Yougen and Wang Guisheng, who were injured in the labor strike, and the price sold to employees is 60 catties per yuan, and the price sold to workers is 30 catties per yuan); (5) Cancel the year-end bonus, and instead issue two months' wages at the end of the year; (6) The pension will be issued in advance at the end of this month; (7) Wages will be paid as usual during the strike period. After the above conditions were passed by all the workers, they will be conveyed to the capital by Detective Lin of the Central Police Station this morning, and they will be urged to reply as soon as possible so that the labor strike can be resolved as soon as possible. The factory's general manager, Collins, recognized that the worker Li Fengqi, who was tragically</p>
<p>Beaten to Death</p>
<p>Was very meritorious on weekdays. He expressed his condolences to the family of the deceased at the factory in the morning, and in addition to buying a first-class coffin and paying for the funeral, his wife was also allowed to collect the wages on behalf of the deceased and support her for the rest of her life. The education expenses of his eight-year-old daughter will also be provided by the hall.</p>
<h3>French Commercial Counselor to China Returns to Shanghai Praises the Progress of the Yunnan-Vietnam Transportation The Number of Freight Increases Tripled Progress Will Be Made in the Near Future</h3>
<p>Mr. Shelley, Commercial Counselor of the French Embassy in China, traveled to Chongqing and Kunming at the beginning of the year and lived in mainland China for three months. He recently returned to Shanghai. He expressed the following views on the transportation situation between Yunnan and Vietnam: The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is now an important export channel for China. The railway has recently increased its freight volume due to the surge in China's import and export trade. The freight volume has tripled compared to before, with more than 600 tons per day. To pass through the undulating single-track railway, this is actually a significant amount of transportation. A highway parallel to the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is currently being built. When this project is completed, transportation between China and France will be further improved, and the economic relations between the two countries will be strengthened.</p>
<h3>The Result of the Fluctuation of the Legal Tender Exchange Rate Was Beyond the Expectations of the Japanese Side The Value of Japanese Currency Followed a Terrible Decline The Japanese Domestic Economy Has Been Shaken The Tokyo Asia Development Board is Anxious</h3>
<p>According to Japanese sources, the Tokyo Asia Development Board held an emergency meeting the day before yesterday to discuss the Shanghai legal tender issue. As a result, no specific plan was found. However, it unanimously expressed anxiety about the following two matters. The Japanese side originally thought that after the legal tender exchange rate changed, the Japanese currency would definitely increase its purchasing power in China. However, the fact is just the opposite. The exchange rate between the Japanese yen and the legal tender is still the same as before the legal tender exchange rate changed (still one Japanese yen for more than 1.2 yuan of legal tender), and there is a trend of leveling off.</p>
<p>Japanese Influence</p>
<p>As a result, not only the purchase of cotton and other raw materials for industrial use, due to the fact that payment is pursued with legal tender, the Japanese yen's purchasing power in China is depreciated after being exchanged for legal tender. Even the military supplies that have always been purchased directly with Japanese currency do not show any signs of rising purchasing power. Especially the former will increase the cost of Japanese domestic products, stimulate prices, and further increase the number of goods exported. This is one of the points that the poets attending the Asia Development Board meeting are worried about.</p>
<p>Empty Funds</p>
<p>Secondly, some people in the Asia Development Board who built cars behind closed doors thought that the change in the legal tender exchange rate should be a good opportunity to promote the issuance of new "currency". However, Aoki Kazuo, who came to China with Abe and served as Abe's economic advisor, considering the tragic situation of the fake "Joint Reserve Currency," believed that the establishment of the fake "Central Bank" would not be successful without huge funds. The Japanese side must act cautiously. The people attending the Asia Development Board meeting were all stunned and speechless for a long time after listening to Aoki's opinions, which also shows their inner anxiety.</p>
<h3>British Women's Wartime Service Exhibition</h3>
<p>The British women of this city, with fervent patriotism, have been diligently serving their motherland since the outbreak of the European war. According to a reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency, the Shanghai British Women's Association has decided to hold a wartime women's service exhibition starting at 10:00 AM on the 23rd of this month. The location is said to be at the Association's clubhouse. Six months ago, the British Women's Association launched a knitting and sewing mobilization, sending all the products back to the motherland as donations to the soldiers fighting the war, achieving excellent results. Therefore, in this exhibition, the styles of knitted goods and clothing will be the most exciting part. All members of the British Association in this city are expected to visit and provide their valuable critiques.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Denies Salary Increase for Staff</h3>
<p>According to the Thames News, an important official of the Shanghai Municipal Council denied that the Council would soon announce a 20% or 25% increase in the salaries of all levels of staff. However, due to fluctuations in the black market exchange rate and the high cost of living, the issue of salary increases is likely to arise. The official also said that the appointment committee has not yet discussed the issue, and the proposal will only be submitted to the board of directors for approval when a decision has been made. He also denied that the Council would change the regulations for issuing pensions. Recent rumors claimed that the Shanghai Municipal Council staff, based on the length of their service, would be entitled to a total pension payout of [blank space] of the total amount. In reality, although there is a need for this, it has not yet been realized.</p>
<h3>(Note) (1) A Strange Person Indifferent to Rice Prices Soaring to 100 Yuan Per Dan (An)</h3>
<p>In the past, when rice prices rose to fourteen or fifteen yuan per dan, everyone complained it was too expensive. Now that rice prices have risen to forty or fifty yuan per dan, people have no choice but to accept it passively. This is the inevitable consequence of the times, forcing people to this point. However, there is still a type of person who remains indifferent even when rice prices soar to one hundred yuan per dan, as if it has nothing to do with them. They are neither millionaires who do not care about the price of rice, nor rice merchants who become more anxious as rice prices rise. Instead, they are people suffering from stomach ailments, often in pain, unable to eat much or eat anything. When they do eat, it's like counting pearls, picking at a few grains and considering it done. They leave banquets early and are excluded from group meals. Originally, food is the paramount necessity of the people, but now, with reduced appetite and insufficient nutrition, their physical strength declines and their muscles waste away. Is it not pitiful?</p>
<p>Five-Minute Stomach Pain Relief Powder, the fastest cure for stomach pain, eliminates the root cause most effectively. Each packet is two jiao, available everywhere.</p>
<p>People with stomach problems, if they can cure their ailments and eat well, will immediately feel that rice prices are too expensive, and it's not easy to live in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Price Stabilization Committee Should First Set Maximum Price Limits; French Concession's Price Stabilization Plan Announced; Citywide Salary-Earning Class Calls for Salary Increase</h3>
<p>The French Municipal Council's Committee on Fair Prices for Daily Necessities held a plenary meeting on May 9 in the French Municipal Council's meeting hall. Reports were submitted by the Rice and Grain Subcommittee, the Retail Subcommittee, and the Coal Subcommittee. After discussion, the following plans were adopted: (1) adopting measures to improve the situation in the rice and coal markets; (2) reorganizing the vegetable markets in the French Concession; (3) controlling bread prices. These plans have been submitted to the French Consul General for approval. Regarding the reorganization of the vegetable markets in the French Concession, according to a reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency, the authorities have decided to designate a portion of the Eight Immortals Bridge vegetable market for bidding by merchants to operate as a place for selling food items for foreigners.</p>
<p>Price Marking Should First Set Price Limits</p>
<p>With soaring prices in Shanghai, the concession authorities, recognizing the hardship of the people, have stipulated that businesses must mark their prices. This matter has not yet been fully implemented. Accountant Cao from the Shanghai Public Trust Office has recently proposed that the Shanghai Municipal Council first set maximum price limits for price-marked transactions to prevent price increases from being endless. Recently, the concession authorities, because the business of redeeming pawned items on behalf of customers in the market helps thieves to dispose of stolen goods, have banned it. They earnestly urge the Shanghai Municipal Council to take similar action against speculative trading in essential goods. If this is not done, the livelihood of the common people and the tranquility of society are at risk. Currently, the skyrocketing prices of various essential goods are all due to the machinations of speculators. Those who use the people's basic necessities as a means of getting rich are definitely not tolerated by society. The concession authorities, for the sake of maintaining public order, should strictly ban them. It is reported that the French Concession authorities have decided that all retail stores must mark the prices of their goods. (1) The price displays must be visible from the road. (2) Whether goods are displayed inside or outside the store, the price tags must indicate the unit and price in Arabic numerals, with the area of the numerals not less than three centimeters. The price marking measures will be implemented soon.</p>
<p>Unreasonable Coal and Flour Price Increases</p>
<p>The coal cinder market in this city has attracted much attention since it began pricing in US dollars. Although the industry has used euphemisms to cover it up, the reality is clear. According to a reporter from the Da Tong News Agency who inquired at the market yesterday, coal cinder prices are still marked in US dollars. However, due to the depreciation of the US exchange rate, the selling price has also decreased slightly in proportion. Yesterday, the selling price of coal balls was still eight yuan and forty cents per dan. Some knowledgeable people in the coal industry also believe that this coal cinder price increase is unreasonable and are working to lower it, so the market price will fall back to appease public anger. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, after receiving a letter from the Machine-Made Noodles Industry Association requesting that the price of flour be suppressed, immediately sent letters to the Fuxin and Fufeng companies to investigate. The current exchange rate reduction only affects the settlement price of newly ordered American wheat and does not affect the flour already produced and waiting to be sold. The members of the association are all small-scale businesses, and their business is also related to the people's essential food. Their urgent appeal has its reasons. The Chamber of Commerce believes that in these difficult times, all merchants should seek mutual assistance and have compassion for society. The association's request to authorities for strict prohibition, if everyone can be self-aware and self-governing, there is no need for this. Therefore, from the standpoint of merchants, we earnestly discuss with your company a method that takes both sides into consideration, hoping for a candid response.</p>
<p>Citywide Call for Salary Increases</p>
<p>Another report states that due to recent price increases of about 20% to 25%, there are widespread rumors that Shanghai Municipal Council employees will receive salary increases. A high-ranking official of the Council said that due to the sudden rise in the cost of living in the city after the dramatic changes in the exchange market, it is extremely difficult for salaried people to maintain their daily lives. Therefore, he believes that the issue of salary increases will enter a serious stage. However, the Council authorities have not yet discussed this issue. As for the issue of layoffs, he denied any changes in principle. Regarding the increase in pensions, the Council has not discussed it recently. However, based on the current situation, he admitted that although the Council's economic situation is not affluent, it is necessary to increase subsidies for all levels of staff whose income is based on the city's currency due to the increasing cost of living, especially for the general wage-earning class in the city. As a result, signs of unrest within the concession are becoming increasingly evident, as can be seen from the labor disputes in recent days. The labor unrest has not yet been resolved, and the Chinese Tin Foil Factory at 168 Shanhai Pass Road in the Public Concession, the Qianqiu Socks Factory at 45 Alley 195 Caishi Road in the French Concession, and a sock factory at 19 Alley 326 are all demanding wage increases due to the difficulty of maintaining a livelihood, as it is indeed difficult for workers to make a living.</p>
<p>Foreign Women Discuss Prices</p>
<p>A reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency has learned that the Joint Committee of Women's Groups in this city has decided to hold a lecture meeting on the 15th and 16th of this month at the French Club to make a detailed analysis of the livelihood issues of residents in this city. They will express their opinions from the perspective of women. To balance optimistic and pessimistic views, Mrs. Holbert's speech will be titled "The Situation in Shanghai Is Not as Deteriorating as Imagined." In addition, Mrs. Coder's piano solo, humorous talks provided by the American Women's Association, Mr. Stipper's sports speech, and Mr. Tang Xixue, editor of "Shop News,"'s analysis of Shanghai nightlife will be the most interesting programs. As for the more formal speeches, there will be Mrs. Bayer's "Shanghai Food Supply," Dr. Mao's "Low-Priced Nutrients," Miss Glance Young's "Fuel Issues," Miss Hyde's "Family Budget," and Miss Flock's "Inside Story of the Family Budget," etc. After the lecture meeting, the Joint Committee of Women's Groups will hold another meeting to decide on the steps and methods for rewarding the winners of this year's "Cleanliness and Hygiene" essay contest and awarding bonuses.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Closed for One Day on the 13th</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council and all its departments will be closed for one day on the 13th of this month (Monday).</p>
<h3>Rampant Actions of Fake Police; Arbitrary Detention of Chinese and Western Police Officers; Detained for More Than Four Hours Without Reason; Released After Police Station Sent Personnel to Negotiate</h3>
<p>Two Chinese and Western police officers from the Jing'an Temple Police Station were detained by the fake police in the "badlands" area of western Shanghai for four hours last night. A reporter learned the details as follows: Chief Inspector Gulobokov of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, along with a Chinese detective, went to a house near Avenue Road on Jessfield Road at 11 PM last night to investigate a case related to encroachment. Unexpectedly, several suspicious plainclothes Chinese men suddenly appeared at the house and obstructed the performance of duties by the concession police officers. After arguing for a while, Gulobokov and the Chinese detective went to a nearby fake police substation to report the incident. They were taken to the Shanghai West General Bureau of the fake police at 13 Jessfield Road and forcibly detained. After hearing the news, the Jing'an Temple Police Station immediately sent Chief Inspector Macfarlane to negotiate. It was not until 3:30 AM yesterday that the fake police station released Gulobokov and the Chinese detective, and a fake officer solemnly apologized to Chief Inspector Macfarlane. Major Bowen, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department, said yesterday that the matter would not be formally protested because the fake police station had apologized to the Chief Inspector. However, the Police Department will investigate the incident and then decide whether it is necessary to take other steps.</p>
<h3>A Westerner Returns to Shanghai and Talks About the European War and Far Eastern Commerce; Observations on Future Naval and Air Battles (Continued)</h3>
<p>A country that can control the ocean can attack any country, although it is not necessarily guaranteed victory, but if it can attack, it has a hope of victory. The British Navy is four times stronger than the German Navy. Britain has 2,079,863 tons, France has 815,000 tons, and Germany has 541,123 tons. Since the Battle of Jutland on May 31, 1916, when the German Navy was defeated by the British, it has not yet recovered. All they can use is submarines. Although submarines are very effective in sinking ships and killing people, the British have greatly improved their effectiveness by using destroyers to escort convoys. It is determined that the Great War cannot be won with submarines, and this time it is unlikely to be different. And Britain's naval blockade policy poses a great threat to Germany. Now, the losses suffered by both sides since the start of the war are listed below.</p>
<p>Germany (Pocket Battleships) Losses already confirmed include the Admiral Spee, unconfirmed include the Admiral Scheer, (Heavy Cruiser) Blücher, (Light Cruiser) Karlsruhe, and four others, (Destroyers) about twelve, (Submarines) no less than fifty or sixty.</p>
<p>Britain (Large Battleships) Loss of HMS Royal Oak, (Aircraft Carrier) HMS Courageous, (Light Cruisers) four, (Destroyers) ten, (Submarines) five.</p>
<p>If Germany wants to win, it must destroy the British Navy, but looking at the above record of naval losses on both sides in the past, the proportion of losses for Germany is six times heavier than for Britain. Currently under construction, Germany has four 35,000-ton giant battleships, two 19,250-ton aircraft carriers, five 10,000-ton heavy cruisers, four 8,000-ton light cruisers, and dozens of submarines of about 1,000 tons. On the British side, there are nine 35,000-ton to 40,000-ton giant battleships, six 23,000-ton aircraft carriers, twenty-three 5,450-ton to 8,000-ton light cruisers, sixteen 1,920-ton destroyers, four 2,650-ton mine-laying ships, and dozens of other auxiliary ships of various types. From this perspective, Britain's naval strength, which is four times stronger than Germany, can not only be maintained but also increased, because Britain's shipbuilding industry is developed, and the time required for construction is shorter than in Germany, thus increasing the rate of shipbuilding. So, since the German Navy is far inferior to the British, can it destroy the British Navy with its air force? I'm afraid there is little hope. Britain dares to fight Germany because they know that a blockade can bring Germany to its knees, and no matter what, the German Air Force cannot destroy the British Navy. The German Air Force is indeed stronger than the British and French. But under the conditions of well-maintained air defense equipment, the effect of bombing is not very great. The German Air Force flew 560 miles to bomb British naval bases, even bombing four times a day, and the results were minimal, with planes often shot down by anti-aircraft guns. Moreover, they have to be attacked along the way. As for the army, although Germany's military strength is relatively strong, it is not superior enough to start from the Maginot Line. Because the strength of the attacker must be at least three times greater than that of the defender. Time is on the side of the Allied forces. Britain and France do not want to attack Germany's Siegfried Line. Although Germany is in favor of a quick decision, it will not have any effect if it attacks from this side.</p>
<p>With the European war progressing in this way, large-scale naval and air battles are inevitable in the future. Although the German Air Force has a slight advantage, the results of air combat are not very effective, and the British Navy is so unbreakable. The outcome remains to be seen in the future!

<h3>Multiple Ships for Overseas Transport; Direct Route from Shanghai to Ningbo</h3>
<p>All Approved; Convenient for Travelers</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Ningbo liner route was previously blocked by the Zhenhai port closure, so ships could only anchor outside the port to load and unload goods and passengers, which was inconvenient for merchants and passengers. The company also suffered considerable losses due to delays in the shipping schedule. In mid-February of this year, the German firm Rulun Shipping</p>
<p>Gaodeng Ship</p>
<p>With a total tonnage of only over 500 tons, was specially permitted by the authorities to be the first to implement direct navigation to Ningbo, passing through the Zhenhai port blockade and docking directly at the north bank of the river. Later, the Italian firm Roche Shipping</p>
<p>Changde Ship</p>
<p>Represented by Jufeng Customs Brokerage, and the Hualun Shipping company's Ruitai Ship successively joined the direct route. The last time the Ruitai Ship returned to Shanghai, it entered the Wusongkou port, and at night, due to negligent navigation, it collided with a stone reef, damaging the ship's hull. It was then repaired at the Hefeng Shipyard. The work has now been completed. Yesterday at 2:00 PM, it left the dock and sailed to the Bund Garden Wharf on Beijing Road, scheduled to resume sailing today at 4:00 PM, directly to Ningbo. Previously, the Shanghai-Ningbo liner route ships, Haifu, Baoli, and Hana,</p>
<p>Sanshao Ship</p>
<p>Were also small and planned to participate in the direct route, but were not approved. Later, they changed to the Shanghai-Ou route instead. Now it is reported that the Shantai Ship of the Portuguese firm Far East Company, which is managed by the Zhengde Steamship Company, has been approved by the authorities and is scheduled to sail to Ningbo today at 4:00 PM, directly to the north bank of the river. Also, the German firm Lihe Shipping</p>
<p>Haifu Ship</p>
<p>After previously requesting direct navigation to Ningbo with the Baoli and Hana ships and being denied, changed to Wenzhou. It has also been approved to join the Shanghai-Ningbo direct route. The ship is currently still in Ou and is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Ou today, and resume sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo route next Tuesday (14th) at 4:00 PM, directly to the north bank of the river. The Tongyi Shipping company's</p>
<p>Jiangsu Ship</p>
<p>(Flying the British flag) has also been specially permitted by the authorities to join the Shanghai-Ningbo direct route. It is reported that the ship is now managed by the Daxin Shipping Company, and the date of the opening voyage is currently being planned. As for the issue of the Baoli and Hana ships joining the direct route, since the Haifu has been approved, the two ships also have hope. The number of direct route liners on the Shanghai-Ningbo line is gradually increasing, making travel more convenient.</p>
<h3>Wire Mesh Removed in Front of Longquan Garden on Nanjing Road</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department previously set up wire mesh frames in the Nanjing Road section of various alleys to maintain security within the concession, blocking them off. However, the businesses and residents in the alleys were greatly inconvenienced, and they petitioned the Municipal Council to remove them quickly. After the Council received the petitions, it sent personnel to conduct on-site surveys and investigations. As a result, it ordered the removal of the wire mesh frame in front of Longquan Garden (i.e., the east end of the Xindaxiang Building) on Nanjing Road and moved it back 20 meters to facilitate traffic. The residents of the alley unanimously praised the move.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Economic Committee Member Xi Yushu Discusses Shanghai's Price Issues; Speculation and Investment Are Different, With Different Safety and Dangers; To Maintain Public Morale, Salaries Must First Be Adjusted</h3>
<p>Xi Yushu, a member of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Economic Committee, recently made the following remarks: Shanghai's commodity prices are soaring, worse than ever before. The price increases by several percent up and down in a single day, indicating that it is not a sudden increase in intrinsic value but rather the result of hoarding and speculators competing for profits. If this trend is not curbed, the situation will deteriorate further. If we want to curb this terrifying situation, we must earnestly implement the following measures:</p>
<p>Curb the Rising Trend</p>
<p>Regarding curbing the rising trend, the current concession authorities have already established a method for marking selling prices. However, this method is ultimately passive for merchants who disregard the people's livelihood. Today, the price increase situation of businesses is endless, with two percent today and three percent tomorrow. If this unreasonable increase is allowed to continue freely, commodity prices throughout society will inevitably fluctuate, and the livelihood of the common people will become more difficult. Therefore, in order to curb the rising trend, it is necessary to further stipulate that if businesses need to raise prices due to increased costs, they must apply in advance and go through the approval procedures before they can raise prices. In this way, commodity price marking can be completely reasonable, and the rising trend can be curbed invisibly. Otherwise, relying solely on marking selling prices will allow businesses to change them freely, and the authorities will have no control over the drawbacks.</p>
<p>Discourage Speculation</p>
<p>Regarding discouraging speculation, society has already made moral appeals, but speculators continue to emerge one after another, as rampant as ever. However, extremes will inevitably beget their opposite, so we must be cautious. It is necessary to once again faithfully advise these heartless and sick people that Shanghai has become a state of abnormal development. There are many consumers and few producers. Speculating for profit can indeed bring wealth, but within tens of square miles, the rich will become richer, but they are ultimately a minority, and the poor will become poorer and increasingly numerous. The foundation of commerce is built on the consumption of the majority. If the majority of the people are turned into creatures waiting to die in a dry ditch, then the wealth of the rich will be transformed into frozen rocks, and at the same time, the enjoyment of their property will disappear, and the security of their property will not be guaranteed. Therefore, we must ask the speculators to wake up. Therefore, we hope that speculators should change their occupation to investors, nurturing and storing resources, and society will have a continuous vitality.</p>
<p>Adjust Salaries</p>
<p>Regarding adjusting salaries, it is even more important. Commodity prices are rising extremely, the currency is depreciating invisibly, and the general salary-earning class is suffering greatly. In the past, a monthly salary of fifty yuan was considered sufficient, but now, even one hundred yuan is not enough. Commodity prices rise while human value falls; this is a contradiction. As a result of continuous commodity price increases, capitalists greatly benefit, so they should also increase the salaries of their employees to ensure that they have the ability to maintain their livelihoods. It is unkind to be rich but not benevolent, which is truly undesirable. It is heard that various banks have stipulated that the increase in the commodity price index will be used as the ratio for subsidies in order to solve this problem. We hope that the authorities in various industries will also follow suit and implement this method so that the general standard of living can be rationalized, which will not only increase work efficiency but also stabilize social order.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Merchants Can Pay Income Tax in the Interior</h3>
<p>Avoid Exchange Fee Losses</p>
<p>The various trade associations in this city received a notice from the Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating that since Shanghai is an important commercial port in the country and has become like an isolated island since the National Army moved west for strategic reasons, the merchants of Shanghai are still actively paying various national taxes according to law, enriching the financial resources for the war of resistance and laying the foundation for the final victory. Their patriotic enthusiasm is commendable. However, according to reports from various parties, due to the current inconvenience of transportation, the proceeds from goods sold domestically by Shanghai merchants, or the net profits of branch stores set up in the interior, are mostly</p>
<p>Delayed in the interior and unable to be remitted to Shanghai on time. National taxes are indeed a legitimate levy, but the difficulties of merchants must also be considered. In 1939, Sichuan and Shanghai had agreed that Shanghai merchants could pay income tax in Chongqing, which was very convenient for Shanghai merchants. In order to consider the difficulties of merchants, this office has decided to expand the scope of application of this method of paying taxes. All income tax and profit tax payable by Shanghai merchants can be paid in any place in the interior based on practical convenience. Those who have branch stores in the interior should pay taxes in the interior uniformly.</p>
<p>National treasury revenue is originally consistent, but merchants can enjoy the convenience of tax payment and avoid exchange fee losses, which is very beneficial. This is to consider the difficulties of merchants and also to encourage their patriotic enthusiasm. We sincerely hope that Shanghai merchants will understand this intention. In addition to separate orders, this order is issued to inform your office and to forward it to the merchants in Shanghai, etc. Because this office previously received reports from Shanghai merchants that because they had branch stores or affiliated stores in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, it was difficult to remit funds, and the payable taxes were overdue,</p>
<p>In order to consider the difficulties of merchants, it was agreed to entrust the Chongqing and Kunming Central Banks to collect the taxes of this office on behalf of it. First, the Shanghai merchants would fill out the report forms and send the accompanying documents to this office for storage and verification, and apply to this office for a certificate letter, which would be sent to Chongqing or Kunming. The income tax payable would be sent to the local Central Bank for collection on behalf of it, and the receipt would be obtained and sent to Shanghai. Then, the number of the receipt and the date of receipt would be copied to this office for audit. It has been followed and merchants have found it convenient. Now that the scope of application of this method of paying taxes has been</p>
<p>Approved for expansion, in the future, if the income tax and excessive profit tax payable by the various industrial and commercial enterprises in this city are delayed in any place in the interior and are inconvenient to remit to Shanghai, they can first report the tax payment location to this office and submit the income or profit report form and supporting documents. This office will issue a certificate, which can be used to pay taxes to the Central Bank in that location, which is more convenient than before. This is a special letter to inform you, and I hope you will check and forward it to various industries.</p>
<h3>British Imperial Airways Company Resumes Hong Kong-Bangkok Air Route</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong-Bangkok air route operated by British Imperial Airways Company, which was previously suspended for some reason, has now resumed operations. According to news from the Post Office, the company has resumed flights to facilitate passenger and postal traffic between Hong Kong and Bangkok. Flights arrive in Hong Kong from Bangkok every Thursday and Sunday, and depart from Hong Kong to Bangkok every Wednesday and Saturday.</p>

<h3>Public Concession Police Crack Down on Opium Trafficking Syndicate: Large Quantity of Opium Seized from Customs Brokerage Firm; Geng Yu'en and Other Perpetrators Arrested Pending Investigation</h3>
<p>The Narcotics Division of the Public Concession Police, led by Detective Ye Yusi, Detectives Li Shugui and Liu Zhaonian, and Officers Zhao Baosheng and Guo Shouxin, received intelligence that opium was being trafficked in Room 252 of the Southern Hotel at 462 Jiujiang Road. They dispatched officers with 32 yuan in legal tender to purchase a small amount of opium. After verifying the authenticity of the substance, they immediately</p>
<p>Rushed to Make Arrests</p>
<p>Inside the room, they apprehended Gao Guodong and a woman named You Jianhua (24 years old, from Zhenjiang, residing at No. 2 Gaoshou Lane, Xinzha Road; manager of the Tao Tao Xiangdao Agency). They seized sixteen taels of opium. The 32 yuan used by the police to purchase the opium was also found on You's person. She was taken to the police station and confessed that a larger quantity of opium was hidden at the Renhexiang Customs Brokerage Firm, located at 293 Hankou Road, Room 221. Officers raided the location, arresting tea server Liu Hongfa and seizing 149 taels of opium. Investigations revealed that the opium belonged to Geng Yu'en (also known as Yu'en), who had</p>
<p>Brought it from Shandong to Shanghai</p>
<p>Police then proceeded to Room 236 of the Yingbin Hotel in Qinghe Lane, Zhejiang Road, where they apprehended Geng and Jin Zhuo'an, also known as Xiang Kongzhi. Subsequently, they proceeded to No. 56, Lane 336, Tiantong Road, where they apprehended Ji Luosheng, the main culprit and owner of Renhexiang. Several more taels of opium were seized. Yesterday morning, all the suspects were escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Special District Court, where police attorney Ru Baoyi charged them with opium trafficking under Articles 5 and 9 of the Opium Suppression Regulations, requesting that they be punished according to the law.</p>
<p>Geng Yu'en Confessed</p>
<p>That he had grown the opium himself in Shandong Province. Because it could not be sold in Shandong or Qingdao, he brought a portion to Shanghai for sale. Lacking a place to store it, he temporarily entrusted it to his old friend Ji Luosheng, and so on. Judge Feng Shide questioned the other defendants, then ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Child Trafficking Ring Detained for Investigation</h3>
<p>The Jiading Road Police Station recently cracked a large-scale child trafficking ring in the area of 355 Baoding Road, Hongkou. They apprehended ten suspects, including Ling Rongsen, Ling Zhangshi, Dai Lushi, Wang Lishi, Wang Wushi, Zhuge Qianshi, Lu Wenzhong, Zhuge Chun, Cui Tengshi, and Wang Zhangshi, both male and female. They also seized clothing, shoes, and hats taken from the trafficked children as evidence. Investigations revealed over a hundred cases. The suspects were handed over to the First Special District Court for prosecution. The court has already tried and sentenced the perpetrators to severe penalties and fines. Because the French Concession Police discovered that the suspects were also involved in multiple child trafficking cases within the French Concession, they requested that the Second Special District Court record the case. On a prior day, Detective Yan Jinwen was dispatched to transfer the suspects and the clothing evidence from the First Special District Court to the French Concession Police Station for detention. Yesterday, they were escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, where police attorney Chen Ming presented the case and requested that the defendants be detained pending further investigation next week to clarify the details of their crimes, before bringing them to trial. Judge Sun Pengxian briefly questioned the defendants and approved a postponement for further investigation. The defendants were returned to police custody pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Robbery Gang Targeting Women's Jewelry Busted</h3>
<p>Notorious robbers Zhang Lansheng (26 years old, from Suzhou) and Wei Xipeng (36 years old, from Jiangyin) have recently been targeting women's earrings, watches, and handbags outside bustling areas of the French Concession. On the 8th of this month, at noon, a British woman, Qin Sheng, was riding in a rickshaw carrying a handbag containing 250 Hong Kong dollars, five HSBC bank checks totaling over 4,000 yuan, as well as medals and badges. As the rickshaw passed the Dongxin Bridge intersection on Avenue Edward VII, Zhang and Wei suddenly robbed her and fled without a trace. The British woman reported the incident to the relevant McLand Police Station, which dispatched detectives to apprehend Zhang and Wei the other day and recover the stolen goods. The suspects confessed that the gang's headquarters were located at No. 88 Rue Cardinal Mercier. The police arrested nine accomplices: Wang Hongsheng, Wang A'ren, Gao Mingxiu, Zhang Weiyi, Zhao A'si, Zhou Gengsheng, and Zhuang Yuebo. They also seized a large quantity of stolen goods, including suitcases, soap, candles, towels, cigarettes, tin foil, clothing, watches, and earrings. Yesterday, all suspects were escorted to the Second Special District Court for investigation. Judge Miao presided over the hearing and ordered them remanded in custody pending further questioning.</p>
<h3>Presiding Judges of Civil and Criminal Divisions of the Third Branch of the High Court Receive Threatening Letters Accompanied by a Mauser Pistol Bullet; Both Courts on High Alert</h3>
<p>Since a prior day, the French Concession Jiangsu High Court Third Branch and Second Special District Local Court have been under increased security, with the French Concession Police adding detectives and joining with judicial police to conduct thorough checks on litigants, lawyers, and all persons entering and leaving. Details were previously reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the cause was a threatening letter received by Xia Quande, Presiding Judge of the Civil Division of the Jiangsu High Court Third Branch. Xia resides at a certain address on Avenue Paul Beau in the French Concession. On a prior morning, an unknown person delivered a [extremely] Western-style book to Xia's residence. Xia's family accepted it. That evening, when Xia returned home, he examined the book, puzzled as to the identity of the sender. He discovered a hole cut into the book, containing a threatening letter and a Mauser pistol bullet. Judge Xia reported the matter to the court, which requested the French Concession Police to provide increased security to prevent any unfortunate incidents. It has been learned that Wu Tingqi, Presiding Judge of the Criminal Division of the High Court Third Branch, also received a similar threatening letter this morning.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Telephone Line Removal</h3>
<p>Yu Chenglong, 22 years old, from Suzhou, residing at No. 3, Lane 339, Rue Bourgeat in the French Concession, recently retained lawyer Lin Qingchi to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court against Lin Xiangchen (41 years old), from Ningbo, currently residing at No. 14, Lane 109, Route Remi, seeking a declaration of his right to use the telephone. The plaintiff's complaint stated that the defendant had rented a three-story building from the plaintiff in June of the 27th year of the Republic [1938] and had a telephone, No. 77886, installed. At the end of November of the same year, the defendant vacated the premises. The telephone was then transferred to the plaintiff for continued use. The plaintiff paid a telephone deposit of 15 yuan and an installation fee of 10 yuan. Subsequently, the plaintiff paid the monthly telephone bills, as evidenced by receipts from the telephone company. Recently, due to the increasing number of telephone subscribers in the area and the limited number of telephone lines, leading to high demand, the defendant, seeking to profit from an opportunity to earn a large commission, wrote to the telephone company requesting the removal of the telephone, obstructing the plaintiff's use. The plaintiff, upon learning of the transfer, protested to the telephone company and raised an objection. Therefore, the plaintiff requests a legal mediation to declare the plaintiff's right to use telephone No. 77886. The court, based on the complaint, convened a hearing yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Chen Ziguan, summoning both parties for mediation. The plaintiff, accompanied by his lawyer, appeared in court and recounted the events. The defendant also appeared with lawyer Yang Sicheng, denying that any transfer had taken place. Since the parties could not reach an agreement, the court declared the mediation unsuccessful, and the plaintiff will file a formal lawsuit with the court.</p>
<h3>Taiyuan Kerosene Company Manager Embezzlement Case</h3>
<p>Wang Jingzhi and Wang Yifu, from Jiangbei, and Wang Jingzhi's son-in-law, Zhu Xiaofeng, jointly opened the Taiyuan Kerosene Company in Hai'an, Jiangbei, with Zhu serving as manager. Subsequently, they discovered that Zhu had embezzled a large sum of public funds, amounting to between 10,000 and 20,000 yuan. Wang hired a lawyer to report the case to the Laozao Police Station, which arrested Zhu and handed him over to the First Special District Court, charging him with embezzlement. Judge Feng Shide repeatedly investigated the case. Because the parties were related as father-in-law and son-in-law, he instructed them to first seek an out-of-court settlement regarding the ancillary civil lawsuit. If the defendant could find a way to repay the embezzled funds, his sentence might be reduced in the future. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng continued the hearing, but the civil lawsuit could not be settled. He instructed the police and the lawyers for both sides to present their arguments and concluded the hearing, awaiting judgment.</p>
<h3>Gambling Dens in Nanshi Attempting to Reopen After Closure</h3>
<p>Sanxin Gambling Den Opened Yesterday</p>
<p>According to a news agency, gambling dens were previously opened one after another in the Nanshi area. However, Father Rao, the head of the refugee area, strongly opposed them because they were harmful and would affect the order of the refugee area. A certain party then ordered them to be closed. Now, after more than a month, the gamblers are suddenly stirring again, trying every means to revive their business in order to make a profit. It is learned that the Sanxin Gambling Den on Minguo Road officially opened yesterday. However, because there are not many residents in Nanshi, and most of them are poor, there are few gamblers and business is slow.</p>
<h3>Defu Foreign Firm Indigo Theft Case: Three More Accomplices Apprehended</h3>
<p>In the case of the Defu Foreign Firm warehouse at 161 Sichuan Road, which lost indigo worth 26,849 yuan at the beginning of last month, the Central Police Station, acting on a tip, apprehended five suspects, including Zhou Mengqin, on the 7th of this month. They were handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation and pretrial detention. During a postponement, the police, based on the suspects' confessions, proceeded to No. 4 Shiyuli, Haifang Road, and apprehended Chen Heting and Jiang Yongling, two clerks in the Defu Foreign Firm's lending department (suspected of carrying out the theft). Chen then led the police to the Yongyu Paint Store at No. 305 Chengdu Road, where they apprehended Chen Kaichao, suspected of receiving stolen goods. Yesterday morning, all suspects were handed over to the First Special District Court. Judge Feng ordered them to be remanded in custody, awaiting a joint trial with Zhou Mengqin on the 17th of this month.</p>
<h3>Japanese Authorities Order Closure of Shanghai West Opium Dens</h3>
<p>Effective Date: End of This Month (31st)</p>
<p>Following the closure of gambling dens in the Caojiadu area of Shanghai West, it is now reported that the Japanese authorities have decided to order the closure of all opium dens in the area by the end of this month as well. The unemployed hoodlums who depend on them for a living have been actively plotting a new plan. They are now trying to open new establishments in the Nanshi area. However, after moving to Nanshi, they will have to be renamed "Sales Outlets." Smokers will also have to purchase "Smoking Permits" in order to smoke openly, otherwise they will be arrested.</p>
<h3>Local News Briefs</h3>
<p>Since the completion of the new Shanghai Savior Church on Zhao Zhu Jiao Road in the French Concession, over five hundred male and female parishioners have been attending services every Sunday. This Sunday, the 12th, at 10:00 AM, the church will host a lecture by the newly appointed Yunnan-Guizhou Bishop Zhu Youyu, with special music. Those wishing to hear Dr. Zhu's discourse are welcome to attend the service.</p>
<p>Famous painter He Tianjian, whose previous residence was subjected to rent increase by a secondary landlord and unwilling to continue living there, recently moved to No. 1283 Avenue Foch.</p>
<p>Over the past month, prices in Shanghai have skyrocketed, especially for clothing. Yesterday, the Jiucheng Trading Company of this port on Sichuan Road, entrusted by a major merchant, offered a large quantity of its accumulated domestic silk at a low price, selling each bolt for only about 40 yuan.</p>
<h3>Publishing News Briefs</h3>
<p>The 33rd issue of Volume 1 of the Sino-American Weekly was published this morning, featuring many specialized articles such as "The Theoretical Basis of Moral Resistance and Construction" and "The Problem of Stabilizing Shanghai Prices," with extraordinary content.</p>
<p>Li Wei-xin's "Li's Social English," written by the Principal of Shanghai Yingzhuan School, has been reprinted and is still selling for one yuan in national currency. General distribution address: 34 Rue Brenier de Montmorand.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's meteorological report at 4:30 PM yesterday stated: Sunny and foggy conditions around Shandong, with southeast to southwest winds. Cloudy and rainy conditions in this port and the East China Sea, with northeast to southeast winds. The highest temperature was 64.4 degrees Fahrenheit and the lowest was 57.9 degrees Fahrenheit. On the same day last year, the highest temperature was 89.2 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<h3>A Clever Method of Swindling</h3>
<p>Outside the capital city of Beijing, there is a temple called the White Cloud Temple. Inside the temple, there is a bridge. Every day, on both sides of the bridge's approach, two Taoist priests sit facing each other, each with a large paper money offering in front of them. As tourists pass by, each takes out a single coin from their purses and throws it from a distance. Those who can throw the coin into the hole in the paper money are said to be blessed, so many try their luck. In reality, the two Taoist priests are merely using this as a pretext to deceive people. Regardless of whether the coin lands in the hole or not, the priests collect all the money. When the weather is clear and there are many tourists, they can earn several thousand coins each day. This has been going on for a long time, and those familiar with Beijing are accustomed to it, so it is nothing unusual. Yesterday, a wealthy man visited Beijing for the first time and, finding it novel, threw several dozen coins, occasionally hitting the target, but mostly missing. The priests collected all the money. The wealthy man mentioned this during a dinner conversation, so I record it here to add to the amusement.</p>
<h3>A Thief Leaves Behind a Lantern</h3>
<p>A certain commissioner of the Hanguan gate in Suzhou was away from home on official business for the night. That evening, a hole was dug in the wall of the commissioner's bedroom, and silver, clothing, and other items were stolen. The county magistrate was notified and inspected the scene. It was discovered that the thief had left behind a lantern with the characters "Shuiguan" [Water Gate] on it. The county magistrate filed the lantern as evidence and ordered a strict investigation. The Hanguan and Shuiguan gates each have their own patrols, originally for the sake of preventing petty thieves. Yet the Hanguan gate was robbed, and the thief's lantern had the words "Shuiguan" on it, which people found quite curious.</p>

<h3>Mothers and the Cross (1)</h3>
<p>Women have their weaknesses, but they also have their strengths. For thousands of years, China has valued men over women, failing to acknowledge the position of women in the family and the nation. This is one of the reasons for China's weakness. Now we are actively promoting the strengths of women and raising the status of women. The reason I have chosen this topic for discussion is for this very reason. The cross is a symbol of sacrifice, a symbol of love. A mother's duties are also a work of sacrifice and love. Christ is the center of the Church, and the mother is the center of the family. Jesus' mother saw something different from what others saw when she stood next to the cross. Others saw only a tragedy, but she saw what love truly is and reflected on what her own love was like. Jesus, looking down at his mother from the cross, saw that she did not weep and also showed an undying love. Mothers and the cross can be spoken of together, with the following similarities: (1) "Mother" implies individual justice. I remember someone said, "God cannot be everywhere, so he created mothers for the world." This statement may seem somewhat naive on the surface, but in essence, it says that God is in "Mother." Where there is no knowledge of God or understanding of theology, God always speaks to people through the love of "Mother." A mother's duties are to show people the meaning of Jesus' forgiveness of sins and suffering on the cross. Before a child has a concept of God, he recognizes his mother. He sees his mother's personality as only slightly inferior to that of an angel. If a mother does not meet the child's ideal, this is the starting point of danger for the child. The main purpose of family education is to maintain this standard and make the mother the person in the child's ideal. (To be continued) For detailed study, please send a letter to P.O. Box 1227.</p>

<h3>Roosevelt's Bodyguard</h3>
<p>— Li Shaozhong</p>
<p>There is a man in America whose small photograph often appears in newspapers, but his name is never published. This mysterious figure is none other than the most trusted bodyguard of U.S. President Roosevelt. Whenever President Roosevelt appears in public, this mysterious person never leaves Roosevelt's side, staying within a few feet of him.</p>
<p>This confidant bodyguard of President Roosevelt is named Thomas Qualters. He has curly hair and blue eyes. He is Irish and used to be a policeman in Boston. When President Roosevelt stands to sing the national anthem, he always holds onto Qualters' arm with one hand (see photo). Every time Roosevelt is in a car slowly driving through a busy city, Qualters is always standing on the running board of the car. In the reception room of the Presidential Office in Washington, D.C., there is a broad-shouldered young man with bulging trouser pockets, often pacing peacefully, as if wandering aimlessly. That is Qualters.</p>
<p>Qualters' official title is the protector of the president's life. Protecting the president's life is the collective work of the entire "Secret Service," but Qualters has private responsibility. He accompanies the president to the office in the morning and follows the president back to the White House at night.</p>
<p>Usually, Qualters wears a uniform made of thick wool. But when the president holds diplomatic tea parties, you can see Qualters wearing a beautiful and elegant tailcoat, with a white bow tie, standing a few steps away from the president. If any inexperienced foreign high-ranking diplomats at the diplomatic tea party carelessly put their hands in their pockets or cross their arms and walk close to the president, Qualters will immediately follow them, tapping the diplomat on the shoulder with his finger in a very restrained manner, telling him to put his hands down.</p>
<p>Qualters is known for his agility in the White House. Once, when the president's car was driving through a city street, a passerby waving a shoeshine cloth rushed towards the president's car. Of course, the cloth would make people suspect that he was holding a weapon from a distance. Qualters immediately jumped off the running board of the car, ran forward a few steps, and, using a feint, knocked the man into a roadside ditch. Later investigations revealed that this person was originally a boxing champion. Qualters explained to people: "People often become very hurried when they want to run close to the president's car, which is really a very bad mistake. We "know their faces but not their hearts" for everyone, so we don't know their motives for wanting to run close to the president. Since the establishment of the American "Secret Service" in 1902, the protection of the president's life has never failed. We certainly hope to maintain this honor."</p>

<h3>The Great Undertaking of the Chinese Nation</h3>
<p>— Pin Pin</p>
<p>I was deeply moved, as if struck by a great stimulus, when I happened to read the chapter on China in "A Philosopher's Travel Diary" by Estonian writer Kai Ki-se-ling. Like Bertrand Russell of England, Kai places great hope in our country, believing that China can accomplish earth-shattering feats, which is far superior to the apathy of our general populace.</p>
<p>When natives discuss their own country's affairs, it's either lamenting and hating its shortcomings, or boastful and arrogant, rarely able to offer objective, fair, and calm analyses, like foreigners do, even though they inevitably have some distance and unfamiliarity. Kai's research on China certainly stems from some "curiosity," but most of it contains profound and unique insights. The most outstanding aspect is that she possesses a comprehensive concept that encompasses everything. We can use this concept to understand the various changes and facts of our country, and it is very accurate.</p>
<p>For example, in Kai's expectations, we see this sentence: "The nature of the Chinese people, on one hand, represents a rest in the development of a past era, and on the other hand, it is clearly a harbinger of future ideals." This is an extremely accurate conclusion. China has a heavy past, upon which our entire achievements are engraved, and at the same time, our entire failures are also engraved. We should let the failures rest, that is to say, not repeat the same mistakes; however, we should promote our achievements and allow future ideals to be nurtured within them. We are in an era of transition, especially today, which therefore requires our greatest efforts to complete the great undertaking of the Chinese nation for itself and for all mankind.</p>
<p>According to Kai's opinion, the Chinese nation has two prominent characteristics: (1) Non-individualism; (2) Good at remembering. Kai obtained the above conclusion based on these two concepts, and we can also recognize these two concepts.</p>
<p>The meaning of the first characteristic is this: we are not as individualistic as Europeans, which is clear to everyone; what we express is formalism, that is, everything must have a neat and orderly form, and all things must conform to principles and systems; this result has led our country to produce abstract thought, because abstract thought places the greatest emphasis on the unity of form. Is this non-individualistic characteristic good or bad?</p>
<p>Kai believes that this characteristic has both good and bad aspects. The bad is that it hinders individual creation, neglects the deepest parts of life, advocates mediocrity, and does not strive for the realization of ideals. But its value is not diminished by this, it represents an important form of future ideal society—harmony between people. The future society will never again go into individualism, but will go on to supra-individualism, which is very similar to the characteristics of China. Discarding the bad, first cultivating self-perfection, and then developing towards the point of "integration," the ideal of society can be achieved. It is truly the juncture of "rest" and "premonition," we should be aware.</p>
<p>The second characteristic, "good at remembering," is the opposite of "good at innovation," so we often have conservatism, and other Eastern nations often do so as well. Because we are good at remembering, lifestyles become more enduring, and cultural forms do not decline quickly. Kai believes that if Western culture stops "progressing," it will fall, and its maintenance depends entirely on continuous new inventions. This is a crisis, or the entire thing will be eliminated due to a temporary loss of balance. Western culture is moving too fast, but without foundation; the remedy is to use our "good at remembering." Of course, we are a bit too conservative to the point that there is too little progress. In the future, we should be a little "better at innovating." "Discarding shortcomings and taking strengths," the integration of Eastern and Western cultures will also be the day when the fate of mankind turns.</p>
<p>For ourselves, for mankind, let us build our great undertaking starting from today.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<h3>The Bewilderment of Middle School Students</h3>
<p>— Lin Yan-de</p>
<p>Having spent six precious years of time and energy, I passed the final hurdle (graduation exam) last winter and left the gate of middle school. Due to economic reasons, I don't plan to go to higher education and want to find a job. In this overstaffed society, when a few junior staff members are recruited, there are often five or six hundred people applying. How hopeless it is to find a job! The shadow of graduating and immediately becoming unemployed immediately struck my heart. Recently, I was fortunately hired by an old major company, but I have to feel the seriousness of the employment problem of the entire middle school graduates and the inability of the courses learned to match the application.</p>
<p>Half of the reason for the unemployment of middle school graduates is due to the defects of the social system, but the inadequacy of middle school education itself is hard to shirk the blame. In theory, middle school education is a preparatory stage for going to university, but in fact, it is quite difficult for ordinary parents to support their children until high school graduation. Those who go to university are only a minority of the minority, and the employment of those who do not go to higher education naturally becomes a problem.</p>
<p>I don't want to overly criticize middle school education, but the courses in ordinary high schools are really too heavy. They include Chinese, English, mathematics (including algebra, trigonometry, solid geometry, analytic geometry), biology, physics, chemistry, history, geography, civics, etc. In the teaching of each subject, teachers turn on the record player, and students listen to lectures, take notes, memorize, and cope with exams, taking getting scores as satisfaction. In general, the experimental equipment of schools is completely lacking, and the best students only memorize equations. The commercialization of schools is the biggest defect. Teachers sell knowledge to make a living, and students embrace Buddha's feet at the last minute, cheat for scores to get qualifications, which is the most heartbreaking thing. Therefore, it is natural that middle school graduates are almost incapable of anything and run into walls everywhere.</p>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Education announced the revised teaching hours table for junior and senior high schools. High schools are divided into groups A and B from the second year. Group B focuses on preparing for employment, and the amount of curriculum is slightly reduced. From the third year, schools can set up simple vocational subjects (such as commerce, bookkeeping, accounting, typing, agronomy, cooperative societies, etc.) as appropriate, and students can choose to learn one or two kinds (please see the education news column of this newspaper on March 22). This has already improved the middle school curriculum, and I hope that all schools in Shanghai will immediately comply. At the same time, the enrichment of equipment, the goodness of teachers, the improvement of mathematical methods, and the selection of teaching materials are all essential matters. I especially hope that in the third year of high school, students will be given individual guidance regardless of whether they plan to go to higher education or find employment. The summer vacation is about to begin, and wise educators and school authorities will have good guidance for the lost sheep wandering at the crossroads! (Que Chou)</p>
<p>Historical Talk</p>
<h3>Lessons of History</h3>
<p>— Shi Shu</p>
<p>History certainly does not repeat itself, but precious history is enough to encourage our courage. When I read in the modern history of Turkey that General Kemal resisted the Greek army, after eight years of continuous warfare, most of the territory of Turkey was occupied by the Allied Powers, and the seaports were blockaded, and no military supplies were imported. At this time, a part of the Turkish people were pessimistic and disappointed, and members of Congress and the army also appealed for peace. At that time, the situation in Turkey was indeed similar to the situation in our country now. For example, the seaports were blockaded, and a very small number of people compromised for peace. But we can say that the situation in our country now is much better than the situation in Turkey at that time. For example, our army and people have never been pessimistic and disappointed. Although Turkey had such bad phenomena, General Kemal fiercely opposed all cowardly actions and prepared to endure the final struggle. He aroused the positive spirit of the congressmen, encouraged the soldiers to kill the enemy on the battlefield, and tried to comfort the suffering of the people in the inland. The opportunity he was waiting for finally arrived. On August 25, 1922, a general offensive was launched, pressing the Greek army, capturing key points, and winning victory after victory. The Turkish army then drove straight into Smyrna. At this time, the enemy turned to the Turkish army and demanded a truce. As a result, the Turkish army negotiated peace under strength, and Turkey recovered its old territory in Europe.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to introduce a few wise words of General Kemal to the people of the country: "Our nation will not perish; unless the surface of this earth is not strong enough to carry the weight of our coffin, our nation will perish."</p>
<h3>Interview with Dr. Yin, Director of Leren Hospital (1)</h3>
<p>Specially Equipped with Giant X-ray Machine to Implement Tuberculosis Prevention Movement</p>
<p>The Leren Hospital on Gu Ba Road has recently hired staff members from various departments who are knowledgeable and capable, and has increased equipment to refresh the interior, as reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday, the reporter visited Dr. Yin, the director of the hospital, and he expressed his views on the anti-tuberculosis movement as follows:</p>
<p>"My country's annual mortality rate ranks first in the world, and the number of deaths caused by pulmonary tuberculosis is particularly large. The losses suffered by the people are actually greater than any disaster. If this continues, the harm to the future of the nation is extremely worrying! Shanghai is narrow and densely populated, and the air is bad, which is a place for the reproduction of tuberculosis bacteria. The plan to prevent and contain it is urgent.</p>
<p>Using X-rays to examine the lungs is an important measure for preventing tuberculosis, which we almost all know. However, in order to obtain good results, it is necessary to have a new giant X-ray machine. The presiding physician must be knowledgeable and experienced. For example, in the initial step of lung examination, the physician must properly adjust his eyesight before the examination, and he must be very careful during the examination. Even so, the smallest nodules are still easy to ignore. The only accurate method is photography, and the time, power, and the size and age of the person being examined are all related. The time for developing photos and the temperature of the potion must also be appropriate. Only in this way can excellent photos be obtained for diagnosis. The diagnostic aspect is especially important. If a disease is diagnosed as no disease, the patient's treatment opportunity will be missed. If no disease is diagnosed as a disease, the mental state of the person being examined will suffer the pain of "unwarranted." Our hospital has specially hired experts to preside over the diagnosis. If there is any doubt, we will ask X-ray experts to study together to ensure that the diagnosis is accurate, so that we can treat the symptoms and expect twice the result with half the effort. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Carlton's Ideal Lineup</h3>
<p>— Wang Chu</p>
<p>The Yifeng Opera Troupe, now led by the veteran Carlton, has a fairly strong supporting cast. I am now drafting an ideal lineup in order to form a more perfect troupe. The leading role should belong to the veteran Carlton, supplemented by Jin Suqin and Zhang Yipeng, who will hold the second and third leading roles respectively. Among the Kun operas in the South, Jin Ling can be called the best. She has both appearance and performance singing skills, and is known for her progressive Kun operas. If she cooperates with Zhou's style, it will be a perfect match.</p>
<p>As for Zhang Yipeng, he is also a leader in his field. Anyone who has watched his operas such as Sipingshan and Beihuzhou knows that he is clean and neat, agile, stable, and accurate in his opening fight scenes. With this person's assistance, Carlton can achieve the effect of green leaves setting off the peony.</p>
<p>It is more appropriate to invite Yu Sulian back to her old home to hold the third leading role. It is not enough for her to stand alone, but it is still a good supporting role to have her under his command; her singing and performance skills have already become mainstream. Others, such as Liu Binkun, are also known as Carlton's good generals. Liu was originally a basic actor in Yifeng Society, but later left due to some reason and joined Huangjin, where he was quite popular with the audience. Every time he appeared on stage, the applause was like thunder; it is a pity that his voice cannot be loud. If he had Ma Fulu's voice, it would not be an exaggeration to call him the number one comedian in the North and South.</p>
<p>Now, if he returns to Yifeng Society, there will be many good cooperation. In the original lineup of Yifeng Society, Gao Baisui held a special leading role, hoping that he would play more roles such as copper hammers. He can perform this type of role quite well. Gao's voice is very good, and his singing can be called Huang Zhong Dalu. It is hoped that he will study more and specialize in copper hammers. Gao himself may not be willing to do this, but looking at Yifeng Society, only He Yingkui is a professional copper hammer actor, but he cannot handle the more important roles in the play, so Gao is the only choice.</p>
<p>There is no good young male actor in the South. I have seen Liu Wenkui play the role, and he can still handle it. He can play all the young male roles. The other roles, such as Wang Lanfang's Huadan, can be compared with Furongcao; Lu Lingyun's Jiazi Erhua, Zhang Yueting and Liu Ting's sweeping old male actors, are all hard-core and can add luster to the leading actors.</p>
<p>There is Li Changshan, who is also a member of Yifeng Society, but his name is not very famous, and his role is very low. This person's art is very good, and he can play both male and comedian roles. It is heard that he and Carlton are brothers of the same teacher. It is hoped that he will be promoted more and not let him be unknown, so that his talent will not be buried.</p>
<p>If the above-mentioned ideal lineup is adopted by the authorities and realized, it will undoubtedly be more welcomed by the audience.</p>
<h3>Prelude to "Ah Q"</h3>
<p>— A Han</p>
<p>"The True Story of Ah Q" not only laid the ideological direction of my country's new literature for Mr. Lu Xun, but also undoubtedly laid Mr. Lu Xun's authority in the world of literature. Because this is an anti-feudal work full of justice, many playwrights in our country have had the courage to put it on the stage, but because Mr. Lu Xun was deeply afraid that once it was put on the stage, it would violate the original meaning, he always expressed his opposition. Later, after Mr. Lu Xun passed away, many playwrights could no longer bear it, so Mr. Tian Han, Yuan Muzhi, Xu Xingzhi and other gentlemen all adapted "The True Story of Ah Q" into scripts. I remember that the Shanghai Drama Art Society once performed "Ah Q" last year, which was Mr. Xu Xingzhi's script.</p>
<p>Recently, after "Xin Meimu Xiang," Zhonglu also plans to stage "Ah Q," which was adapted by Mr. Chen Yu. Chen Yu doesn't need to be introduced. He is also a first-class playwright in China, so his consciousness is naturally very accurate. Zhonglu attaches great importance to this play. Not only is it actively rehearsing at the moment, but in terms of the lineup, it can be said that the entire troupe of Zhonglu is mobilized. All the important actors include Zhao Shu as Zhao Taiye, Wu Chunzhen as Zhao Taiye's wife, Ge Xin as Zhao Qiye, Tang Di as Zhao Xiucai and the prison director, Huang He as Lu Da, Tang Qi as Kong Yiji and Xu Erhu, Wang Wei as Liujin girl and little nun, Lin Na as Bayi's wife, Sun Jinglu as Qijin's wife, Lan Qing as Wu Ma, and Liao Fan as Wang Laihu and Hongyanjing A Yi, etc.</p>
<p>In the past, Zhonglu often adopted the A and B system for each performance, but now it is because it is not enough to allocate, and some have to play dual roles, which shows that it is a large-scale performance. Among them, the protagonist Ah Q is played by director Ji Jingbo. His proficient acting skills and fluent vernacular have long been famous in the mainland. Shanghai seems to be relatively unfamiliar, but Boro in "Ge Nengniang" and Bai Cishan in "Two Worlds" have also left a deep impression on the general audience. In my opinion, he will be quite successful in playing Ah Q. The whole play is divided into five acts and takes about three hours to perform.</p>
<p>Teapot Song Talk</p>
<h3>Brief Commentary on the First Performance of Suo Lin Gui by Guan Yanqiu (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>Advantage 3 In the last scene, Zhao Shouzheng asked Xue Ma (ie Xue Xiangling,) why she was crying when she saw Suo Lin, there was no seat at first, and after answering a few words, she ordered the maid to set up a seat, and then asked a few more words, and moved the seat to the guest seat, and then asked a few more words, she knew that she was indeed the benefactor who gave the treasure in the past, so she changed the seat to the upper seat, and added the maid's cicada playing, which was very interesting, but the maid's words "Wood can generate fire..." were rude and inappropriate, and can be deleted.</p>
<p>Weaknesses There are as many as six or seven comedian roles in the whole play, and the gossiping is too verbose, which can be merged and saved to clear the clues. Also, Xue's playing games with Lu Gongzi in the garden takes too long, and the audience feels bored, so it should be reduced later.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about Yan's singing. Yanqiu's singing skills are unique. In the past two years, they have become more precise. In this play, the Er Liu board and flowing water sections in the scene of meeting and giving, such as the oblique wind blowing fine rain, two points diagonally down from above, each with force, Pu can use the Yinping Jue Ao high tune, each sentence is lifted up, like the Yu Chu font, thin and hard, the cavity is also unique, singing this kind of cavity, I know it takes the most effort, because each word is lifted up and sung. There is a sentence at the end of the two chopsticks singing in the garden, suddenly rising from the bottom to the highest point, and then falling back to the main one. This kind of singing method is very strange to the ear, and can be called extremely new; is it like using dangerous rhymes in writing poetry? In the Er Liu board of the reunion scene, the "original board" is added with the "crying head", and the tone of "my son's mother" and "my son" is like Nanbangzi and changes the tail, which suddenly feels new. Wang's school has a crying head in the Er Liu of Changting, which Qingyi has never had. In short, the whole play is extremely complicated, and there is no sentence that is not new. Once this play comes out, it will overwhelm everything. Yanqiu wants to be realistic in her acting, and her vernacular is especially small when she is sad or ashamed. I think this may cause the audience below to not be able to hear clearly. I wonder if it can be changed to be louder?</p>
<h3>Ye Qiuxin and Qiu Yunyan Will Go to Pingjin Together Today</h3>
<p>— Hai Sheng</p>
<p>Ye Qiuxin's niece, Qiu Yunyan (note, she is the daughter of the late actor Zhang Mingwu, originally named Xuezhen), is a rising Kun actor who is ambitious and wants to go to Beiping for further study. She happened to meet Qiuxin's opportunity to go to Tianjin, so they decided to go together. This time she went north to apprentice to Wang Yaoqing and Shang Xiaoyun, preparing to bury herself in hard work there. She does not plan to return to Shanghai in the short term until her art has reached a considerable level of achievement and she forms a troupe to perform. Qiu Yunyan is a beautiful and smart child. If she can truly study hard, she will always have her share in a bright future.</p>
