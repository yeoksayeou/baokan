<p>柏林　蘇聯向羅馬尼亞要求之土地有人口三百萬人、範圍四千零三十方哩、一九三四年、因羅國保證蘇聯西部邊境領土之完整、曾停止要求比薩拉比亞及布柯維納之歸還、（二十七日合衆電）</p>
<p>倫敦　義國通訊社發表羅馬尼亞京城消息、謂蘇聯政府已向羅政府要求交還比薩拉比亞及布柯維納之北部、該消息尚未山中立方面微實、內稱、蘇聯外委長莫洛托夫昨日邀羅馬尼亞公使會談、卽向提出此項要求、限於今晚前答復、蘇聯飛機現已飛於羅境天空、羅國政界大爲震動、德國官立通訊社亦發表所接羅京傳至之此項消息、其中並稱、最後通牒限於今日下午十時期滿、又據該通訊社發表匈京傳出消息、謂聞羅國御前會議已決議接受此項要求、（二十七日路透電）</p>

<p>羅京　羅馬尼亞政府當局昨晚通告羅國之拉斯航空公司、所有經過羅馬尼亞東部之航空服務、均須停止航行、聞政府採取此事之動機、與軍事有關、因羅國東邊堡壘頗多、飛機經過、對於保持軍事機密、不無妨碍、（二十七日海通電）</p>

<h3>美國同時注意歐亞兩洲局勢　大部軍艦仍然留夏威夷</h3>
<p>費城　據美國消息靈通人士宣稱、華盛頓現注視歐洲或遠東局勢、孰較關切、殊難斷言、目前國務院及白宮方面、雖無甚消息可得、但據所知、以上兩處對於二者均極重視、非官塲方面現取日本之行動及續作行動之威脅、與墨索里尼自以爲可安然實行之行動相比擬、日本若推翻太平洋之現狀、美國如有行動、則又將何若、目下尚難加以臆測、美國太平洋艦隊之布置、此間及檀香山方面、仍如在五里霧中、雖有若干軍艦已開向巴拿馬運河方面、一般人皆信、大部份軍艦將仍留夏威夷領海、或以東之各點、據政治觀察家之意見、多數人咸信、美艦隊之所以如此久駐太平洋中部者、卽係預防有目前所發生局勢之可能性、美國之注意係屬多方面的、包括對華貿易巨大損失之可能性、維持菲列濱之獨立、維持遠東方面橡皮·錫·鎢之供給、以及美國之一般譴責侵略、並拒絕承認由武力造成之領土變更、若干政治觀察家認爲、政府若非漸成爲完全孤立派、（目前尚毫無此種微象）、則日本細俊六將軍宣言中所暗示之恫嚇、果見實行時、美國之有行動、殆不可避免、共和黨大會之完全不顧現實、可於該黨之黨綱表示之、甚至對於嚴重威脅美國利益及橡皮佔重要地位之美國防務程序的局勢、亦竟視若無覩也、（二十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>紐約　美報對美艦隊由夏戚夷羣島出發後之行踪秘密、頗多猜測、一般人認爲、該艦隊係向巴拿馬運河開駛、至少須十日始能抵達、因美國沿岸之砲台、業已增强、巴拿馬運河之兩口、亦有已佈水雷網之說、蛛絲馬跡、耐人尋味、有人認爲、美艦隊如駛往大西洋、則羅斯福總統或有佔領南美及西印度法國殖民地之意念、或具有對德取瑟而歌之意、因德·義如能控制法國之海軍、則軸心國方面之海軍實力、將大見增强也、（二十七日海通社電）</p>

<h3>英國軍力强盛制勝具有把握　陸相艾登廣播演說</h3>
<p>倫敦　陸相艾登昨夜廣播表示英國必能擊退德方攻擊之完全信念、略謂德國旣已摧毀英國外圍之自由城堡、不久將進攻吾人土地、敵機夜襲行將繼續爲之、敵方且或將採用其他攻擊方法、但必遭擊退、而吾人亦將使敵人在其本國境內時常遭受天空還擊、吾人深知吾國人決不退縮、吾人從法國可悲命運中獲聞文明不能僅用物質的方法而獲保全之敎訓、鋼骨水泥之碉堡、不足濟事、唯有運用全國之人的精神與人的志願、始能致最後之勝利、茲値危險時期、我民族之組織纖維將受艱苦之測騐、但吾人心中亦知今日有罕遇之偉大機會、卽英帝國現有獨自維護恢復並將來擴張自由範圍之機會也、來自英帝國各部之軍隊、現集於英倫、此乃帝國人民對於正義一致奮發之驚人景象、法蘭西民族在其悲痛呻吟中、唯屬望吾人保全可寳貴的文明、苟吾人與海外同胞不表示保全文明之堅强不撓的志願、則此文明勢必絕跡於歐洲、一般受敵方鐵蹄之蹂躪者、旣屬望於吾人之勝利、吾人安可使其失望、艾登力勸國人在被攻擊時、勿自相驚擾、謂法國戰敗乃難民麕集有以助成之、我英人宜以此爲鑒、敵方不久將知靜坐受炸而不反抗非英人之性質、吾人有極堅空軍將痛創敵人、我空軍雖在不利之環境中作戰、然仍予敵以重創、我空軍常以寡敵衆、當英軍從鄧扣克撤退時、我，空軍曾於一日內擊落敵機多至七十架、而左吾人本國天空中我空軍之戰絞、當可視此尤佳、如敵機偶爾竄人英國上空、而我機未與之接戰、則國人勿怒問我空軍何所事事、須知我空軍在百哩外正擊退敵機而保護我國防務所繫之工廠船塢船隻與機塲免遭損害也、吾人現有飛機甚夥、今後逐日增多、但吾人須用之於最可摧毀敵人之處、我國所遍置之高射砲與前夜捉獲敵機兩架之阻塞氣球、亦爲我國人所不應忘者、余非謂國人不致遭轟炸、但余可爲國人告者、敵機之命運、殊不足羨也、吾人現成一砲壘、但在英倫三島上、僅以擊退攻擊爲能事、則殊無濟、我國中執戈之士、現有一百二十五萬人、而澳洲與紐絲綸新軍之開到、及英軍與協約軍之自法返英、更使我國兵力大增、爲從前所未有、吾人深信必能以充分軍隊擊潰希圖在英登陸之敵軍、今夜余以有限制的樂觀精神發言、余固知吾人須遭遇艱苦時日、但余亦知吾人能力與精神、足以應付任何艱難、僅採守勢或作反攻決不能決勝、他日必有吾人對敵進攻之日、屆時我國人定見吾人以全力爲之、目前吾人已在他處進攻而致勝利、近東我軍具此進攻精神頗形活動、此誠前途佳兆也（二十七日路透）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>海國海軍向背如何</h3>
<p>德法之間暨義法之間，停戰協定經雙方簽字成立，業已正式公布，並實行停戰；所謂西綫戰事，至是全部結束。歐洲戰局倘循旣往之直綫而發展，則今後戰事，一方面爲德軍進攻英國之戰；另一方面爲英義在地中海與非洲之戰。吾人茲不必預測二戰將如何勝敗，但在決定勝敗之前，有一極關重要，且極饒趣味之問題，目前尚難明瞭而不日便可分曉者，即法國海軍之向背是。</p>
<p>云何向背？法國海軍遵從波爾多貝當政府之命令，即按照德法停戰協定第八條之規定：一法國海軍除少數在海外保護殖民地者外，應集結於指定港岸在德義監督下解除武裝；德國鄭重保證，除爲防護海岸，及掃雷者外，決不用法國海軍從事戰鬬行爲，因此，法國應將海外軍艦除維護殖民地帝國者外，槪行召回。」亦按照義法停戰協定第十二條之規定：「法國海軍艦隊除德義政府准其在海外保護法國殖民地者外，應結集於指定港岸，在德義監督之下，解除武裝；因此，法國所有在海外之艦隊，除維護殖民地利益外，應將其召回；義政府申明在戰爭期內，無利用法國海軍作戰之意；在和議之後，對法國海軍亦無何要求；但在停戰期內，義政府保留使用法國艦隊之權利，使之從事掃除水雷工作。」此法國海軍可取之態度一也。法國海軍不問倫敦方面所謂法國臨時國民委員會組成與否，仍與英國艦隊站於一條戰綫，繼續與德義作戰。此法國海軍可取之態度又一也。</p>
<p>原法國海軍佔世界第四位。英美日本之外，德義兩國皆非法國之比也。試作簡表，比較如次：</p>
<p>國　艦數　噸數</p>
<p>英　三〇一　一三〇七〇八三</p>
<p>法　一七六　五二〇七三二</p>
<p>義　二一八　四二八九二一</p>
<p>德　六五　一三五二五七</p>
<p>海軍力量强弱，得由各種不同之觀點而作各種不同之審察；噸數多寡初非判斷標準，然作大體之比較，固不妨以噸數爲衡。據右表所列噸數，若英法相加，以抗德義，則英法較多三倍而强，此絕對優勢也。若法艦與德義爲伍，以抗英國，則英國比較稍多，然英艦尚須酌留於印度洋太平洋及遠東，未能全部在大西洋與地中海作戰；是英國非但未能把握優勢，雖謂相形見絀，亦無不可。因此之故，僅就歐洲海權而論，法國海軍實居舉足重輕之地位。自德國陸上作戰勝利，法國屈服之後，德義爲對英作戰計，豈不欲取法國海軍以供己用？顧德法停戰協定第八條保證不使法國海軍從事戰鬥；義法停戰協定第十二條，除聲明不使法國海軍從事戰鬥外，且進一步聲明，將來締結和約之時，對法國海軍無所要求；此其故何歟？謂法國海軍力量不足齒數歟？謂仁義道德歟？皆非也。蓋德義明知德義海軍初非英國之敵，然德國自信者在空軍陸軍，義國對於空軍亦頗自負，以爲即此亦足以制英。誠使竟得驅策法國海軍，錦上添花，自是大佳；顧又明知法國海軍或不願戰，或願戰則必袒英，將無樂從德義而與英國抗衡者。故停戰協定所保證所聲明者，絕非軍事見地而爲政治策略；保證之，聲明之，僅以爲淵毆魚，爲叢毆雀之戒，許以保全，母驅之供英國之用而已。</p>
<p>法國海軍固將如何向背？揭曉不遠，茲不可知。然其影響所及，直接有關德軍進攻英國之戰，英義在地中海之戰；間有關法國波爾多政府對於戰勝國之地位，國民委員會對於法國各殖民地之地位。更推而遠之，固亦隱然爲國際方來演變中之一種重要因素焉。前日電傳法屬越南總督稱述英法在遠東方面聯合艦隊力量之强；昨日又傳波爾多政府已免越督之職；即此二訉，雖無從確悉其詳，亦可覘知牽涉遠大而個中微妙。然則法國海軍如何向背，謂非極可注意歟？</p>

<h3>日本野心畢露　南進殆迫不及待　傳日卽在港或越南登陸　美國維護權益必有表示</h3>
<p>據外人方面消息、在東京之印度獨立聯盟會、向日本及德國當局提出要求、保存法屬越南及荷屬東印度之自由、該會通過決議稱、日本應在亞洲協助安南及荷印保持其獨立、成立亞洲之兩個國家此種行動、將被亞洲人士一致贊助、對於德國、則除慶賀其在對法戰勝外、並要求德國「强迫」法國及荷蘭維持安南及荷印之完全自由、</p>
<p>香港越南　形勢緊急</p>
<p>大陸報云、此間政界昨（二十六日）夜接私人消息、據稱、日軍及領署當局星期一日向香港英當道提出封閉香港接濟重慶路綫之要求後、香港當道、已開始將重要文件、移往新加坡、聞日方又要求與重慶政府有關係之華方官員與機關、一概逐出香港、國際通訊社香港電傳、日軍四師、已從日本開來中國、據昨夜在上海方面探悉、該批日軍將在香港或越南附近登陸、其目的地若爲香港、則若輩將在二十八或二十九日開到登岸、</p>
<p>英國政策　極堪重視</p>
<p>昨日路透電稱、倫敦方面、已接到英國駐日大使克萊琪轉來之日政府要求、日方請英國採取有效辦法、停止一切戰爭物料供應品、經緬甸及香港運入中國、英政府對此要求、刻正在審核考慮中、本埠華人方面、對此極爲關心、惟英國當局諒應澈底認識、與侵略者讓步及妥洽、非但不能獲得苟安之局、更且助長侵略者之野心、以往事實、數見不鮮、英政府亦當有所明瞭、</p>
<p>荷印海軍　實力強大</p>
<p>字林西報云、荷國海軍、在荷屬東印度方面、現仍維持正常狀態、其數目雖少、然戰鬥力則極強大、其中包括新型巡洋艦四艘、內路脫（Ruytir六四五〇噸）與德倫浦（TromP三三五〇噸）現均在本國領海內、在荷國沿海各地、亦均泊有防禦戰船及武裝砲艦、並有自一五〇噸至二百六十四噸之魚雷艇及潛水艇十三艘、其載重約在五百噸以上、駐東印度艦隊、則有巡艦二艘、配備十英吋之巨砲、及驅逐艦八艘、潛水艇七艘、以上艦艇、遇必要時、均得載飛機或設置魚雷、</p>
<p>美國必將　有所行動</p>
<p>英文大美晚報昨晚發表著名英籍評論家伍德海氏討論日本南進所引起之後果一文、據伍氏意見、東京當局是否將採取較封鎖越南更爲積極之舉動、目下未能下斷語、總之、日本國內一部分人士、極力主張、</p>
<p>利用歐戰局勢、以打擊英美法三國、米內政府、實行結束在華戰事之失敗、引起各方人士之不滿、將來或將改組內閣、由極端派主持、若輩企圖「驅逐擁護東亞舊秩序國家一之野心、昭然若揭、彼等以爲越南已係</p>
<p>「成熟果實一觸可落」、彼等苟能握權、控制大局、則日本必將實行與英美決裂、美國對於日本侵略越南之反嚮、目前尚未能妄加預測、以美國利益而論、美國對於維持荷屬東印度之現狀、較諸越南更爲關懷、蓋荷屬東印度</p>
<p>出產橡皮佔全世界產額五分之二、但同時美國對於維持雲南鐵路之交通、亦有實質利益、蓋該鐵路爲中國政府輸出貨物償還美款之唯一出口、中國桐油鎢鐵及鋁、大部份均賴該路輸出、</p>
<p>緬滇公路目前所能運輸之貨物、僅數百噸、伍氏最後以爲法國以現下情境而論、因不能拒絕日方要求、但其接受日本要求後、結果阻礙中美貿易、則美國當局必向日法兩方提出强硬抗議無疑、</p>
<h3>「七七」事變　三週年</h3>
<p>七七事變三週年紀念日、轉瞬卽屆、本市各界、以是日爲抗戰建國民族復興肇端、屆時將一致以靜默之態度、作莊生之紀念、並為陣亡將士誌哀、按是日經中央規定爲抗戰建國紀念日、全國各地均將熱烈紀念、惟本市因環境特殊、仍如去年停止紀念儀式、公共租界工部局法租界公董局、以當此時局不靖、爲防止不良份子乘機滋事起見、將先期採取戒備、禁阻各種集會、屆時並施行特別戒備一天、以資防範、而維治安、</p>
<h3>日偽覬覦法院　當局不予置理　工部局否認進行談判</h3>
<p>日僞覬覦上海特區之法院、久有蓄意、不知該法院係中國政府與在華訂有條的各國所協定而構成、在未廢棄協定之前、雙方均應遵守、不能由一方之意思、擅自交與僞方、昨據英文大美晚報云、上海工部局總辦兼總裁費利溥二十七日晨、再度否認日本大使館發言人所作關於木埠特區地方法院法權之聲明、據謂此項問題、並未進行談判、且該法院係由中國政府與在華訂有條的各國所構成、工部局與法院、並無任何方式之關係、工部局之所關切者、厥爲上海特區地方法院能有效的繼續行使職務、受理民刑案件而已、</p>
<h3>香港已弛米禁　工部局准鼓勵小麥進口</h3>
<p>上海機製切麵業同業公會前曾呈請市商會轉呈當局、疏通小麥來源、昨奉市商會復函云、逕復者、頃接上海公共租界工部局副總辦葛勃函稱、奉貴會六月十七日來函、爲疏通小麥來源一節、敝局當竭力鼓勵相當數量之小麥進口、藉慰市民之懷、諸祈釋懷、</p>
<p>豆米行業</p>
<p>同業公會曾一度派員籲請公共租界工部局要求轉請英總領事交涉港米准運上海接濟、以期安定市况、昨向米業界方面探得確訊、本市裕生隆等號刻接香港米商來電報告、謂香港當局業已弛禁、准米糧外運、衆料其原因不外海防香港通航、貢米已可直接運港、本市各業行號自海防香港通航後、卽委託法商達孚洋行致電西貢訂購大量貢米的一萬噸左右、茲悉五千噸貢米</p>
<p>業已啓運</p>
<p>七月十日左右卽可抵埠、現甫在運滬途中、又悉本市各業行號爲增加存底、消除民食恐慌起見、除委購西貢洋米運滬接濟外、並繼續委託英商合義洋行致電暹羅訂購大量暹羅洋米、達一萬三千餘噸、茲悉合義洋行裝瑞拉司馬勒輪五六〇〇噸、七月十八日抵埠、裝別利維格輪四六〇〇噸、七月二十六日抵埠、至於濟南華行所訂之三二〇〇噸、須至七月二十六日抵埠、合共一萬三千四百噸、現各米業行號仍擬絡續委託各該洋行、訂購巨量洋米、以便决第運滬調劑、</p>
<h3>英大使寇爾　星期六播音</h3>
<p>由渝返滬之英駐華大使寇爾、將於本星期六（六月二十九日）在電台（Xmhd）播音、該電台週波七六〇合三九五米突、屆時並由電台（Xcdm）週波一四四〇合二〇八米突轉播、該日英大使將作兩决廣播、第一次爲上海夏季時問正午十二時四十五分（卽中國沿海時間上午十一時四十五分、第二次爲上海夏季時間下午九時（卽中國沿海時間下午八時）、</p>
<h3>天津方面　統制紗布</h3>
<p>爲統制進口貨初步　他貨將遭同樣待遇</p>
<p>中日戰事發生後、華北首先淪陷、致各業均遭控制、至於烟台·威海衛·龍口·靑島等口岸、進出口貿易、各貨皆已統制、實行以來、近將一載、賣買並無現鈔實行物物交易、年來商賈不勝其苦、卽洋商亦受相當影響、惟天津一埠、商業尚無變化、雖什糧麵粉售價、已被規定、但進出口貨尚未統制、近聞華北方面布疋、日貨大覺傾銷、爲謀獨覇市塲計、七月一日起、天津進口之疋頭棉紗、先行統制、以達其獨覇之意、故木市津帮客家、對疋紗採辦、已見减少、以免無謂損失、目前雖祗疋紗統制、但將來各物亦難免同樣實行、</p>
<h3>滬西「特警」　成立無期</h3>
<p>違法行爲賡續不輟　特警殆將無法組織</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、工部局與「上海市府」、於本年二月十六日卽已簽訂滬西越界築路區警務協定、惟該區特別警察隊尚無成立之望、據公共租界警務處某高級官員告記者稱、警務處已提出組織特警隊之建議、正待「市府」答覆、未接答覆時、特警隊之成立、</p>
<p>絕無進展</p>
<p>西區有賭窟存在、爲特警隊成立之主要障碍、不久以前、賭窟多數停閉、惟今已改換名義、重行開業、此種違法行爲、賡續不輟、則西區警務力不能成立、故非待西區賭塲悉數停閉特警隊</p>
<p>始能成立</p>
<p>該官員續稱、一俟「市府」置覆、而予同意、特警隊卽可着手組織、惟目下特警隊人選、尚未擇定、今未能言定特警隊何時可告成立、因不知「市府」方面將於何時答覆、按西區警務協定規定新警隊的由警官警察一千二百人組成、若輩將從公共租界警務處及「市警局」中選出、</p>
<h3>美艦離滬</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、美艦大理石號·呂宋號·及沃湖號、定今日（廿七日）午刻駛離上海、內巡洋艦大理石號前往靑島、可望於一週或十日內返滬、江防砲艦呂宋號與沃湖號則赴長江一行、或將在三天內返上海、按大理石號係本月十二日來滬駐泊、兩砲艦則係本月十五日從華南駛抵上海、</p>
<h3>泰晤士報館　發生怠工風潮</h3>
<p>愛多亞路一百六十號泰晤士報館全體工人一百餘人、因近日米價物價飛漲、生活日艱、每月所得工資三十元、不能維持生活、全體工人、於前日（二十六日）推派代表數人、向館方要求增資、三十元以下加六成、四十元以下加五成半、五十元以下加五成、五十元以上加四成牛、勞資雙方談判後、資方尤於三日後答復、昨日館方米答復、工人方面卽怠工、工部局政治部得知、派員前往調解無效、全體工人於下午出館、聞館方限工人卽刻恢復工作、否則卽實行解僱、</p>
<h3>兩收容所結束</h3>
<p>慈善團體自對所屬難民收容所開始遣散工作後、難民人數已由五萬人减至二萬七千餘、而在本月底、又將有二處收容所結束、一爲在北蘇州路僞「市商會」內之屬於慈聯總會之愛文收容所、一爲文監師路屬於慈聯分會之第一收容所、兩收容所均在滬戰發生時開辦、目前人數、的共七百餘名、該兩收容所內之難胞、除一部份給資遣散外、餘悉併入惇信路收容所、慈聯分會並定於今日在愛多亞路會所發給遣散費（成人每名十七元、小孩每名十五元、）該會敎導組規定各所難童學校、於七月八日舉行學期會考、十五日起開始暑期補習、又目下難胞每名每月已達十元左右、亟盼捐助、</p>
<h3>上海同胞　響應寒衣運動　認定代金五十萬元</h3>
<p>重慶二十七日電、全國徵募寒衣運動總會、日前召開全體委員會議時、曾決定本年度發動徵募運動、至詳細辦法、正在擬訂中、而上海同胞於聞訊之餘、卽首先來電響應、並先行認定寒衣代金額五十萬元、足見上海同胞處身水深火熱之境、而盼念英勇抗戰將士、更爲殷切、殊足令人感奮、</p>
<h3>悼雷鳴遠神交父（下）</h3>
<p>— GBC</p>
<p>雷氏甘心神貧，自奉菲薄，其所服御，率皆陳舊不堪，由黑而黃，久應束之高閣，然而他仍然照舊使用，不忍割愛。他自奉雖然苛刻，然待人　極仁厚，已經做到『有求必應』的地步，不但對待中國人如此，就是遇到比·法•德·奧的人，也是如此。聽說他的『哀矜』是普遍的，只要他有，實在沒有國籍和種族的區分。同學們時常向他要格言，而他時常寫給的，總是那句老話：『愛德之所在，天主亦在焉』。他的確具有愛德，並且非常的謙遜，我們從來沒有聽見他說過中國一字不好，在他的觀點中，中國樣樣是好。他常常的勸誡靑年，不要批評別人家的長短，因爲十個判斷有九個是錯誤的。他絕對的服從聖敎　，愛護神職班，最深惡痛絕的，是無神派和反對宗敎的學說。</p>
<p>雷氏活了六十三歲，具有兼人的才智，所以做出驚人和兼人的事業，是成功，是失敗，暫　莫論，但是這種勇往追前只事耕耘不問收穫的精神，已足令懦怯者退步，况創業之人，不一定就是成功之人，不知歷史上有多少前例。但雷氏這樣的終身辛勤，奮鬬犧牲，捨已愛人，旣不羨名，又不牟利，在普通人的眼光觀之，豈不是『一塲到頭總是空」嗎？雷氏豈不是在迷惘中，他的目標和動機何在？我們也分析過雷氏的言行，當然不是化學物理的分析，而是一個理智的合乎倫理的分析，覺得他的一言一行，不管在什麼時間和地方，不管用什麼口吻和方式，總有一個最後鵠的，如同巨川細流朝宗於海的一般，就是『愛天主於萬有之上，愛主於人，愛　如己』。他這樣的說，他這樣的做，如何在他的骨髓深處，血液裏面，　有天主的影子，和上述最高的誡命，總而言之，雷鳴遠是神父，神父的使命，是超性的，不是本性的。</p>
<p>雷氏於七七事變以前，頗努力於社會事　，不但手創天津和北平的益世報，就是馳譽海內的大公報，他和北平英斂之先生同爲發起人和創辦人，故雷之去也，新聞界極表哀悼與同情。七七事變以後，雷氏復馳驅南北戰塲，專事救護工作，久聞其力疾從公，　其一病不起。當此曙光在望，勝利可報，而雷氏竟齎志以歿，長眠歌樂山旁，引領西望，涕泗滂沱、詩云：『人之云亡，邦國殄瘁』，嗚呼痛哉！（完）</p>

<p>前日南滙縣境兩米號、僱船至黃橋、購得白米二船、計三百六十餘擔、裝回時行經閘港、被携械匪徒六七人、假查艙爲名、將米船及夥友九人盡行刦去、將米出賣該地鄰近、夥友九人、一律慘殺滅口、事隔多日、事主偵聞上情、據實報告、派長警前往調查、不料該警行動不密、被匪徒所悉、亦被匪徒殺死滅跡、又有該船戶之親戚、在「閘港設麻袋店、見兩空船停靠在該港口北里許之浦灘中、無人看管、遂通知伊戚前往認領、甫欲將空船帶回、突來武裝者五六人、將尋船之四人、一併拘去、當晚毒打一頓、將四人活埋於閘港近郊、內有船主之子徐桂生、尚壯年、拼命從泥土中扒出、蛇行至近村求救、送至周浦醫院求治、亦因傷重延四日死在醫院、現在該地米商、大多不敢出辦米糧、致欽公塘一帶、已無米可糶、故米價高於上海、且人民已無米可買、焦急萬分、</p>
<h3>南市難區　發放恩糧</h3>
<p>南市難民區因饒神父離滬、決於本月底結束後、區內辦事處刻正積極辦理遣散手續、規定每一遣散難民給予恩糧一月、亦已於昨日起開始發放、其發放日程及數量如下、二十七日（卽昨日）發糧六天、計白米三磅、二十八日發九天、計四磅半、二十九日發十天、計五磅、三十日發六天、計三磅、至本月底發竣、共發三十一天、共十五磅半、區內領糧難民、至最近尚有一萬九千人左右、善後委員會雖規定老弱移送新普育堂收容、惟該堂限於地位、僅能收容四五百名、是以大部難民、均在疏散之列、據悉主持該區工作之監察委員會及總辦事處、均至本月底隨難民之疏散而宣告結束、僅謝士柏主持之善後委員會、因區內尚有新普育堂第一醫院慈善產科醫院等設施、仍將暫維工作、</p>
<h3>日銀行鈔票額　已增一倍</h3>
<p>自日本發動侵華戰事以來、因軍費支出浩繁、致其國內金融陷於枯竭、通貨益形膨脹、據本年三月末之統計、日本全國紙幣發行之總數、計有日本銀行票三十萬二千四百萬元、朝鮮銀行蔡四萬四千四百萬元、台灣銀行票一萬六千五百萬元、此外尚另有輔幣券二萬四千六百萬元、故總共有紙幣額三十八萬七千九百萬元、較之去年計增有十二萬一千萬元、的合百分之四五•三、按自一九三七年「中國事件」發生以後、日本通貨之膨脹、計增有百分之九四·五〇、的增一倍、若以之與一九二八年相較、則日本之通貨膨脹、計有百分之二二五•八〇矣、日本之通貨膨脹、顯然並非爲商業上之應用、蓋在市塲上之支票流通、並不比較的增加也、以此之故、日本之通貨膨脹、當爲純受戰事所致、</p>
<h3>統一公債本息　將開始付款</h3>
<p>暗市價格高漲</p>
<p>民國二十五年統一公債第九次本息、中中交農四行已尤貼現後、準七月三十一日由中央銀行及其委託之銀行開始付款、上海證券暗市因還本付息期近、且政府維持債信已有決心、所以價格高漲、昨日收盤行市、甲種六十一元三角漲三角半、乙種五十一元八角漲二角、丙種五十元零五分漲二角半、戊種四十九元八角漲三角半、</p>
<h3>巴黎末批郵件　業已輪運到滬</h3>

<h3>王家臣調虎離山　竊盜金飾被拘　人急智生偷竊表叔財物　扭交捕房諭令具保候核</h3>
<p>甬籍靑年王家臣、會受相當敎育、中日戰事爆發之前、在本市華界經營商業、頗能溫飽、兵燹之後、家業蕩然、從此賦閒、與其妻困處法租界麥琪路麥琪里四十七號、三載以來、舉債度日、凡係在滬親友、皆曾向之稱貸、比以米珠薪桂、且其妻又將臨盆、需款益亟、欲續作</p>

<p>睹其光彩雖極燦爛、而重量似覺不稱、隨啟箱篋、取眞金鐲比較後、斷係贋鼎、王卽更易語調、謂此來除求審定飾物眞僞外、因欲遷移、適隣里有餘房出租、乞移玉同往租賃、梅芳從之、及抵該處、王又以室小難容眠床爲慮、着沈妻暫留彼地、渠須遄歸量床、乃重返沈家、向其女傭詭稱、頃因有筆一枝、遺於室內、騙得房門鎖匙、卽與該女、傭法幣一元、令赴市購繩、作量床之用、彼則開門入室、</p>
<p>私取箱篋竊取金鐲一只、嵌賣金戒兩枚、暨銀行存摺契據等件、旋將金飾分別售與南京路某百貨商店、及銀樓、頓時季子多金、而其妻未幾亦分娩、彼更經人吹噓、獲得圓明園路九十七號某種職業、人財兩得、環境改觀、惟沈夫婦是日次第回家、發覺被竊事件、向女傭盤詰後、逆知乃表姪王家臣所爲、徒以莫明其住處、無從追究、近始微聞王之服務地點、姑時往</p>
<p>圓明園路一帶尋覓、前日下午果與相遇、當卽鳴捕拘送該管虹口捕房、昨晨解赴第一特區地方法院鞠審、該犯當庭自白不諱、並一再表示懺悔、願設法賠償金飾之代價、乞免治罪、庶其一家三口、俱獲保全、但沈文明夫婦則以被告行踪飄忽、徜遂予釋出、所遭損失、將無着落爲言、旋由審判長考核之下、以爲雙方旣屬親戚、姑予從寬、論令王家臣具殷實店保、出外料理、聽候改期傳訊、</p>

<h3>馮炳南紀念母壽詞（一）　闡揚八德精義歸於至孝　勸儉與自動為八德基礎</h3>
<p>昨晚九時，馮炳南先生之第四公子振威君，假座新新電台，代表其尊人播講五敎要義演詞，關係社會福利者至爲切要，用特將其轉錄如下：</p>
<p>六月二十九日，爲紀念家母的七十壽辰。由二十九日起，每天下午五點半至七點半（新鐘點），在八仙橋靑年會開始連續舉行五敎演講五天；就是六月二十九，六月三十，七月一日，七月二日，七月三日，承蔣竹莊等幾位先生熱心擔任主講，這是萬分榮幸，萬分感謝的。本來鄙人應當親自到會塲招待，並且向聽講的各位來賓和主講先生道謝的，可是自從二十六年一病以來，至今尚未復元，行動仍然不能自如，甚至不能坐車子，所以不能親自出來，萬分抱歉。或謂鄙人身體旣然不好，便應該靜居調攝，不應該再辦這五敎演講和其他的什麼事情，應該先用方法來回復自己的健康才是。不過鄙人以爲關於公衆有益的事，不能期待個人身體的健康，如果認爲道件事確實與公衆有益，便應當趕緊去做，因爲身體健康，何時回復，很無把握，若待健康再做，那便杳杳無期了。現在舉行的五敎演講鄙人認爲是紀念家母壽辰的最善的方法。鄙人對於社會認爲必須改良的感覺，不自今年始，多年以前，已經有這個意見，不過在年輕時，忙於求自立，中年時，又爲各種事業服務，閒暇的時間，實在沒有，未遑及此，所以二三十年來，雖時時存着此心，但是時間能力，均感不足，所以遲遲未能爲這個志願覓得一個具體的辦法。自二十六年起，以十分之五六的時間與牀褥作伴，身心都較爲閒暇，便利用這幾年來的閒暇時間，把數十年來積蓄胸中沒有系統的意思，加以整理，計劃如何改良社會的問題，於是漸見具體，漸成系統，不過每逢計劃一個辦法，經歷三數日之後，卽又發覺種種缺憾，於是又須重頭考慮研究，如是者無慮幾十决之多。直至最近，才覺得較爲縝密，較爲進步，然而還未敢十分自信，未敢十分肯定，只算是略具雛形而巳。今年適値家母七十的壽辰，趁此把我幾年來的心得，或者可以獨力舉辦的，或者須待羣力協助的，使他們實現，以爲家母壽辰的紀念。其决則因爲自顧此身生存於社會，已逾半百之年，受賜於社會者甚多，應當對於社會有所酬報。五敎演講，是計劃之一，還有其他，停會兒再說。</p>
<p>父母對於我們劬勞鞠育之恩，昊天罔極，當老人家的一個重大的壽辰，做兒孫的當然要想到給老人家高興，爲老人家做點可留紀念的事。怎樣才是最好的紀念呢？怎樣才會使得老人家高興呢？關於紀念父母的壽辰，世俗自有許多現成的辦法，如果照本抄謄，則我原可不必費心再去計劃。一般世俗的辦法，大概不外宴會親朋，或者唱唱堂會，或者買點老人家所喜歡的東西之類。這些辦法，我以爲都很應該的，因爲一個人對於父母的孝思，是心裏頭的事，我們旣想父母能享受到我們的孝敬，則自然少不了外表的表示，所以宴會，娛樂等等，都是一種孝敬的表示，而爲大多數人所願意採取的辦法，不過鄙人的情形，却有點不同。鄙人一向好靜，而不好動，更不善於酬酢，以爲與其採取浮文縟節，不如用較能持久的方法，以爲紀念，而且家母素性淡泊奪靜，不喜紛華，諄命鄙人力從簡的，不可驚動親友，加以目下世局情形，異常屯蹇，許多人都在受苦的時候，斷不宜鋪張。這是鄙人不敢苟同世俗，以爲家母七秩壽辰紀念的原因。</p>

<h3>金融　外匯賣方聲勢愈盛</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市況、匯豐掛脾、悉無上落、英美匯暗市、潛勢頗鬆、除華銀行最初仍有需要外、投機家港電一致吐塞、乃某種空氣、甚爲囂張、兼以賣方壓力、午前現美匯已告六元一二五、後市賣風愈熾、華銀行亦反進爲出、外行對做尤見鬆硬、現美匯一度成交六元二一八七五、結果尚定、收盤英金三辦士九三七五、美匯六元一八七五、較上日英長〇六二五、美鬆一五六二五、期貨趨勢、與現貨完全相同、</p>

<h3>金市跌勢轉猛</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、走勢平疲、雖上落後忽、跌漲之數尚小、經營者之賣多買少、乃爲市上某種空氣所影饗、而外匯報鬆、價愈難起、晨開爲五千五百元、卽因金號銀號兩帮首售、跌達五千四百二十元、中賴散戶低價撈進之心頓萌、時被拉起五十元、終以錢兌業亦來吐塞、重又撳落、午收五千四百三十元、午後開時人心惡劣、銀號曾有吸收五千四百十元開盤、反漲二十元、嗣以金號錢兌業散戶多頭一致作當日了結之舉、致收盤前慘進五千四百元關內、見五千三百五十元低價、收盤卒爲五千四百元、較上日尚軋小一百元、全天交易的三千兩光景、銀樓飾金掛小十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤昨軋跌一百元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以匯市報平、形勢尚穩、開市與上日未分榮辱、銀號互做十兩、仍爲五千五百元、繼因銀號帮競向吐出、金號亦跟之拋塞、且斯時匯市報硬、進戶缺少、遂壓低八十元、金號出銀號二十兩、遜爲五千四百二十元、旋賴證券帮錢兌業及散戶拖進、曾回升五十元、銀號進金號三十兩、爲五千四百七十元、卒因外匯仍走鬆勢、見高賣者頗多、某銀號吐售尤力、復又撳小五十五元、錢兌業對做十兩、爲五千四百十五元、收盤前賣風稍戢、重見回高十五元、錢兌業進金號十兩、爲五千四百三十元、作午收價、午後開時頗疲、一撳二十元、證券帮出錢兌業十兩、退爲五千四百十元、繼乃銀號帮搜入、回漲二十元、銀號進證券帮二十兩、爲五千四百三十元、後以外匯報硬引起賣風、金號錢兌業互相吐出、銀號帮多頭隨之脫手、遂又降落八十元、銀號出錢兌業二十兩、爲五千三百五十元、入後賣戶减少、某銀號納胃甚健、又來加碼吸收、遂回升六十元、金號出銀號二十兩、爲五千四百十元、後證券幫出銀號等三十兩、復退為五千四百元、晚收價、結果比上日軋跌一百元、全天一百五十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開</p>

<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸五百六十元、迨午後三時十五分掛小十元、計大同行改懸五百五十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣下跌</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤盤旋下落、英美金鎊因亦各跌三元、英金票以黑市英匯又趨鬆硬、各方供給稍旺、價乃趨跌三角、美金票因黑市美匯步長、大衆羣起傾售、市價步落、一度退至十六元二角半、卒稍回上至十六元三角、比上日仍軋跌二角七分、香港票跌後又漲、卒告續漲二分、坎拿大票及菲列濱票仍不乏供給、市價一致續疲、日金票需要未减、晚市爲一元一角、朝鮮票供求均勻、晚市仍爲九角七分半、</p>
<h3>明日銀行半年決算　票據交換延長</h3>
<p>上海銀行業聯合準備委員會、昨日通函各交換銀行略云、「查六月二十九日（星期六）爲銀行業半年決算之期、本會為便利同業收解起見、特將是日交換時間酌予延遲、定爲下午四時四十五分起、至代收票據時間、仍照舊辦理、」按原來交換時間爲下午三點半、計延遲一時一刻、</p>
<h3>證券　內債形勢轉機　丙種已穿出五十元關　英商銀行股頻跌不已</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市價、突起上峯、某銀行買進數十萬、驟使萎疲債市、爲之一振、某項空氣濃厚、交易因此亦猛增、市上籌碼頓見枯竭、一般散戶頗有補空、俱大戶空頭則仍屹然不動、此種漲風、憑藉付息相近及銀行半年決算關係爲多、所謂某種空氣、依然捕風捉影之談耳、昨日上午永豐號代某銀行買進丙戊兩種的三十萬左右、市氣頓堅、戊種因二十號多頭出籠、故漲而無力、永康供出甲種的十萬、爲樂茂所吸收、餘如聯益及十六號稍有需要、爲聯和賣出、午後丙戊兩種交易較多、故漲勢忽轉有力、甲種賣戶最少、故漲勢亦猛、市價已衝出六十一元、丙種亦穿出五十元、形勢甚佳、但未能預卜其有無繼續能力耳、市價結果、除丁種仍未開出外、餘均好起二角至三角半、成交的計一百萬元以上、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易成交康元製罐廠股三十股、每股價爲九元正、按此種股票、票面爲十元正、</p>
<p>衆業公所股市、經營者興趣仍甚淡薄、價格變動至微、成交稀少、</p>
<p>倫敦二十六日（週三）電、今日遠東英商各公司股票、掛牌行市、銀行股步跌不已、其餘尚平、麥加利銀行股續跌二先令六便士、價爲六鎊、滙豐銀行股猛落五鎊、英倫註冊股爲五十五鎊、香港註册股爲六十鎊、有利銀行股跌五先令、價爲十一鎊五先令、</p>
<p>倫敦二十六日（週三）電、今日中國外債掛牌行市、仍告平穩、上下檔各債券概無變動、</p>
<h3>紗花　獨力難支　紗價慘跌　雙馬最低八八五元</h3>
<p>紗市先平後跌、趨勢依然衰弱、此因實際銷路不暢、滬方運輸、仍有困難、所以港帮束手不辦、人心不振、因此申新廠雖在市竭力維持、繼續收進、然賣者非常擁擠、該廠鑒於獨力不能支大厦、乃停止不收、由此價九百五十元之限價、直跌至八百八十五元、旋以稍有買進、回至九百元邊口矣、</p>
<p>現紗晨開人氣已渙散、賣者多而買者少、二十支雙馬喊價爲九百四十七元、大家相持未成交、少頃申新廠有人在市塲叫九百五十元收進、於是賣者紛至沓來、額子均係五十包以外、該廠視檯面上籌碼充牣、亦束手不收、散戶有吐出、市價一脫、跌至八百六十五元、但收盤較有人收進、又回升至九百元、查半日間成交統計二千二百四十包、行情雙馬跌六十六元、今日有紗二百八十三件運烟台、一百零五件運天津、十件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如後、</p>
<h3>棉花日廠稍動</h3>
<p>現棉完全入於停頓之途、實緣紗市下跌殊巨、以致廠家觀望、所以本棉交易絕跡、然有一部極願猛跌遷就、然吃客寥寥也、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐的棉市、殊爲堅定、且活躍異常、現貨商及華爾街之購買、結果收盤價格較之上日近期漲十九磅音、遠期漲十磅音、印度棉市連同預測無甚軒輊、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、華方廠商殊見靜寂、然日廠却殊活躍、昨日搜購現貨約千餘包、但　款期則大都爲七月底、良以日紗價高、及紗銷活躍之故也、同業之心意、因此又轉見良好矣、</p>
<p>印棉又有大批到滬、前日鴨家輪船公司薩蓆亞號（譯音）輪抵埠、由喀爾喀塔運來棉六千件、停靠浦東其昌棧起卸、</p>
<h3>紗廠黃金時代的沒落</h3>
<p>— 島客</p>
<p>誰都知道，近兩月前，廿支紗的最高峰，曾有過一千八九百元（每件的破天荒的新紀錄。投機朋友們，拚命抬高紗價，以爲手中有了幾件紗，可以無事不威風，大有一生吃着不盡之概，更何愁不會團團作富家翁，其適爲紗廠做犧牲品，適爲紗廠業造暴利機會，一千八九百元以及一千六七百元的市價時，紗廠方面的花本和開銷總成本，僅千元左右，（這是指的雙馬紗，其他的紗，亦不相上下吧？）那麼每件紗，不是有八九百元或六七百元的暴利所得嗎，可是道種暴利的機會，却像閃電式的過去了！五月中旬，外匯猛長，而歐戰聯軍不利的消息，又頻頻而來，印度花美棉等電訊，跌勢甚烈，（利於空方的海外多頭賣出）於是上海紗市，從一千四五百元，而一千二三百元，而一千一百元左右，而……到昨天（廿七日）竟以海防無法轉運的惡耗而一跌再跌，初開雙馬紗九百五十元光景，繼而跌到八百五六十元之門，最後收盤，始大跌小回頭的做到八百八十元，一跌總是近百元的出入，雖然有某大紗廠展開雄厚的魄力，有出而收買雙馬紗三四千包，維持市價之說，（這可見紗廠內在恐慌的嚴重性，）然而老於商塲者的目光，在現實環境下，總能看到跌多漲少，利於空而不利於多，何况實際上。香港帮等銷路，零落得可憐，（日僅一二百包）據日往紗市塲的某君告記者，昨天（廿七日）市塲上的奇蹟，謂港帮非但不辦進，反而陸續吐售，這樣紗價的脚地，和紗市的前途，也就可想而知了！</p>
<p>照目前八百幾十元的紗價，紗廠方面要虧蝕到每件兩百多元之鉅，紗廠方面的原料－棉花－大都早就進足的，（高便時買進的）統扯廿支紗的花本每担須在二百三四十元左右，照用花三百五十斤算，花本就須八百三四十元，再加上每件紗開銷至少一百七八十元，兩項相加，自己的製造成本，就須千元外了，大紗廠每日夜出紗（廿支）兩百件的話，就須虧蝕三寓元左右了，照這樣紗市的跌風達一個月，大範圍而擁有雄厚公積金的大紗廠，月虧百萬元或者還可應付？（說不定也將感到捉襟見肘吧？）至於許多小範圍紗廠，只好關門大吉了，據某君告我，某大紗廠在原料（棉花）和市價的暴跌中，已虧蝕到五百萬元之鉅了，而一屆本月底交割期，紗號的倒閉和淸算的，恐更將有驚人的數字吧！</p>
<h3>糧食　囤戶出籠　米價繼跌元許</h3>
<p>米市昨日初開因賣方自前朝甩低後、不肯再事輕脫、在扳持下形勢較堅、各色洋米價曾喊高半元有奇、何如銷塲不爽、除內地幫又告停頓外、其鄉莊及本街去路悉鮮問津、致轉瞬復趨平伏、兼之一般浮囤散戶無意再守、頗多出籠、加之新到一萬五六千包外、前定各批亦將相繼抵申、而本路消化旣淡、內地幫亦以搬運證將决足額、新證費昂不划通運、且連日天雨、人心已平、內地米價早已步下、新囤戶亦已不敢再事吸收、雖尚有一部份行囤心思甚堅、然以趨勢而論、後市或將被逼下降也、昨各米售價一致盤下、二號西貢早市尚開六十一元、晚收祇六十元零二角半、二號暹米早六十元零五角、晚五十九元半、小絞早六十元零三角、晚五十九元四角、比之前晚均小一元左右、回籠貨新交易停頓、回籠二號暹米十八號裝一百五十噸、價開六十七元半至六十七元三角、現米開出五千多包、</p>
<p>粳糯國米、來源因前日終朝　雨、未有抵埠、而銷塲方面、無論明暗盤傳聞俱屬不暢、惟貨主以貨無到、心思頗堅、致結果形成定局、售盤悉與前相仿、</p>
<h3>麪粉祇銷本街　小麥產價　得雨而降</h3>
<p>麪粉交易、頗不寂寞、但祇本街零星實銷、蓋以目下米價昂貴、平民之需用頻增、切麪業公會、要求增加供給、聞廠方已經接受、全日間兩廠配出的計一萬四五千包、二號粉廠盤續開十四元七角、回籠貨價在十五元四五角、日廠期粉已開過十六元六角、又麪粉今日有一千二百包、運往烟台、</p>
<p>新小麥來源、續有京蕪蕪帶運到三四千包、但均非正式來貨、華商運輸問題、迄今尚無切實解決、惟天時得雨後、產價雖已報小、而捐費雜用則有增無減、故新麥價格、仍須二十三元半至二十四元以上、又聞阜豐廠辦進鎭江麥五六百包、價爲二十四元三角云、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆底枯　豆餅益俏</h3>
<p>昨日豆餅市况、在晨初雖因天雨、然搬運困難、實銷尚少湧旺去路、故市面無甚大變化、入後一般行囤戶查悉黃豆底積奇枯、來源又不接、致乃盡力拖進、市價益形俏俐、結果再騰躍三角、不過現貨供缺、大都訂期交易、廠方因人心有看到十四五元之未來高價、故亦不敢過拋、昨統計成交大有四牌餅一萬四五千張、現貨價爲十三元五六角、訂七月上半月交價爲十三元三角至六角、甡記餅五千張、現貨價爲十二元九角至十三元、七月上交十三元一角、元隆餅八車現貨價爲十二元七角至十三元、七月上交亦爲十三元、肥字餅七車、現貨價爲十三元、七月上交爲十三元一角、及靑中餅一千張、價爲十二元一角半、</p>
<p>昨有生油一千八百五十二聽、又二百八十件由烟台運到、靑島來者的二百件、又豆油五百九十件、今日裝往香港生油五百聽、豆餅二千塊、豆子七百九十五包、</p>
<h3>疋頭　西南交通受阻　棉布客銷驟淸</h3>
<p>國布昨日布市以人心虛弱、售盤先穩繼跌、實銷仍以本街及蘇浙皖各游擊區爲較旺、西南粵滇帮去貨銳减、售盤粗細布斜紋每疋跌五角至一元、漂染布亦跌價一元左右、溫甬台帮辦粗斜紋色布一百餘件、蘇杭皖南北各游擊區辦藍布粗布色斜等貨一萬餘疋、本街辦各種坯布、漂染布二萬餘疋、囤戶逢廉亦稍有吸收、</p>
<p>東布因紗價續跌、人心益虛、同業求售殷切、而買戶寥落、故龍頭細布晨開卅一元三角、卽步降至卅元〇五角、後市塲外卅元做起、猛跌至廿八元七角半、中閒起伏大跌小回、形勢尚難站定、四君子嗶嘰一度提升至九角、終以實銷不振、後市收盤回至八角四分五厘、</p>
<p>另訊疋頭及棉紗、近日客帮銷路之呆滯、茲據航業界消息、北洋帮客胃停滯、因天津日僞對於疋頭棉紗進口、將於七月一日起統制、南華帮見近越南問題緊張、故皆停止採辦、因此出口大見减少、</p>
<p>出口今日有疋頭、二百二十八件、運往烟台、又四十八件、運往天津、又十七件、運往香港、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗白步鬆</h3>
<p>昨情市趨勢軟弱、　見髤落、公會劃盤現貨二四粗白、外棧初爲六十八元五角至二角、後又小至六十八元、前後降去六角、轉口七月二日交貨五十四元九角至五十五元、小三角、卽打棧單者五十四元半、小二角、太古車白較平、B嘜仍七十九元半、荷赤五十九元四角、國糖有廣東幫開出、高海南赤七十包、五十一元半、餘乏成交、</p>
<h3>前胡到申</h3>
<p>前胡產於浙徽交界叢山中、爲夏秋間治病要藥、去冬因天時人事關係、產額僅及往年之半、採運亦因之十分困難、聞白克路裕記申莊在春間曾派員至產地辦到全額十之七八、共頭二帮已運香港、轉銷南洋羣島、茲到有各檔現貨存棧待沽云、</p>

<h3>高麗參</h3>
<p>高麗自臣服本朝後，例定每年內三朝五貢，嗣因往返頻煩，着併朝貢為一次。其來京也，有使臣八人，為首者卽貢使，餘則有二大人至八大人名目，大約卽副使與隨員耳。除貢方物外，所與中國交易者，以高麗參為大宗，每包約十觔，祇凖與京師內六大行家買賣，再由此六行分運各省府州縣之藥肆，中國商民固不能私與貿易，卽高麗之商民，亦不得帶參私自出關。其參自交與六大行家後，並不收價，必另有淸單，託此六行代辦中國之綢緞紗羅，與夫筆墨等貨物，次年來京，彼此再行核算，舊例如是也。去年直隸督臣，因高麗之商民，入境售參，移咨到部。當由部臣查得高麗貢使，隨帶一切貨物，雖例免稅，却祇應在人同四譯館等處，開市交易，不得携往內地銷售，惟每有邊民，假冒高麗人，應由地方官究辦，如果實係貢使從人，私往內地逗遛係貢使從人，私往內地逗遛，則須解部，轉送本國查辦也。</p>

<h3>升學的幾個要點　—貢獻給高中畢業的學同學—</h3>
<p>— 錢家駿</p>
<p>上星期三下午，往靜安寺路女青年會聽了二小時的升學指導的演講。這一天是由東吳大學教務主任王先生主講，他的井井有條的說明，對於我們升學的選擇方面的確得益匪淺。我覺得女青年會這次舉辦的升學講座，不啻是我們高中將畢業的一羣的一盞明燈，它指示了我們各人所應走的路。但是近日各學校的畢業生大都在準備畢業考試，爲了時間關係，或者不能去聽一下，所以我來把王先生所講的大略寫在下面，給各校未能去聽講的同學們參考。</p>
<p>「在暑期到臨以前，各中學校照例都要指導學生畢業后的升學問題，好似為將要待嫁的女兒去選擇一個合於個人性情相近的夫家（即大學）。現在你們又快要出娘家了，同時我們大學當局也要忙碌地預備迎娶你們一羣新媳婦。」開首王先生就用這句幽默的比喻，襯出了升學指導的重要性。然後將下面分成四點來說：</p>
<p>（一）學習社會需要的技能</p>
<p>誰都不會否認，當中國獲得最後勝利的一天，也就是建設開始的一天；換句話說：要從抗戰后的灰燼中建築起一個新中國來。那時亟需大批的技術人員，自不待書。所以選擇學習的科目，最好是社會較需要的技能。那末無輪在個人的出路和國家的利益上面講，都是一舉兩得。</p>
<p>（二）配合本人智力和興趣</p>
<p>唯其是建設人才的需要，大部門青年學生為着將來能替國家更積極的服務起見，以致充滿了「投考理工科」的呼聲。然而有些人根本不會想到自己教學常常會Zero　mark，或者物理是吃慣「鴨蛋」，縱使勉強考取，讀了一個學期便會覺得吃不消而轉系了。這種麻煩都是由錯誤觀念的結果，因為其他如文法商諸科也各有其價值，祗要合於自己才能與興趣，一定有美滿的效果，比「捉住牛頭吃馬草」是好得多了</p>
<p>（三）選擇學校的學系</p>
<p>在美國，有專家把全國大學詳細地調查過，製定各校何科最優良，何科較差的統計表，俾預備投考大學者可一目瞭然。中國尚沒有這種統計，現在祗有憑我們自己調查，切不可抱定亂考主義而輕視這個重要問題。</p>
<p>（四）注意學校的環境和校風</p>
<p>環境是學校的軀殼；校風是學校的靈魂。因為學校是學生訓練智力，鍛煉體格和人格修養的所在，故必須有優良的環境，才有較佳的造就。關於校風，例如同學間感情是否融洽，教職員與學生是否和衷共濟，這些都能左右學生的學業。</p>
<p>其他如學校是否立案；以前畢業生出路如何；以及校中的設備等等，王先生都一一詳細的指導，爲了篇幅關係，恕我這裏不多寫了。末後，我希望各位同學榜上有名。</p>
<h3>求職業的九戒</h3>
<p>— 良</p>
<p>當你一旦給你渴慕已久欲謀一面的店主召見去談話的時候，你須切記注意下列九點：</p>
<p>（一）不要露出惶悚莫名或極其忙亂的樣子。</p>
<p>（二）講話之聲浪不必過高，也不要過快，以免擾亂了你的聖經。</p>
<p>（三）莫把你所有的困難，全部完全傾告於他。</p>
<p>（四）莫談論毫無關係的閑話。</p>
<p>（五）莫說得過詳，致惹起對方的厭惡。</p>
<p>（六）莫詢問一些糊塗問題。</p>
<p>（七）莫對店主說：「我定能努力工作。」</p>
<p>（八）莫對店主說，如果用了你，他會得到很大的好處。</p>
<p>（九）不要想法支配對方。（譯自世界文摘三四月號）</p>
<h3>「日光節約」聲中的剝削者</h3>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>我是××織染廠的一個工人，每晨六時上工，下午六時放工，每天足足勞苦着十二小時，所得的代價，最多也不過九角一天。試想在這百物飛漲的大都市中，除扣去膳費五角以及所需雜支外，剩下有幾？</p>
<p>最近因市面稍覺清淡，廠方將夜工停止，一張佈告，就辭退了三十多個男女工，社會上又新添上一批失業者，我慶幸自己未被裁去，然而一切苛刻的待遇，也足夠消受了。</p>
<p>六月一號起，各處遵行日光節約，我們廠裏也不能例外，本來十二小時牛馬工作，已夠勞苦，現在平白地又加上一個鐘頭的工作，要做到十三個小時的工作。編輯先生，這所謂是實行日光節約的原理嗎？因此我借貴刊批露，希望資方顧全我們工人們的健康及生活，救救我們勞苦的大衆吧！</p>
<p>（編者按：本月一日實行新鐘點后，會接到一位讀者來信，他認為這「運動」一點沒有意義，除了便宜了二房東之外。他的例子是：二房東已遵照新鐘十二時熄火了。關於「日光節約」運動的意義，本刊已有好幾位作者發表意見，不再贅述。本市的大二房東，在戰後眞是無孔不入，這個絕好的機會，自然不肯輕易放過。不過晚上是睡眠的時間，早一小時熄火不像加租那樣有損於三房客，所以那封來信沒有發表。但昨天又接到一位工友的來信，他工作的那織染廠廠主也藉此機會，增加工友的工作時間，這不但不合當局的提倡「日光節約」運動的眞義，而竟從事剝削工友的休息時間，這眞是太「那個」了。這封信的發表，明知對於工友們沒有什麽幫助的，但是是有生命的人類，總具備着人類應有的同情心的，萬一因之而發生細微的效果，我代全體工人祝該廠生意興隆。）</p>

<p>霍桑又點點頭。「你從床上起來以後又怎麼樣？」</p>
<p>「我馬上披了一件衣裳，就去敲隔室李老爺的門。他也驚醒了。他開了門，我就陪著他下樓來。我們一走進這會客室，便瞧見王小姐這種可怕的樣子。」伊的視線又一度接觸那屍體。</p>
<p>霍桑從嘴裏拿下了紙烟，問道：「那時候這會客室的門開著還是關着？」</p>
<p>「開着。因為我記得一走下樓梯，便瞧見這裏的燈光照在外面的甬道中。」</p>
<p>「這窗呢？」他用手向書桌面前的鋼條窗指了一指。</p>
<p>「也開着，還是這個樣子。」</p>
<p>「好，以後怎麼樣？」</p>
<p>「李老爺着了慌，說要打電話報告警署。我也沒有主意。那時看門的老毛也披了一件衣裳從外面進來。他站在正門口的石級上，忽而大聲呼叫！」</p>
<p>「呼叫什麽？」</p>
<p>「他喊着『脚印！脚印！』我跟着李老爺回到外面甬道中，瞧見老毛已把正門口的電燈開亮，正指着門裏面地板上的泥脚印發怔。李老爺叫老毛進來。他先搖搖頭不肯，接着他回進門房中去拿了幾塊鋪板，鋪蓋在足印上面，才從木板上小心地一步一步走進來。」</p>
<p>倪金壽本來拿了記事冊在默默地記寫，聽到這裏，仿佛已耐不住靜默，他停了筆自言自語地說：「奇怪，這老毛怎麼會把這泥脚印看得這樣重要？」</p>
<p>金梅忽自動地回答。「他大概已經知道王小姐已被人打死。因為李老爺走進來的時候，會驚惶地亂叫：『哎呦！誰打死伊的？誰打死伊的？』老毛一定在外面聽得了。」</p>
<p>霍桑並不下什麽批評，但催促金梅說下去。　（二八）</p>
<h3>紹興通訊</h3>
<p>— 竹厂</p>
<p>××兄：這確是淒慘的一幕，自從蕭山淪陷後，故鄉也會一度遭侵略者的蹂躪，雖不過是曇花一現，但因此浙贛路交通遭斷絕，米糧來源漸感缺乏。本來是要仰給外來的米糧作為民食的紹興，本地的生產當然不足供人民的需求，於是米價一漲再漲，直到百十元一石，如今民不聊生，餓斃日衆，又加數月不雨，河道見底，田地龜裂，疫瘟亦因之橫行。居民個個憔悴不堪，近處鄰居的死耗，已是一日不能或缺的新開。要是你現在回來的話，你一定會疑心這已不是昔日的故鄉：鑑湖那秀美的景色，平靜的胡波，已成為飢民的聚淚泉；會稽山麓的蘭亭，已不是當初莊嚴絢爛的名勝，牠們的四週像已蒙上了一層險黯的愁雲，想不到這越王臥薪嘗膽的故園，竟會變成人間的地獄。近聞申地熱心諸公為桑梓奔走勸募，此間同胞興奮異常，彼此渴待之可憐情景，眞令人心酸涕零，望旅滬越人士速起急救。</p>

<h3>未來電影的趨勢　彩片盛行黑白片淘汰</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>近年來由於五彩片產量的遞增，我們可以知道在未來的電影史上，黑白影片又將被淘汰，這是無疑的。好萊塢規模較大的影片公司，莫不集中其全部力量，用以攝製各種五彩片，無論是那些內容平凡或結構並不緊湊的片子，聰明的電影商人已一致認為如果渲染了色彩後，比較祗有黑白畫面映在銀幕上的，更能迎合觀衆的心理。</p>
<p>當初，電影事業由無聲時代進步到有聲時代的時候，固然，有一批人是發掘了，可是，另有一批人却就因此而在銀幕上隱息起來。在未來黑白影片的地位由五彩影片來代替時，準會發生同樣的遭遇的。現在，好萊塢的一般明星，正就爲了這個問題而已感到了恐懼；他們或她們都在憂慮着自己的地位可曾跟着這種趨勢而就此動搖麼？</p>
<p>其實，上面所說的情形，在好萊塢是已經有所聽到了。大家已承認拍五彩片與演員們皮膚的關係是極大的；此外，另有一種論調，認為褐色皮膚的演員拍五彩片較白色皮膚的爲適宜。派拉蒙公司本年度預備開攝的五彩片共有五張，其中四張的主演者即由褐色皮膚的演員來擔任，另外一張是由西席地密爾導演的“Northwest　Mounted　Police”主角爲瑪黛琳卡洛兒，才是一位白色皮膚的明星。</p>
<p>五彩片的佔據整個電影事業的期間，離今日是不會很遠的了。所以，各界的輿論亦在預測不久後銀壇上又將有一番大大的變動了，我們且拭目而待着吧。最後，順便談及幾句關於影片的洗片工作，據聞，黑片所用的是一種棕黃色的液體及粉劑；用的量是極多的，但與影片本身絕對不會發生損傷；五彩片用的是另一種灰色的粉劑，並且祗能用少量才行</p>
<h3>張翼鵬　改良皮黃劇</h3>
<p>— 沈琪</p>
<p>青年皮黃劇從業員張翼鵬，自脫離大舞台後思想突變，感到生存在這個大時代中，戲劇並不是一種單純的娛樂作用，而該擔負文化上本位的使命，所以戰戰兢兢演出非常鄭重。在這一年中，他同着他的二弟二鵬，除了聘請程小青君教授國學以補不足的知識外，尤努力於皮黃劇改良運動，譬如編寫劇本，就是其中一項，目下「文天祥」一劇已經殺青，繼續搜集「林沖」的資料。據他表示：在這過渡期中，藝術該與思想並重，因為思想可以教育觀衆，藝術則可爭取觀衆欣賞的趣味。</p>
<p>但是，使他認為問題者，劇場主人是否能夠接受他的主張？因此，在他暫時息影家園，期待着一個地盤來讓他能夠操縱前後台的一切。</p>
<p>最近，卡爾登預備下月八日起，開始歇夏，因為目下移風社在卡爾登，前後台確是統一計劃的，這正是迎合他的理想，所以他想乘他們在歇夏期中，預備租借下來，出演他的新皮黃劇，以作觀衆是否可以接受的嘗試。不過，如果卡爾登僅祗歇夏一個月，那他祗有作為罷論的，因為無論如何，當此酷熱的夏天出演，失敗是當然的，至少也該過了六月才夠發揮。</p>

<h3>壽雲壺齋曲話　答客問西廂俗語</h3>
<p>— 林少卿</p>
<p>日前吾在本刊談秋胡戲妻，中有解釋元代秋胡戲妻曲子中語，引起董君來函問西廂記中語句，董君有不明之處，命吾解注明白，吾不敏，於元曲中語，祗略知一二，僅照來函舉，漫答於次，不知有當否　一，「挽弓逗緣」緣乃緣字之　，此句出在驚艷折前金聖嘆之總批中，乃聖嘆學作元人語，挽弓者，指張生也，如今人說張字爲弓長，至今北方江湖人切口，糊張姓者爲「灣弓子，」其來源從元人語「挽弓」血出，可以證也。聖嘆批云，「爲挽弓逗緣，」言此別院必附於寺中者，爲張生巧逗姻緣，因游寺乃得見鶯鶯也，因此一句，害得找連金批全文看了一遍，始尋着這句，苦矣。二，「挽弓」酸俫，在「前候，」紅娘唱中語，董君脫一俫字，挽弓二字既明，今解酸俫二字，元代人稱小童爲「俫兒」由窮讀書人常被呼爲「酸丁，」「酸丁」爲讀書人之或壯或老之統稱，「酸俫」則指年青者也，「挽弓酸俫」解以今語，則是張家窮酸小子也。三，「鶻佁湪老，」湪老眼也，今北方江湖切口，呼眼爲「招兒，」意正同；鶻伶是形容詞，眼大而有光，目爲雙眼皮而俊美者，謂爲鶻伶的，北人今誇女人眼美，仍用此二字，但鶻本音胡，今北人讀如虎，稍不同矣。四，「聖賢打，」打是打起黃鶯兒之打，劉寶全唱大鼓戰長沙或軍刀會，稱關壯繆爲聖賢爺，此之聖賢亦然，元人凡一切神仙皆稱之曰聖賢，不止關公，「好教聖賢打者，張生恨日頭遲落，應教神仙如后羿之類，打他下去也；打字是湊韻腳聖賢」字係偶爾相連。五，「紗窗也沒有紅娘報，」此句易明，吾記得紅娘是烏名，此是雙關語，烏名恰與人名同，遂用之，借何詩典故，請董君自己用用腦筋，查考可也。元曲爲一切戲曲之母，其中詞句，多與現代不同，吾極喜鑽研，凡喜　曲者，皆可下一番工夫，可能找出許多趣味，如考古家往埃及古墓，發現「木乃伊」之艷屍，不亦樂哉！</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Demands Romania Return Bessarabia; Ultimatum Expires Last Night; Rumor Has It Romanian Government Decided to Accept</h3>
<p>Rome. According to a Bucharest dispatch from the official Stefani News Agency, Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov has delivered an ultimatum to Romania, demanding the immediate return of Bessarabia and the northern region of Bukovina bordering Poland, and giving Romania until tonight to respond. (United Press, June 27th)</p>
<p>Bucharest. Authoritative sources this afternoon say Romania has decided to accept the Soviet demands. The Soviet Union delivered an ultimatum demanding the return of Bessarabia and the northern part of the Bukovina province, and control of the ports of Constanta and Tulcea, with a deadline of 10 PM tonight for a response. (Associated Press, June 27th)</p>
<p>Berlin. A German government spokesperson stated that Germany's attitude towards Romania is the same as its attitude towards the Baltic states: Germany will neither offer advice nor participate in any arbitration. (Associated Press, June 27th)</p>
<p>Berlin. The land demanded by the Soviet Union from Romania has a population of three million people and covers 4,030 square miles. In 1934, Romania guaranteed the integrity of the Soviet Union's western border territories, and the Soviet Union ceased demanding the return of Bessarabia and Bukovina. (Associated Press, June 27th)</p>
<p>London. The Italian news agency published news from the Romanian capital, stating that the Soviet government has demanded that the Romanian government return Bessarabia and northern Bukovina. This news has not yet been officially confirmed. It stated that Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov invited the Romanian ambassador for talks yesterday and made this request, giving them until tonight to respond. Soviet aircraft are now flying over Romanian territory, causing great shock in Romanian political circles. The official German news agency also published this news received from the Romanian capital, stating that the ultimatum expires at 10 PM today. The agency also published news from the Hungarian capital, stating that the Romanian Crown Council has reportedly decided to accept the demands. (Reuters, June 27th)</p>
<p>Bucharest. Romanian King Carol convened a Crown Council this afternoon, but the content of the discussion is unclear. Political figures speculate that the discussion concerns extremely important issues. (Haitong Telegraph, June 27th)</p>
<p>Bucharest. Romanian government authorities notified Romanian Airlines last night that all air services passing through eastern Romania must be suspended. It is rumored that the government's motive is related to military affairs, as there are many fortresses on Romania's eastern border, and aircraft passing through would hinder the maintenance of military secrets. (Haitong Telegraph, June 27th)</p>
<p>Berlin. Authoritative sources here recently stated that well-informed sources in Bucharest say the Soviet Union has delivered an ultimatum to Romania, but the Romanian government refuses to confirm this news. News from Bucharest arriving in Berlin today says the Soviet Union demands the return of Bessarabia, a rich oil-producing region, which was Russian territory before 1919. It is also rumored that the Soviet Union demands the return of the northern part of Bukovina, a former Austrian province. (Associated Press, June 27th)</p>
<h3>German-Soviet Border Treaty Negotiations Begin; Soviet Representative Arrives in Berlin</h3>
<p>Berlin. Alexander Livshitz, Director of the Western European Department of the Soviet Foreign Commissariat, along with Colonel Lyutikov, arrived in Berlin yesterday to begin negotiations on the German-Soviet border treaty. Those welcoming them at the station included Minister Su Geng, Counselor Schlieper of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Soviet Ambassador to Germany Shkvartsev, among others. (Haitong News Agency, June 27th)</p>
<h3>United States Simultaneously Attends to Situations in Europe and Asia; Most Warships Still Remain in Hawaii</h3>
<p>Philadelphia. According to well-informed American sources, it is difficult to say whether Washington is more concerned about the situation in Europe or the Far East. Currently, there is not much news available from the State Department and the White House, but it is understood that both places attach great importance to both regions. Non-official circles are comparing Japan's actions and threats of continued action with Mussolini's actions, which he believes can be safely carried out. If Japan overturns the status quo in the Pacific, it is difficult to predict what the United States will do. The deployment of the U.S. Pacific Fleet remains shrouded in mystery both here and in Honolulu. Although some warships have sailed towards the Panama Canal, it is generally believed that most warships will remain in Hawaiian waters or points east. According to political observers, most people believe that the U.S. fleet has been stationed in the central Pacific for so long to prepare for the possibility of the situation that is currently unfolding. American attention is multifaceted, including the possibility of huge losses in trade with China, maintaining the independence of the Philippines, maintaining the supply of rubber, tin, and tungsten from the Far East, and America's general condemnation of aggression and refusal to recognize territorial changes caused by force. Some political observers believe that if the government does not gradually become completely isolationist (there is no indication of this at present), then if the threats implied in General Toshiroku's declaration are carried out, American action is almost inevitable. The Republican Convention's complete disregard for reality is evident in the party platform, which ignores even the situation that seriously threatens American interests and the American defense program, in which rubber plays an important role. (Reuters, June 27th)</p>
<p>New York. American newspapers are speculating about the secret whereabouts of the U.S. fleet after it departed from the Hawaiian Islands. It is generally believed that the fleet is heading towards the Panama Canal, and it will take at least ten days to arrive. Because the gun emplacements along the American coast have been strengthened, and there are rumors that minefields have been laid at both entrances to the Panama Canal, the subtle clues are thought-provoking. Some believe that if the U.S. fleet sails to the Atlantic, President Roosevelt may have the idea of ​​occupying French colonies in South America and the West Indies, or have the intention of seizing Dakar from Germany, because if Germany and Italy can control the French navy, the naval strength of the Axis powers will be greatly enhanced. (Haitong Telegraph, June 27th)</p>
<h3>British Troops Continue Activities on Libyan Border; Italian Airfield in Africa Attacked</h3>
<p>Cairo. General Headquarters issued an "unofficial" statement stating that yesterday, British patrols in front of Libya continued their activities in the coastal areas of Sidi Aziz and Bardia, and south to the grassy savanna of Qarah Babr. The Qarah Babr British patrol advanced northwest along the desert road leading to the coastal area. It is now confirmed that Italian aircraft bombed the Mosamma Matruh area on Sunday. No British troops were injured, but three Egyptian soldiers were killed and eighteen wounded. A steel and concrete air-raid shelter was hit by a bomb within six feet, but the shelter was unaffected. (Reuters, June 27th)</p>
<p>Cairo. An official bulletin announced that yesterday morning, British Air Force bombers raided Italian airfields and military targets in Africa, with great effect. British aircraft attacked and heavily damaged Italian aircraft hangars. When the British aircraft were returning after completing their mission, they engaged in combat with enemy fighters for thirty minutes, resulting in the shooting down of one enemy aircraft, and another seemed to have lost control. All British aircraft returned safely to their base. In addition, British Blenheim aircraft bombed the Magaca airfield and gasoline depots, hitting several bombs, but the extent of the damage is unknown. Military targets in Asaba were also attacked by British aircraft. Yesterday, Malta was bombed by enemy aircraft five times, resulting in several Indian casualties and very minor damage. British aircraft flew into enemy territory for reconnaissance and obtained valuable photographs. All British aircraft returned safely. (Reuters, June 27th)</p>
<h3>Duke of Windsor Leaves Madrid</h3>
<p>Madrid. The Duke of Windsor and his entourage drove towards Portugal by car yesterday morning. It is said that Windsor requested to stay in Spain for three more days, but was refused by the Spanish authorities. (Haitong Telegraph, June 27th)</p>
<h3>British Military Strength is Strong and Victory is Assured; Broadcast Speech by Secretary of War Eden</h3>
<p>London. Secretary of War Eden broadcast last night expressing his complete conviction that Britain would be able to repel German attacks, stating in brief: Germany has already destroyed the free fortresses around Britain and will soon attack our land. Enemy air raids will continue, and the enemy may use other methods of attack, but they will be repelled, and we will also make the enemy frequently suffer aerial counterattacks within their own territory. We know well that our countrymen will never retreat. From the tragic fate of France, we have learned that civilization cannot be preserved by material methods alone. Steel and concrete bunkers are not enough; only by mobilizing the spirit and will of the entire nation can we achieve final victory. At this time of danger, the fiber of our national organization will be put to a difficult test, but we also know in our hearts that there is a rare and great opportunity today: the British Empire now has the opportunity to independently defend, restore, and expand the scope of freedom in the future. Troops from all parts of the British Empire are now gathered in Britain. This is an amazing sight of the people of the Empire united for justice. The French nation, in its painful groaning, only hopes that we will preserve its precious civilization. If we and our overseas compatriots do not express our firm and unyielding will to preserve civilization, then this civilization will inevitably disappear from Europe. All those who are trampled under the enemy's iron heel are looking to our victory. How can we disappoint them? Eden strongly urged the people of the country not to panic each other when attacked, saying that the defeat of France was facilitated by the gathering of refugees. We British should take this as a warning. The enemy will soon know that sitting still and being bombed without resisting is not the nature of the British. We have an extremely strong air force that will inflict heavy damage on the enemy. Although our air force is fighting in unfavorable circumstances, it is still inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. Our air force often fights outnumbered. When the British army retreated from Dunkirk, our air force shot down as many as seventy enemy aircraft in one day. The combat of our air force in our own skies should be even better. If enemy aircraft occasionally sneak into British airspace and our aircraft do not engage them, then the people of the country should not angrily ask what our air force is doing. It must be known that our air force is repelling enemy aircraft a hundred miles away and protecting the factories, docks, ships, and airfields on which our national defense depends from damage. We now have a large number of aircraft, and the number is increasing daily, but we must use them where they can destroy the enemy most. The anti-aircraft guns placed all over our country and the barrage balloons that captured two enemy aircraft the night before are also things that our countrymen should not forget. I am not saying that the people of the country will not be bombed, but I can tell the people of the country that the fate of enemy aircraft is not enviable. We are now a fortress, but in the British Isles, it is useless to only be able to repel attacks. There are now 1.25 million soldiers in our country holding spears, and the arrival of new troops from Australia and New Zealand, and the return of British and Allied forces from France, have greatly increased our country's military strength to an unprecedented level. We firmly believe that we will be able to defeat any enemy troops attempting to land in Britain with sufficient troops. Tonight I speak with limited optimism. I know that we must face difficult days, but I also know that our abilities and spirit are sufficient to cope with any difficulties. Only adopting a defensive posture or counterattacking will never win the victory. There will be a day when we will attack the enemy, and at that time our countrymen will see us do it with all our strength. At present, we are already attacking and winning elsewhere. Our army in the Near East has been quite active with this spirit of attack. This is a good omen for the future. (Reuters, June 27th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>What Will Become of the French Navy?</h3>
<p>The armistice agreements between Germany and France, and between Italy and France, have been signed and established by both parties, have been officially announced, and are being implemented. The so-called Western Front war has come to an end. If the European war situation develops along the original straight line, then future battles will be, on the one hand, the German army's offensive against Britain; on the other hand, the war between Britain and Italy in the Mediterranean and Africa. We do not need to predict how the Second World War will be won or lost, but before deciding the outcome, there is an extremely important and very interesting issue that is currently difficult to understand but will be revealed soon, namely, what will become of the French Navy?</p>
<p>What do we mean by "what will become of"? If the French Navy follows the orders of the Petain government in Bordeaux, that is, in accordance with Article 8 of the German-French armistice agreement: "The French Navy, except for a small number protecting colonies overseas, should gather in designated ports and be disarmed under German and Italian supervision; Germany solemnly guarantees that, except for coastal defense and minesweeping, the French Navy will never be used for combat activities; therefore, France should recall all overseas warships except those maintaining the colonial empire." Also in accordance with Article 12 of the Italian-French armistice agreement: "The French naval fleet, except those permitted by the German and Italian governments to protect French colonies overseas, should gather in designated ports and be disarmed under German and Italian supervision; therefore, all French fleets overseas, except those maintaining colonial interests, should be recalled; the Italian government declares that it has no intention of using the French Navy in combat during the war; it also has no demands on the French Navy after the peace agreement; but during the armistice period, the Italian government reserves the right to use the French fleet to carry out minesweeping work." This is one attitude the French Navy could take. Another attitude the French Navy could take is, regardless of whether the so-called French Provisional National Committee in London is formed or not, to remain on the same battle line with the British fleet and continue to fight against Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>Originally, the French Navy ranked fourth in the world. Germany and Italy are no match for France, outside of Britain, the United States, and Japan. Let's make a simple table for comparison:</p>
<p>Country Number of Ships Tonnage</p>
<p>Britain 301 1,307,083</p>
<p>France 176 520,732</p>
<p>Italy 218 428,921</p>
<p>Germany 65 135,257</p>
<p>The strength of naval power can be assessed from various different points of view; the amount of tonnage is not the only criterion, but for a general comparison, it is acceptable to use tonnage as a measure. According to the tonnage listed in the table on the right, if Britain and France are added together to resist Germany and Italy, then Britain and France are three times stronger, which is an absolute advantage. If the French fleet allies with Germany and Italy to resist Britain, then Britain is only slightly stronger in comparison, but British warships still have to be reserved for the Indian Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, and the Far East, and cannot all fight in the Atlantic and Mediterranean; so Britain not only cannot grasp the advantage, but it can even be said to be comparatively inferior. Therefore, solely in terms of European naval power, the French Navy occupies a pivotal position. Since Germany's victory in land warfare and France's submission, wouldn't Germany and Italy want to take the French Navy for their own use in order to fight against Britain? However, Article 8 of the German-French armistice agreement guarantees that the French Navy will not be used for combat; Article 12 of the Italian-French armistice agreement, in addition to declaring that the French Navy will not be used for combat, further declares that there will be no demands on the French Navy when concluding a peace treaty in the future. What is the reason for this? Is it because the strength of the French Navy is not worth mentioning? Is it because of benevolence and morality? Neither is the case. Germany and Italy clearly know that the German and Italian navies are no match for Britain, but Germany is confident in its air force and army, and Italy is also quite proud of its air force, believing that this is enough to control Britain. If they could drive and command the French Navy, it would naturally be great; but they also know that the French Navy may not be willing to fight, or if they are willing to fight, they will definitely side with Britain, and will not be happy to obey Germany and Italy and resist Britain. Therefore, what is guaranteed and declared in the armistice agreement is by no means a military view, but a political strategy; the guarantee and the declaration are only to avoid the lesson of chasing fish in the deep sea and chasing birds in the forest, promising to preserve it, and not driving it for the use of Britain.</p>
<p>So, what will become of the French Navy? The answer is not far off, and we cannot know it now. But its impact is directly related to the German army's offensive against Britain, and the British-Italian war in the Mediterranean; it is indirectly related to the status of the French Bordeaux government in relation to the victorious country, and the status of the National Committee in relation to the various French colonies. Extending even further, it is also implicitly an important factor in the evolution of the international situation in the future. Yesterday, a telegram reported that the French Governor-General of Vietnam described the strength of the combined British-French fleet in the Far East; yesterday, it was also reported that the Bordeaux government had dismissed the Governor of Vietnam; even these two pieces of news, although there is no way to know the details, can reveal that the implications are far-reaching and the situation is subtle. Then, is it not extremely noteworthy what will become of the French Navy?</p>

<p>Gaoan. The Chinese troops besieging Anyi are now tightening the encirclement and advancing towards the suburbs. The highlands north of the city, E'hushan and Fenghuangshan, are now in Chinese hands. It will not be difficult to annihilate the remaining Japanese soldiers in the city. To the west of Nanchang, in the Wanshougong area, the fighting is still ongoing in the Baixuanshan area northeast of Wanshougong. (June 26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Fengcheng. The Chinese army attacking Nanchang launched an attack on the Japanese troops in Chucha, north of Yaohu, east of Nanchang, on the night of June 27th. The Japanese resisted stubbornly by relying on the dangerous terrain. After several fierce assaults by the Chinese army, Chucha was completely recaptured at 6 AM on the 26th. Many Japanese corpses were left behind. Currently, the Chinese army is tracking down and annihilating the remaining Japanese soldiers. (June 26th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Chinese Army in Eastern Henan Recaptures Two 集 (Market Towns)</h3>
<p>Luoyang. The Chinese army in eastern Henan has launched attacks in recent days, with great success. More than 6,000 Japanese soldiers entrenched in the Zhaoji and Chenji areas northeast of Mengcheng were fiercely attacked by the Chinese army on the 18th. After a day of fighting, the Japanese army was unable to withstand the attacks and retreated to the northwest. The Chinese army recaptured the Zhaoji and Chenji areas and is currently advancing in pursuit of victory. Also, at noon on the 19th, more than 100 Japanese cavalrymen who invaded the area near Liulin in Huaiyang were also defeated by the Chinese army. (June 27th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Near Xianning Heavily Defeated by Chinese Army</h3>
<p>Miluo. The Chinese army in southern Hubei has been separately surrounding and annihilating Japanese troops in Chongyang, Xiangushan, and Mujiafan for several consecutive days. Japanese casualties are extremely heavy. The transportation from Tiezhu Port to Dashaping has been completely destroyed by the Chinese army, and the Japanese army is extremely panicked. In addition, the Chinese army, which has penetrated deep behind the Japanese lines, launched a fierce attack on Maqiao (south of Xianning) and Yangjiafan on the 23rd, killing many Japanese soldiers. Another unit attacked Guanbuqiao (east of Xianning), completely surrounding the Japanese troops and is currently annihilating them. (June 27th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Over a Hundred Japanese Planes Bomb Chongqing School District; Part of National Central University Destroyed; One Japanese Plane Shot Down</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Around noon today, over a hundred Japanese bombers, divided into three groups, bombed the western suburbs of Chongqing. Fires broke out in several places outside the city, but no bombs fell within the city. According to Chinese sources, three Japanese planes were shot down by anti-aircraft fire during yesterday's air raid. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: When the third wave of Japanese planes attacked Chongqing today, they dropped dozens of explosive bombs in the Shapingba school district. Several dozen buildings, including laboratories, factories, and faculty residences of National Central University, were destroyed. Fortunately, it is during the summer vacation, and the school had already taken emergency measures, so there were no casualties among teachers and students. However, the situation for the faculty members whose homes were bombed is said to be very difficult. (27th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Three squadrons of Japanese planes again raided the western suburbs of Chongqing this morning. Many bombs fell on both banks of the Jialing River, immediately causing several large fires. However, the city area was not bombed. Several large bombs fell near the "Jialing Apartments," where foreign reporters reside. In addition, several private residences and a large number of thatched sheds were destroyed along the Chengdu-Chongqing highway. According to recent days of Japanese bombing, although the number of casualties is not very high, thousands of people have been left homeless, mostly the poor. From a military point of view, this kind of Japanese air raid has virtually no effect. This kind of terror bombing will never demoralize the people. On the contrary, the people of Chongqing, seeing that the Japanese planes come every day, have become accustomed to it. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Three large squadrons of Japanese planes, each with fifty-four planes, totaling one hundred and sixty-two planes, intruded into the skies over Chongqing again at 11:30 AM today, indiscriminately bombing and dropping hundreds of bombs. Five hundred civilians were killed or wounded. From the confluence of the Jialing and Yangtze Rivers to Jialing Village, almost no place was spared. Hundreds of shops and houses were destroyed, with rubble and ruins everywhere. Bombs fell near the French and Soviet embassies, shaking the buildings and sending tiles flying. A bomb also fell in front of the Jialing Apartments (where foreign journalists reside after the Chongqing Hotel was bombed), almost destroying it. In addition, Dongchuan Middle School, the Canadian Church Hospital, and the YMCA dormitory were all bombed. Considering the wide scope of this Japanese bombing, the fact that only about 500 people were killed or wounded is not considered many. It is generally believed that this is due to the effective air defense of the Chinese government and the carefulness of the residents. Four Japanese planes were shot down by Chinese fighter planes in this battle. As soon as the Japanese planes had not yet escaped, Chinese rescue teams rushed to provide aid. Workers swept the streets and removed corpses. By the time the authorities lifted the air raid alert, the people had emerged from the air raid shelters, and everything had returned to normal in an instant. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Chongqing was again bombed by Japanese planes yesterday. Several bombs fell near the German Embassy and in the residential area near the Soviet Embassy. The so-called safe zone on the south bank of the Yangtze River was also hit by several bombs. (Haitong, 27th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: One hundred and twenty Japanese planes again fiercely bombed Chongqing in four waves yesterday, including the city area. The German and Soviet embassies and the Canadian Church Hospital were all destroyed. The printing press and editorial department of the Ta Kung Pao were also destroyed, but the newspaper continued to publish as usual. Other places hit include the YMCA cinema, a Buddhist temple, and the New Sichuan Opera House. Two bombs fell near the American Embassy, causing no damage. According to Chinese sources, three Japanese planes were shot down. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Japanese planes have suffered heavy losses in their continuous attacks on Chongqing. On the 27th, the Japanese again gathered over ninety planes and attacked in waves, hiding in the high clouds to avoid attacks by the Chinese air force and anti-aircraft units. The Chinese air force had already seen through their plan and formed a net to intercept them in the high sky. When the Japanese planes flew into the Chinese encirclement, several Japanese planes were damaged and retreated south in disarray. The Chinese air force bravely pursued them to the skies over Nanchuan. One Japanese plane was shot down by the Chinese and burned in northern Nanchuan. The Chinese air force safely returned to base at 1:00 PM. (27th)</p>

<h3>Severely Wounded Japanese Troops Invading West of Suxian</h3>
<p>A certain place in northern Anhui: The Japanese Ito-Toki Detachment has been invading westward from Suxian for days. They reached the vicinity of Nanping the day before yesterday and were met with a head-on blow by the Chinese army. After fierce fighting until the evening, 300 Japanese soldiers were killed. The Japanese offensive was greatly frustrated. The Japanese then reinforced and launched a fierce attack, which the Chinese army bravely resisted. After fierce fighting until yesterday morning, the Japanese suffered even more casualties, and the Chinese continued to inflict heavy losses. (27th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Army in Shandong Captures Zhaoxian</h3>
<p>Tianjin: According to news from Qingdao, Zhaoyuan, located in the northwestern corner of the Shandong Peninsula, has been captured by the Chinese army. The Japanese army suffered heavy losses during their retreat. It is now reported that the Chinese army is advancing along the highway towards Longkou and Laiyang. (Express News Agency, 27th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Anbei Surrounded</h3>
<p>Western Sui: A unit of Japanese troops in Anbei attempted to invade Gaotailiang on the 21st.

The Chinese also dispatched troops to encircle the Japanese from the rear, and they are now intensifying their efforts to annihilate them. Over a thousand Japanese troops in front of the Wula Mountains attempted to invade the vicinity of Xishanzui on the 20th, but they were repulsed by the Chinese army, suffering heavy casualties.

<h3>Britain Urges French Fleet to Sail to Free Military Ports; Germany Claims British Landing Force Repulsed; French Government Prepares to Move from Bordeaux</h3>
<p>London: The British government last night urged all commanders of the French fleet to sail their fleets to British or French free military ports to help defend French territory. This appeal was broadcast in French via wireless and by the BBC. The British appeal, titled "Important Message to French Fleet Officers," stated that the armistice agreement in Compiegne was intended to preserve French territory, but this has not been achieved, and Indochina is now threatened. The land rich in natural resources and not controlled by the Germans is the core of French resistance and should be the focus of French sailors, which is their duty. Prepare quickly to defend this great French empire and immediately sail the fleet to free military ports, whether they belong to France or the Allies. (Associated Press, 27th)</p>
<p>London: According to sources, the French government plans to move from the port of Bordeaux to the city of Clermont-Ferrand. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The responsible authorities here announced last night that several British warships attempted to make small-scale landings at two locations on the French coast yesterday but were repulsed by German forces. Only two German soldiers were injured. British propaganda about "Allied naval, land, and air forces landing in enemy coastal areas" is completely exaggerated. (Haitong, 27th)</p>
<p>Gibraltar: According to reliable sources, French warships and government offices in Casablanca, Morocco, are now flying flags at half-mast. All French residents in the area have declared to the Moroccan High Commissioner their determination to continue the war alongside Britain. Former French Prime Minister Daladier is reportedly under arrest in Casablanca. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3>French Government Appoints Representatives to Armistice Commission</h3>
<p>Geneva: The French cabinet today appointed representatives to the French armistice commissions stationed in Germany and Italy. The delegation to Germany is headed by General Huntziger, followed by Admiral Michelier, responsible for naval matters, and General Houssais, responsible for air force matters. The others are Bianquis, governor of several departments; Allix, an auditor from the Ministry of Finance; Parodi, the general manager of labor and trade; Bersillon, an associate of the French railway company; and Recape, an industrialist. The delegation to Italy is headed by Admiral Duplat, followed by General Parisot, responsible for army matters, and General Vaudier, responsible for air force matters. The others are Norch, governor of the Basses-Alpes department; Contenil, an auditor from the Ministry of Finance; Comte, a senator; Canton, the director of the Port of Marseille; and Garnier, a counselor at the embassy. (Haitong, 24th)</p>
<h3>British Forces Launch Raids Across the Sea, Demonstrating Offensive Spirit</h3>
<p>London: An Information Ministry communiqué stated that British naval, land, and air forces, in cooperation with the Royal Air Force, conducted reconnaissance along enemy coastlines on Sunday, obtaining much useful information. British forces landed in several locations and made contact with German forces, inflicting many casualties. Some enemy corpses fell into our hands, and our forces also suffered casualties. According to a Reuters military correspondent, this British landing shows the difficulty for the German forces to try to maintain the entire northern coastline (from the North Cape in the far north of Europe, along the coasts of Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France, straight down to the Spanish border), because the German navy's strength has been greatly reduced in battles with the Allied navy. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>London: The Times newspaper published an article commenting on yesterday's British raid on German forces at the Channel ports, saying that this action shows the British army's offensive spirit, which is what the public wants to see. This action also shows that we neither need nor intend to simply sit and wait for an attack, but when the opportunity arises, or can be found, we are prepared and able to attack the areas occupied by the enemy. In short, sea power is not a worthless tool, as the enemy claims. The authorities' communiqué did not mention many battle achievements, and they do not want to exaggerate elsewhere either, but this British military action is at least not something that a country suffering from spiritual or material inferiority could fully plan and carry out. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3>British Blockade Measures Extended to French Ports</h3>
<p>London: Responsible figures here recently announced that, according to the French-German armistice agreement, the western coast of France will be occupied by German forces. Therefore, any ship sailing to or from the ports of western France will be intercepted and detained by the British Navy. Ships of all countries sailing to ports in the unoccupied areas of southern France will be subject to inspection by the British naval authorities in British Gibraltar. In addition, ships of all countries sailing to ports in Spain and Portugal will also be subject to British inspection. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<h3>German and Italian War Reports</h3>
<p>Hitler's Headquarters: This afternoon's German war report stated that German forces had advanced according to the terms of the armistice agreement to the Dordogne area, east of Bordeaux. The enemy navy had reconnoitered the northern coast of France the night before and attempted to attack, but was repulsed due to its limited strength. A German submarine reported sinking 33,000 tons of enemy merchant ships. Last night, German fighters again bombed British seaports and airfields. One German aircraft did not return to base. British aircraft continued to bomb western Germany. Many German civilians were killed and injured last night. There was no damage to military targets. Two British aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft fire, and one was shot down by a fighter. Major Schüller, commander of the German infantry battalion, was exceptionally brave, risking his life to cross the Rhine River on June 15th, gaining widespread fame. He has recently performed meritorious service again. (Haitong, 27th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The war on the Western Front has ended, but the war against Britain continues. Military experts gave speeches supplementing the German war report, stating that it is not yet known when the German army will occupy the locations stipulated by the German-French armistice agreement. The date of occupation will likely be decided after the Armistice Commission, chaired by General Stülpnagel, is established in Wiesbaden. Britain is currently the only enemy of the German army, and the German army will use all its strength to continue fighting against Britain. German aircraft continue to bomb airfields and aircraft industry centers in central Britain. Three British bombers made a second attack on Stavanger Airport in Norway. Two were shot down by German fighters, and the third fled in panic. A German submarine sank a British armed ship of 12,000 tons in the southwest of Ireland, and also sank two other armed merchant ships. (Haitong, 27th)</p>
<p>Rome: The Italian military headquarters issued a war report today stating that multiple bombers have again attacked Malta, bombing its naval and air force bases. Our aircraft all safely returned to base. In North Africa, our aircraft bombed enemy camps and vehicles. Enemy aircraft attacked Massawa and Assab unsuccessfully. (Haitong, 27th)</p>
<p>Milan: The Italian submarine that sank the British cruiser "Kelly" (4,200 tons) has returned to base in La Spezia. Commander Bittoni has been promoted to the rank of major in the navy for his meritorious service in battle. Major Bittoni said that the submarine attacked the "Kelly" at night, from a distance of about 120 meters. At that time, the British ship, along with another British cruiser and two torpedo boats, returned fire, but to no avail. (Haitong, 27th)</p>

<h3>German Newspaper Comments on Armistice Agreement</h3>
<p>Berlin: The German "Political Foreign Communications" today published an article commenting on the German-French and Italian-French armistice agreements, pointing out that although the French government authorities, when engaging in war with Germany, did not harbor defensive intentions, but annihilation intentions, the German authorities did not want to inflict revenge, placing the French people in difficulty, because France once wanted to destroy its survival, its independence, and its unification. Germany had suffered deeply from humiliation after the last world war, and this time it was determined not to reciprocate the French by treating them as France had treated them. (Haitong, 27th)</p>
<h3>Britain Unwilling to Consider Peace Issues</h3>
<p>London: Rumors circulating in London that the British ambassador to Spain, Sir Samuel Hoare, had discussed peace issues or armistice terms in Madrid are absolutely untrue. In fact, Hoare has firmly declared Britain's determination to continue the struggle. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>London: Parliamentary sources here reported yesterday that Führer Hitler is preparing to deliver a speech this Friday, predicting that he will propose a peace plan, declaring Germany's satisfaction with what it has obtained and Germany's willingness to negotiate an agreement with Britain. Well-informed circles predict that if Germany proposes terms of peace, they will surely be rejected. (Associated Press, 27th)</p>

<h3>China Prepares to Use Force to Protect Sino-Vietnamese Transportation; Vietnamese Authorities Undertake Preparations; Japanese Troops Have Been Blocked at Suilu</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Reliable sources here claimed yesterday that China is now fully prepared to use force or other means to prevent the closing of the Sino-Vietnamese border. They criticized the Franco-Japanese agreement to halt the transportation of war materials into China via Annam, stating that China will do everything possible to obstruct the implementation of the agreement. Vietnam is Chinese territory, seized by France after the Sino-French War in 1885. If France is unable to defend its territory, it should be returned to China rather than placed under Japanese occupation or control. (United Press dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Reports here state that Vietnamese authorities are currently taking all precautions to prevent possible aggression. The current governor is acting independently from the Bordeaux government, but he reportedly still recognizes the validity of the Franco-Japanese agreement to jointly patrol the border area. French women and children are being moved inland from the coast and the Chinese border. However, current Japanese troop movements seem limited to the Guangxi area, with troops stationed along the border between that province and Vietnam. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>London: The French National Committee recently stated that its leader, de Gaulle, has received a report from the Governor-General of Vietnam, Catroux, stating that French forces are prepared to resist any attempts to invade Vietnam. The Committee also told the press that it believes General Nogues, Commander-in-Chief of French forces in North Africa, has taken all necessary steps to deal with any aggression. (United Press dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Asahi Shimbun reports that the Foreign Ministry will issue an oral statement tomorrow, declaring that East Asia has the right to independently prevent the spread of the European war to Asia and to resolve the China Incident. The newspaper anticipates that the gist of the statement will be as follows: (1) Interference by third countries in East Asia will not be tolerated. (2) Japan will severely and rigorously punish any attempt to disadvantage Japan's current situation in East Asia. (3) Japan's policy of non-involvement in the European war will be extended to the entirety of East Asia. (4) As long as Germany and Italy do not disrupt the security of East Asia, Japan's friendly relations with them will become closer. At the same time, under the current circumstances, some friction between Japan and the United States and Britain is perhaps unavoidable, as Japan's objective is to establish East Asia's autonomy. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Navy spokesman Rear Admiral Kanazawa declared today at a press conference that a Japanese naval unit has been dispatched to Haiphong to inspect whether the transport of goods via Vietnam to China is indeed being prohibited by the French government. Land transportation conditions in Vietnam will be monitored by Japanese inspectors, while sea routes will be inspected by the navy. The dispatch of these warships to Haiphong is merely a temporary measure. A very large number of supplies have been transported to the Chongqing government via French Indochina, British Burma, and Hong Kong. Currently, the transport of supplies to China via Vietnam is nearing its end, while the flow of goods into China via Burma and Hong Kong is becoming more active. Therefore, Japan has lodged a strong protest with the British government and is awaiting a response from London. At the same time, the Japanese government and local Japanese forces are closely monitoring the development of the situation. When a reporter asked whether Japanese air force would reconnoiter the Burma route, the spokesman replied that, for obvious reasons, it was not appropriate to comment on future Japanese military actions, but that it was quite possible for Japanese air force to fly over the Burma route. The spokesman also said that, according to newspaper reports, Japanese pilots who reconnoitered the area bordering Vietnam and Guangxi province yesterday had sighted dozens of motor vehicles loaded with supplies traveling from Vietnam to China. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to a Chinese spokesperson today, a portion of the Japanese forces in southern Guangxi advanced southwest from Nanning on the 21st, attempting to push towards the Sino-Vietnamese border. After fierce resistance by Chinese troops, the Japanese forces have been blocked near Suilu. (Express News dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: According to reports from Haiphong, the French Indochina government had already closed off traffic between Guangxi and Vietnam when Japanese forces approached Longzhou. Now, with reports of Japanese troops being sighted near Dongxing on the Chinese side, they have also urgently closed off traffic on the border between Guangdong and Vietnam. Martial law has also been declared in Lang Son, Dong Dang, and Na Cham. According to disclosures from Japanese sources here, Japanese forces are urgently seeking to expand their encirclement of Vietnam in order to completely cut off Sino-Vietnamese transportation. (Express News dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to a semi-official Japanese source in South China, Japanese troops do not intend to invade French Indochina, but only to intercept the movement of military supplies being transported via Vietnam to General Chiang Kai-shek's forces. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Change of Governor in Vietnam</p>
<p>Madrid: According to a Bordeaux report, French President Lebrun has signed an order appointing Lieutenant General Decoux as Governor-General of Vietnam. The former Governor-General, General Catroux, has been recalled to France. It is reported that Gaston, the Director of Political Affairs in the French Colonial Ministry, has been transferred to New Caledonia and the Pacific Islands as a special commissioner. Keira has been appointed Governor of Madagascar, and Boisson has been appointed High Commissioner of Equatorial Africa, French West Africa, Cameroon, and the mandated territory of Togo. (Haitong Press dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Japan Demands Suspension of Cargo Transport via Burma; British Government Considering; Traffic Between Hong Kong and Mainland Completely Blocked</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: The Japanese side continues to expand its military operations along the border. Japanese vanguard troops advanced from Nantou in the west and occupied Shatoujiao and Shawei Chong (both transliterations) on the eastern end of the peninsula this morning. The situation remains calm. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: The Hong Kong government has announced that Japanese forces have completely blocked routes between Hong Kong and mainland China today. Japanese military authorities have allowed traffic to enter and exit the border area only on July 1st and July 2nd; thereafter, traffic will be completely prohibited. (United Press dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent reports that London has received a request from the Japanese government, forwarded by the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie. The Japanese side is asking Britain to take effective measures to stop all war materials and supplies from being transported into China via Burma and Hong Kong. The British government is currently considering this request carefully. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: The Hong Kong government announced that Japanese troops have completely blockaded traffic between Hong Kong and mainland China today. The Japanese military authorities will only permit entry to and exit from Hong Kong along the border at specified times on July 1 and 2, after which all traffic will be completely prohibited. (Express News dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: In light of the threatening attitude taken by the Japanese press and recent Japanese spokesmen, the Hong Kong authorities are implementing precautionary measures. Bridges across the Shenzhen River have been destroyed. It is reported that British women and children living near the border have been ordered to return to the city. Unofficial sources believe that the Japanese side will deal with Hong Kong in the same way as they blockaded the British and French concessions in Tianjin.

<h3>Japanese Military Police to be Stationed in Tianjin British Concession</h3>
<p>Tianjin: Reuters has learned from responsible sources that, according to the basic terms of the Tianjin agreement signed by Britain and Japan in Tokyo, ten Japanese military police officers will be stationed in the British Concession, residing in the courtyard of the Japanese Consul-General's residence on Yingzhong Street. At the same time, Major Ota, commander of the Tianjin Japanese military police, has been appointed as a liaison officer, with an office in the police headquarters of the British Municipal Council. His duties will be to maintain contact between the British and Japanese police authorities. As for the purpose of stationing Japanese military police in the British Concession, it is only so that the Japanese military police can immediately join when the British Municipal Council wants to search for suspected terrorists in the presence of Japanese officers. At present, Japanese police will still not be able to independently conduct searches within the British Concession without the cooperation of the British authorities, and will still only have observer status. It is reported that the same method is now being implemented in the French Concession. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3>Arita Enters the Palace to Pay Homage to the Japanese Emperor and Submits a New Policy Outline</h3>
<p>Tokyo Foreign Minister Arita entered the palace today to pay homage to the Japanese Emperor and submitted an informal report on the new outline principles of Japan's diplomatic policy. The development of the European war situation is likely to threaten the Far East, so new principles must be established as a stabilizing force in East Asia. The new basic diplomatic policy, after being approved by the cabinet on Saturday morning, will be announced on that day by the Foreign Minister in the form of a statement. Qualified observers believe that the statement will contain three points as follows: (1) Japan absolutely cannot tolerate any changes in the status quo of East Asia, as this would interfere with Japan's handling of the China Incident, which it is currently pursuing with all its might. (2) Japan is deeply concerned about any attempts to change the status quo of East Asia, whether by Britain, the United States, Germany, or Italy. (3) Japan adheres to a policy of non-intervention in the European war, but will independently deal with the impact of the European war on East Asia. In short, the statement aims to announce Japan's policy of establishing East Asian autonomy. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Supreme Council Issues Order Extending Working Hours Effective Yesterday</h3>

As for company employees, the daily working hours will be six to eight hours, and those aged sixteen will also work six to eight hours. (2) To work one additional day per week.

<h3>President Roosevelt's Third Term Re-election Seems Inevitable Fate</h3>
<p>Washington: The European war situation is becoming increasingly complicated, so President Roosevelt's third re-election seems to be an inevitable fate. Republicans secretly gathered in Washington and believed that Roosevelt has an influence on today's American political stage that cannot be underestimated, so the November 4 election will be a fierce competition. Whether Roosevelt himself wants to be re-elected is still unknown, but the movement to support Roosevelt's re-election has reached a very high stage, so experienced observers believe that if Roosevelt wants to be re-elected, Roosevelt will definitely be elected in the primaries held in Chicago in July. A year ago, wise Democratic politicians all said that this could never happen. A year ago, Republicans were all confident that their party, which had been out of power for eight years, would finally achieve final victory in 1940. However, also a year ago, President Roosevelt warned the country that the European war would soon occur. At that time, many people did not believe him. Then, on September 1, 1939, Hitler ordered his troops to enter Poland, and many people initially thought that the European war would never affect the United States and the entire Western Hemisphere. But then, on May 10 of this year, Hitler launched his blitzkrieg tactics and took the Netherlands and Belgium in one fell swoop, causing the Allies to abandon their armor and flee. Then, both Roosevelt's friends and enemies recognized that Roosevelt's judgment of the international situation was accurate, even recalling Roosevelt's speech in Chicago in October 1937, when he suggested imposing "quarantine" procedures on certain aggressive countries and suggested "various strategies to prevent war." However, it only shocked the country and earned a round of ridicule and criticism. Today, precisely because Roosevelt has agile thinking and a broad vision, Democrats have the hope of a third victory. The opinions of some observers are that the competition Roosevelt will face in this election will largely depend on the development of the European situation in the coming months. According to Roosevelt's medical advisors, although Roosevelt is 59 years old this year, he is mentally and physically strong. Roosevelt's smile and his speeches on radio and the podium still have a moving magic. However, those who have met with Roosevelt every day in the past eight years have said that in the last eleven months, several new wrinkles have been added to Roosevelt's face, and his hair has also turned gray. In the previous seven years, Roosevelt's New Deal, although hard work, had never shown this phenomenon. (International Press dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3>Pittman Discusses British Defense, Says No Defense Preparedness; Londoners Surprised</h3>
<p>Washington - U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman, while giving his opinion to reporters here yesterday, stated that the most effective method to prevent Hitler's advance is to continue fighting from the New World, rather than striving to defend the British Isles. It is now no secret that Britain has no defense preparedness whatsoever. No matter what assistance the United States provides, it will only delay the outcome of the war. It is now evident that Congress will not permit involvement in the European war, he said. (Reuter, 27th)</p>
<p>London - British figures were quite surprised upon hearing the remarks made by U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman regarding British defense plans. Some quarters here today issued criticisms, expressing strong disagreement with the claims that Britain has no defense preparedness and that the assistance the United States can provide cannot change the outcome of the war. However, they stated that American factories and workers are currently making great efforts to assist Britain in conducting its certain war. The British are extremely grateful. If Britain, with its 45 million people, were to quietly lay down its arms and not fight, it would fail to live up to the great intentions of American assistance. However, Britain has absolutely no intention of surrendering without a fight, but rather holds the determination to continue fighting and ultimately achieve victory. (Reuter, 27th)</p>

The first event will be a women's exhibition match between Shanghai Star and Jingwu, followed by two Jia-1 group matches, Qifan vs. Youlian and Shanghai Star vs. Liangxi. Qifan is the temporary name for the bomber. The day after tomorrow, in addition to the two Jia-2 group matches, the event will be capped off by a meeting between the two champions of the Chinese and Western Youth Leagues, Paramount and Shanghai Youth. The two teams performed a charity performance at the Chinese Youth League several months ago, and this reunion is a rare opportunity. Because the venue has a small capacity, tickets are temporarily limited to 300, with each ticket costing one yuan, and sales will stop when the limit is reached. The income, excluding expenses, will be donated to the Orphanage. In order to make the ceremony grand, Mr. Yuan Ludeng has been specially invited to preside over the opening ceremony. At the same time, Mr. Zhu Daxun, the prize donor, in view of the hard work of the two women's teams Shanghai Star and Jingwu for the sake of the orphans, specially presented two additional trophies. One is the Kangxiu Cup, to commemorate his late parents-in-law, Lu Baokang and his wife, which will be awarded to the winning team. The other is the Dahong Cup, which commemorates his deceased brother, Zhu Dahong, and will be awarded by Mrs. Zhu. The tasks of ticket collection and security will be handled by the Boy Scouts of the Orphanage. The Orphanage will also send a military band to play music and female nurses to provide services.</p>

<h3>Japan's Ambitions Fully Exposed, Southern Advance Almost Imminent; Rumors that Japan will Land in Hong Kong or Vietnam; The United States Will Definitely Express Itself to Protect Its Interests</h3>
<p>According to foreign sources, the Indian Independence League in Tokyo has made a request to the Japanese and German authorities to preserve the freedom of French Vietnam and Dutch East Indies. The League passed a resolution stating that Japan should assist Annam and Dutch East Indies in maintaining their independence in Asia and establishing two countries in Asia. This action will be unanimously supported by Asians. To Germany, in addition to congratulating it on its victory over France, it also requested Germany to "force" France and the Netherlands to maintain the complete freedom of Annam and Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>Hong Kong and Vietnam - The Situation is Urgent</p>
<p>The Dalu Daily reported that political circles here received private news last night (June 26) stating that after the Japanese military and consulate authorities made a request to the British authorities in Hong Kong on Monday to close the Hong Kong supply route to Chongqing, the Hong Kong authorities have begun to move important documents to Singapore. It is heard that the Japanese side has also requested that all Chinese officials and organizations related to the Chongqing government be expelled from Hong Kong. According to a Hong Kong telegram from International News Service, four Japanese divisions have sailed from Japan to China. According to information learned from Shanghai last night, the Japanese troops will land near Hong Kong or Vietnam. If their destination is Hong Kong, they will arrive and land on the 28th or 29th.</p>
<p>British Policy - Extremely Important</p>
<p>Yesterday's Reuter telegram stated that London has received a request from the Japanese government through the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie. The Japanese side requested that the United Kingdom take effective measures to stop all war material supplies from being transported to China through Burma and Hong Kong. The British government is currently reviewing and considering this request. Chinese circles in this city are extremely concerned about this. However, it is hoped that the British authorities will thoroughly understand that concessions and compromises with the aggressor will not only fail to achieve a situation of temporary peace, but will also fuel the aggressor's ambitions. Past facts are not uncommon, and the British government should also be aware of this.</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies Navy - Strong Strength</p>
<p>The North China Daily News stated that the Dutch Navy is still maintaining its normal state in the Dutch East Indies. Although its number is small, its combat power is extremely strong. It includes four new-type cruisers, including the Ruytir (6,450 tons) and the TromP (3,350 tons), which are currently in the national territorial waters. Defensive battleships and armed gunboats are also moored along the coast of the Netherlands, as well as 13 torpedo boats and submarines ranging from 150 tons to 264 tons, with a displacement of approximately 500 tons or more. The East Indies Fleet has two cruisers, equipped with 10-inch guns, eight destroyers, and seven submarines. The above ships can carry aircraft or install torpedoes when necessary.</p>
<p>The United States Will Definitely Take Action</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury published an article last night by renowned British commentator Woodhead discussing the consequences of Japan's southward advance. According to Woodhead's opinion, it is not possible to conclude at this time whether the Tokyo authorities will take more active actions than blockading Vietnam. In short, some people in Japan strongly advocate:</p>
<p>Utilizing the European war situation to attack Britain, the United States, and France. The Miani cabinet's failure to end the war in China has caused dissatisfaction among all parties. The cabinet may be reorganized in the future and presided over by extremists. These people attempt to "expel the countries that support the old order in East Asia." Their ambition is obvious. They believe that Vietnam is already</p>
<p>"A ripe fruit that will fall with a touch." If they can seize power and control the overall situation, Japan will definitely break with Britain and the United States. The United States' reaction to Japan's invasion of Vietnam cannot be predicted at this time. From the perspective of American interests, the United States is more concerned about maintaining the status quo of the Dutch East Indies than Vietnam. The Dutch East Indies</p>
<p>The production of rubber accounts for two-fifths of the world's total production. At the same time, the United States also has a substantial interest in maintaining the traffic on the Yunnan Railway, which is the only export outlet for the Chinese government to export goods to repay US loans. Most of China's tung oil, tungsten iron, and aluminum rely on this road for export.</p>
<p>The Burma-Yunnan Highway can currently only transport hundreds of tons of goods. Woodhead finally believed that France, in its current situation, cannot refuse the Japanese request, but if its acceptance of the Japanese request results in hindering Sino-US trade, the US authorities will undoubtedly lodge a strong protest with both Japan and France.</p>
<h3>"July 7th" Incident - Third Anniversary</h3>
<p>The third anniversary of the July 7th Incident is fast approaching. All circles in this city regard this day as the beginning of the war of resistance, national reconstruction, and national revival. At that time, they will unanimously use a silent attitude to make a solemn commemoration and mourn the fallen soldiers. According to the central government's regulations, this day is the Memorial Day for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. It will be commemorated enthusiastically throughout the country. However, due to the special environment in this city, the commemorative ceremony will be suspended as it was last year. The Public Concession Bureau of Works and the French Concession Municipal Council, in order to prevent unscrupulous elements from taking the opportunity to cause trouble at this time of unrest, will take precautions in advance, prohibit various gatherings, and implement special precautions for one day to prevent and maintain public security.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Puppet Government Covets the Court; The Authorities Ignore It; The Bureau of Works Denies Negotiations</h3>
<p>The Japanese puppet government has long coveted the courts of the Shanghai Special Area. It is not known that the court was agreed upon and constituted by the Chinese government and the countries that have treaties in China. Before the treaty is abolished, both parties should abide by it and cannot be transferred to the puppet government by one party's will. According to the Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury yesterday, Philip, the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, denied again on the morning of the 27th the statement made by the spokesman of the Japanese Embassy regarding the jurisdiction of the local court in the Special Area of Muddy Banks. It is said that this issue has not been negotiated, and the court is constituted by the Chinese government and the countries that have treaties in China. The Bureau of Works has no relationship with the court in any way. What the Bureau of Works cares about is that the local court in the Shanghai Special Area can effectively continue to perform its duties and handle civil and criminal cases.</p>
<h3>Rice Ban Lifted in Hong Kong; Shanghai Municipal Council Approves Encouraging Wheat Imports</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made Noodle Industry Association previously submitted a request to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to forward to the authorities, seeking to facilitate the source of wheat. Yesterday, they received a reply from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, stating that they had received a letter from Mr. Cabot, Deputy General Manager of the Shanghai Municipal Council, which read: "Regarding your letter of June 17th concerning facilitating the source of wheat, this council will make every effort to encourage the import of a considerable amount of wheat to reassure the citizens. Please set your minds at ease."</p>
<p>Bean and Rice Industry</p>
<p>The Industry Association once sent representatives to appeal to the Shanghai Municipal Council, requesting them to ask the British Consul-General to negotiate the permission to transport Hong Kong rice to Shanghai for relief, in order to stabilize the market situation. Yesterday, reliable news was obtained from the rice industry that local firms such as Yu Shenglong had received telegrams from Hong Kong rice merchants reporting that the Hong Kong authorities had already lifted the ban, allowing the export of rice. It is generally believed that the reason for this is that shipping between Haiphong and Hong Kong is now open, and tribute rice can be directly transported to Hong Kong. Since the opening of shipping between Haiphong and Hong Kong, various local firms immediately entrusted the French firm D’Affre to telegraph Saigon to order a large amount of tribute rice, around 10,000 tons. It is now known that 5,000 tons of tribute rice</p>
<p>Have Already Set Sail</p>
<p>And should arrive around July 10th, and are currently en route to Shanghai. It is also known that various local firms, in order to increase reserves and eliminate public panic about food, in addition to commissioning the purchase of Saigon rice for transport to Shanghai, are continuing to entrust the British firm Jardine Matheson to telegraph Siam to order a large amount of Siamese rice, reaching over 13,000 tons. It is now known that the Jardine Matheson vessel Srela Smales, carrying 5,600 tons, will arrive on July 18th, and the vessel Believic, carrying 4,600 tons, will arrive on July 26th. As for the 3,200 tons ordered by the Jinan Huaxing Company, it will arrive on July 26th, totaling 13,400 tons. Various rice industry firms are still planning to continuously entrust these foreign firms to order a large amount of foreign rice in order to decide to transport it to Shanghai for regulation.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen to Broadcast on Saturday</h3>
<p>Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador to China, who has returned to Shanghai from Chongqing, will broadcast on the radio station (Xmhd) this Saturday (June 29th). The radio station's frequency is 760 kilocycles and 395 meters. At the same time, the radio station (Xcdm), with a frequency of 1440 kilocycles and 208 meters, will rebroadcast the program. The British Ambassador will make two broadcasts. The first will be at 12:45 pm Shanghai summer time (i.e., 11:45 am China coastal time), and the second will be at 9:00 pm Shanghai summer time (i.e., 8:00 pm China coastal time).</p>
<h3>Tianjin Area to Control Cloth</h3>
<p>Initial Step for Controlling Imports - Other Goods Will Receive the Same Treatment</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, North China first fell, resulting in various industries being controlled. As for the ports of Yantai, Weihaiwei, Longkou, and Qingdao, import and export trade, all goods have been controlled. Since its implementation, it has been nearly a year. Transactions are carried out without cash, practicing barter. Over the years, merchants have suffered greatly, and even foreign merchants have been considerably affected. However, business in Tianjin has not changed. Although the selling prices of grains and flour have been stipulated, import and export goods have not been controlled. Recently, it has been heard that in North China, Japanese cloth is being dumped in large quantities, in order to monopolize the market. From July 1st, imported cotton yarn into Tianjin will be controlled first, in order to achieve its monopolistic intent. Therefore, merchants from the Tianjin community in Shanghai have reduced their procurement of cotton yarn in order to avoid unnecessary losses. Although currently only cotton yarn is controlled, it will be difficult for other goods to avoid the same treatment in the future.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West "Special Police" Unlikely to be Established</h3>
<p>Illegal Activities Continue Unabated; Special Police Will Likely Be Unable to Organize</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council and the "Shanghai Municipal Government" signed an agreement on February 16th this year regarding police affairs in the area of roads built beyond the boundary in western Shanghai. However, there is no hope for the establishment of the special police force in that area. According to a senior official of the Police Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the police department has submitted a proposal for the organization of a special police force, which is awaiting a response from the "Municipal Government." Without a response, the establishment of the special police force</p>
<p>Will Have No Progress</p>
<p>The existence of gambling dens in the western district is the main obstacle to the establishment of the special police force. Not long ago, most of the gambling dens were closed, but now they have changed their names and reopened. If such illegal activities continue unabated, the police force in the western district cannot be established. Therefore, the special police force</p>
<p>Can Only Be Established After All Gambling Dens in the Western District Are Closed</p>
<p>The official continued that once the "Municipal Government" has responded and given its consent, the special police force can begin to be organized. However, the selection of personnel for the special police force has not yet been determined. It is not possible to say when the special police force can be established because it is not known when the "Municipal Government" will respond. According to the Western District Police Agreement, the new police force will consist of 1,200 police officers, who will be selected from the Police Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the "Municipal Police Bureau."</p>
<h3>American Ships Leave Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, the American ships Marblehead, Luzon, and Wake will sail from Shanghai at noon today (the 27th). The cruiser Marblehead will go to Qingdao and is expected to return to Shanghai within a week or ten days. The river gunboats Luzon and Wake will travel to the Yangtze River, and may return to Shanghai within three days. The Marblehead arrived in Shanghai and was stationed on the 12th of this month, while the two gunboats arrived in Shanghai from South China on the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3>Strike at the Shanghai Times</h3>
<p>Over one hundred workers at the Shanghai Times, located at 160 Avenue Edward VII, went on strike because the price of rice and other goods has recently soared, making life difficult. The monthly wage of thirty yuan is not enough to maintain a livelihood. The workers elected several representatives on the 26th to request a wage increase from the management: 60% increase for wages below 30 yuan, 55% increase for wages below 40 yuan, 50% increase for wages below 50 yuan, and 40% increase for wages above 50 yuan. After negotiations between labor and management, the management promised to respond in three days. Yesterday, the management did not respond, and the workers went on strike. The Political Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council learned of this and sent personnel to mediate, but to no avail. All the workers left the premises in the afternoon. It is said that the management has given the workers a deadline to resume work immediately, otherwise they will be dismissed.</p>
<h3>Two Refugee Camps to Close</h3>
<p>Since charitable organizations began the work of disbanding their refugee camps, the number of refugees has decreased from 50,000 to over 27,000. At the end of this month, two more refugee camps will be closed. One is the Aiwen Refugee Camp on North Suzhou Road within the "Municipal Chamber of Commerce" of the Benevolent Relief Association, and the other is the First Refugee Camp on Wenjian Shi Road of the Benevolent Relief Branch. Both refugee camps were opened during the Shanghai War. Currently, they have a total of over 700 people. The refugees in these two refugee camps, except for a portion who will be given money to leave, will all be merged into the Dunxin Road Refugee Camp. The Benevolent Relief Branch is scheduled to issue severance pay today at its office on Avenue Edward VII (17 yuan per adult, 15 yuan per child). The association's education group has stipulated that the refugee schools in each camp will hold end-of-term exams on July 8th and begin summer tutoring on the 15th. Currently, each refugee costs about 10 yuan per month, and donations are urgently needed.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Compatriots Respond to the Winter Clothing Drive, Pledging 500,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 27th - The National Winter Clothing Drive Association recently held a plenary committee meeting and decided to launch a fundraising campaign this year. The detailed measures are being drafted. Upon hearing the news, the compatriots in Shanghai immediately responded with a telegram, pledging 500,000 yuan in advance for winter clothing. This shows that the compatriots in Shanghai, despite being in dire straits, are even more eager to think of the heroic soldiers fighting in the resistance war, which is truly inspiring.</p>
<h3>In Memory of Father Lebbe (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— GBC</p>
<p>Father Lebbe willingly embraced poverty and lived frugally. His clothes and belongings were mostly old and worn, turning from black to yellow, long overdue to be put away, yet he continued to use them, unable to part with them. Although he was harsh on himself, he was extremely kind to others, to the point of "always granting requests," not only to the Chinese but also to people from Belgium, France, Germany, and Austria. It is said that his "compassion" was universal, without distinction of nationality or race, as long as he had it. Students often asked him for maxims, and he always wrote the old saying: "Where charity is, there God is." He truly had charity and was very humble. We never heard him say anything bad about China. In his view, everything in China was good. He often admonished young people not to criticize others' strengths and weaknesses because nine out of ten judgments are wrong. He absolutely obeyed the Holy Church, loved the clergy, and deeply hated atheism and anti-religious doctrines.</p>
<p>Father Lebbe lived to be sixty-three years old and possessed extraordinary talents, so he accomplished extraordinary and amazing things. Whether it was success or failure, let us not discuss it for now, but this spirit of courageously pursuing forward, only cultivating and not asking for harvest, is enough to make the cowardly retreat. Moreover, a founder is not necessarily a successful person. There are countless precedents in history. But Father Lebbe's lifelong hard work, struggle, sacrifice, selflessness, neither envying fame nor seeking profit, in the eyes of ordinary people, is it not "all empty in the end"? Was Father Lebbe not lost? What were his goals and motives? We have also analyzed Father Lebbe's words and deeds, not a chemical or physical analysis, but a rational and ethical analysis, and we feel that his every word and deed, regardless of time or place, regardless of tone or manner, always had a final aim, like a great river flowing into the sea, which is "Love God above all things, love your neighbor as yourself." He said it this way, he did it this way, so in the depths of his marrow and in his blood, there was the shadow of God, and the highest commandment mentioned above. In short, Father Lebbe was a priest, and the mission of a priest is supernatural, not natural.</p>
<p>Before the July 7th Incident, Father Lebbe worked hard in social affairs, not only founding the Yi Shi Bao in Tianjin and Beiping, but also the renowned Ta Kung Pao, which he co-founded with Mr. Ying Lianzhi in Beiping. Therefore, his departure was deeply mourned and sympathized with by the press. After the July 7th Incident, Father Lebbe returned to the battlefields in the north and south, specializing in relief work. It has long been heard that he continued his work despite illness, and that he died from it. Now that dawn is in sight and victory is in sight, Father Lebbe died with his aspirations, sleeping forever by Mount Gele. Looking west, tears streaming down his face, the poem says: "When a person dies, the country is devastated." Alas, how sad! (The End)</p>

<h3>Alleged Police Agreement Established Between Japanese and French Concession</h3>
<p>It is heard that the Japanese side presented to the French Concession authorities on the 21st the idea of establishing a police agreement, the contents of which include (1) extradition of criminals, (2) public searches, etc. Yesterday, news spread that negotiations have already established an agreement between both parties, but confirmation is still needed.</p>
<h3>Armed Robbers Kill and Plunder in Zha Port</h3>
<p>A few days ago, two rice shops in the Nanhui County hired a boat to Huangqiao and bought two boats of white rice, totaling over 360 dan. While being transported back, they passed through Zha Port and were robbed by six or seven armed bandits who, under the guise of inspecting the cargo hold, robbed the rice boats and all nine crew members. The rice was sold in the nearby area, and all nine crew members were brutally murdered to silence them. After several days, the owner heard about the incident and reported the facts, and a chief constable was sent to investigate. Unexpectedly, the constable's actions were not discreet and were discovered by the bandits, who also killed him to eliminate the evidence. In addition, a relative of the boat owner, who ran a sack shop in Zha Port, saw two empty boats moored in the bay about half a mile north of the port. With no one guarding them, he notified his relative to come and claim them. Just as they were about to take the empty boats back, five or six armed men suddenly arrived and detained the four people looking for the boats. They were severely beaten that night and buried alive in the suburbs of Zha Port. Among them was Xu Guisheng, the boat owner's son, who was still young. He desperately crawled out of the soil and sought help from a nearby village, where he was sent to Zhoupu Hospital for treatment. However, he died in the hospital four days later due to his injuries. Currently, most rice merchants in the area dare not go out to buy rice, resulting in no rice being sold around Qin Gongtang, so the price of rice is higher than in Shanghai, and people have no rice to buy, causing great anxiety.</p>
<h3>Relief Grain Distribution in Nanshi Refugee Area</h3>
<p>Due to Father Jacquinot leaving Shanghai, the Nanshi Refugee Area will be closed at the end of this month. The office in the area is actively handling the repatriation procedures. It is stipulated that each repatriated refugee will be given one month's worth of relief grain, which began to be distributed yesterday. The distribution schedule and quantity are as follows: 6 days of grain (3 pounds of white rice) distributed on the 27th (i.e., yesterday), 9 days of grain (4.5 pounds) distributed on the 28th, 10 days of grain (5 pounds) distributed on the 29th, and 6 days of grain (3 pounds) distributed on the 30th. The distribution will be completed by the end of this month, totaling 31 days and 15.5 pounds. There are still about 19,000 refugees in the area receiving grain. Although the Aftercare Committee has stipulated that the elderly and weak should be transferred to the New Public Nursery, the nursery is limited in space and can only accommodate 400 to 500 people, so most of the refugees are being dispersed. It is understood that the Supervisory Committee and the General Office in charge of the area will be dissolved at the end of this month along with the dispersal of the refugees. Only the Aftercare Committee, headed by Xie Shibo, will temporarily maintain operations due to facilities such as the New Public Nursery, the First Hospital, and the Charity Maternity Hospital in the area.</p>
<h3>Japanese Banknote Issuance Doubled</h3>
<p>Since Japan launched its war of aggression against China, its domestic finances have been exhausted due to massive military spending, and the currency has become increasingly inflated. According to statistics at the end of March of this year, the total amount of banknotes issued in Japan was 3,024 million yen in Bank of Japan notes, 444.4 million yen in Bank of Korea notes, and 165 million yen in Bank of Taiwan notes. In addition, there were 24.6 million yen in subsidiary currency notes, bringing the total to 3,879 million yen, an increase of 121 million yen compared to last year, representing 45.3%. Since the "China Incident" in 1937, the inflation of the Japanese currency has increased by 94.50%, doubling. Compared to 1928, the inflation of the Japanese currency has been 225.80%. The inflation of the Japanese currency is clearly not for commercial application, as the circulation of checks on the market has not increased comparatively. Therefore, the inflation of the Japanese currency is purely due to the war.</p>
<h3>Payment of Principal and Interest on Consolidated Public Bonds to Begin</h3>
<p>Black Market Prices Soar</p>
<p>After the four banks, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Farmers Bank of China, discounted the ninth installment of principal and interest on the Consolidated Public Bonds of the Republic of China in 1936, the Central Bank and its entrusted banks will begin payment on July 31st. Due to the approaching date of principal and interest repayment and the government's determination to maintain credit, prices in the Shanghai securities black market have soared. Yesterday's closing prices were: Class A, 61.3 yuan, up 0.35 yuan; Class B, 51.8 yuan, up 0.2 yuan; Class C, 50.05 yuan, up 0.25 yuan; and Class E, 49.8 yuan, up 0.35 yuan.</p>
<h3>Last Batch of Mail from Paris Arrives in Shanghai by Ship</h3>
<p>Since the expansion of the European War, the situation in the Mediterranean has become tense, and shipping through the Suez Canal has been disrupted. Mail from Europe to Shanghai has been rerouted through the United States and shipped to Shanghai. The first batch arrived on the President Coolidge of the American President Lines on the 27th. According to a Daguang News Agency reporter's inquiry with the Postal Administration yesterday, the ship carried a total of 811 bags of mail for Shanghai, including 105 bags from Liverpool, England, and 22 bags from Paris, France, sealed and sent to Shanghai on May 6th. This is the last batch of mail before the fall of Paris and is of particular interest to the French community in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Wang Jiachen Uses Diversion to Steal Gold Jewelry and is Detained</h3>
<p>In a moment of desperation, he steals his uncle's property. Handed over to the police, he is ordered to post bail pending investigation.</p>
<p>Wang Jiachen, a young man from Ningbo, received a considerable education. Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, he ran a business in the Chinese area of Shanghai and was quite well-off. After the war, his family property was lost, and he has been unemployed ever since. He and his wife are trapped in a room at 47 Maizilu, Maizili, French Concession, and have been living on borrowed money for the past three years. He has borrowed from all his relatives and friends in Shanghai, but with the high cost of living and his wife about to give birth, he urgently needs money. He wanted to continue</p>
<p>Bothering his friends and relatives, but they were tired of it. In a moment of desperation, he remembered that his uncle, Shen Wenming, was still doing well, and his aunt, Mei Fang, was young and easily fooled. So, he bought a fake gold bracelet and, on the morning of the 21st of last month, while Shen was away from home, he suddenly went to Shen's residence at 54 Renzhili, Dongxi Huade Road, Hongkou. Mei Fang saw that her nephew was wearing a suit and leather shoes and did not look poor. She did not know that he was unemployed and did not suspect him. During the meeting, Wang suddenly took out the fake gold bracelet and asked her to appraise it. Mei Fang,</p>
<p>Although its brilliance was very bright, the weight did not seem right, so she opened the box and took out a real gold bracelet to compare. She confirmed that it was a fake. Wang immediately changed his tone and said that in addition to asking her to determine the authenticity of the jewelry, he wanted to move because a neighbor had extra rooms for rent. He asked her to accompany him to rent the room. Mei Fang agreed. When they arrived, Wang said that the room was too small to accommodate a bed and asked Shen's wife to stay there temporarily. He had to return home quickly to measure the bed. He then returned to Shen's house and falsely told the maid that he had left a pen in the room. He tricked her into giving him the key to the room and then gave the maid one yuan in legal tender and told her to go to the market to buy rope to measure the bed. He then opened the door and entered the room,</p>
<p>Secretly took a gold bracelet, two gold rings, bank passbooks, and title deeds from the box. He then sold the gold jewelry to a department store and a jewelry store on Nanjing Road. He immediately became wealthy. His wife gave birth shortly after, and he was praised by others for obtaining a job at 97 Yuangmingyuan Road. His fortunes changed. However, when Shen and his wife returned home that day, they discovered the theft. After questioning the maid, they suspected that it was their nephew, Wang Jiachen, who had done it. But they did not know his address and could not investigate. Recently, they heard about Wang's place of employment and tried to</p>
<p>Find him in the Yuangmingyuan Road area. They finally met him on the afternoon before yesterday. They immediately reported the incident to the Hongkou Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court for trial. The suspect confessed in court and repeatedly expressed remorse, saying that he was willing to compensate for the value of the gold jewelry and begged to be spared punishment so that his family of three could be spared. However, Shen Wenming and his wife said that the defendant's whereabouts were erratic, and if he were released, their losses would be unrecoverable. After examination by the presiding judge, it was decided that since the two parties were relatives, he would be lenient and ordered Wang Jiachen to find a reliable business guarantor to leave and await a summons at a later date.</p>
<h3>Gunshots on Park Road: Young Woman Wounded by Bullet</h3>
<p>At around 12:30 p.m. yesterday, a man named Jia and a friend walked out of the Park Road side door of the Four Lines Savings Society (across from the Carlton Theatre). As they were getting into his friend's car, just as the driver was starting the engine, a thug suddenly rushed forward, stuck a gun through the car window, and fired a shot. Fortunately, Jia and his friend were alert and quickly ducked, avoiding being hit. The bullet pierced a hole in the car. At that moment, a Shaoxing woman, Hua Zhang (36 years old, residing at 75 Hengchangli, South Chengdu Road), who had just left Cai Xiaoxiang's clinic after seeking medical treatment, was riding home in a rickshaw driven by Chen Jinjia (43 years old, residing in a flat at 53 Wuding Road, New Tokyo Road) from Jiangbei. The rickshaw was heading south at a fast pace when she was struck in the left chest by a stray bullet, which pierced her back. The bullet also injured rickshaw puller Chen Jinjia's left arm, causing him to bleed profusely. When a Chinese constable from 2025 arrived after hearing the gunshot, the thug had already disappeared. They summoned ambulance number 83 and sent the injured man and woman to Baolong Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Shen Weihui Sentenced for Falsely Accusing Someone of Murder; Suspended Sentence Granted Due to Youth and First Offense</h3>
<p>Shen Weihui (22 years old), from Chongming, who was formerly a teacher at Fenzhou Primary School on Fenzhou Road, was dismissed from his position by Gu Yansheng, the principal from Haimen, in January of this year because he often asked for leave. Shen harbored resentment and thought of revenge, but had no opportunity. Recently, he was introduced to work as</p>
<p>A teacher at the Lianyi Primary School at 57, Lane 208, Yangzhou Road. On the 13th of this month, he saw a newspaper report about the shocking dismemberment of a woman named Huang Jinxiu, who was killed out of jealousy. Shen then took the opportunity to write an English postcard, saying that Huang's death was instigated by Gu Yansheng, the principal of Fenzhou Primary School on Fenzhou Road, and that the writer of the postcard was responsible. He then mailed the postcard to the Yangshupu Police Station. Ji Xiucheng, the detective in charge of the case, went to Fenzhou School to investigate Gu and learned that it was Shen Weihui.</p>
<p>Shen was arrested for false accusation and two blank postcards, an ink bottle, and a pen were found in his home. He was taken to the First Special District Court for questioning. Prosecutor Jiang Shuzi presided over the Third Criminal Court hearing. Qian Xunjiu, the police lawyer, stated that Shen admitted in the police station that he did not know Huang Jinxiu and that he falsely accused her because Gu Yansheng, the principal of Fenzhou School, should not have refused to grant him two days of leave and had even</p>
<p>Shortened his salary by twelve yuan. Gu Yansheng then testified about the events and questioned the defendant's statement. At one point he was confused and wrote the English postcard and sent it to the police station, seeking leniency. Yan Fanggang, the defense lawyer, argued on his behalf. Judge Jiang declared to him that he was an intellectual and a teacher, and should not have falsely accused someone of such a serious crime as murder to vent his anger over a small matter. Considering that he was young and a first-time offender, he was sentenced to five months imprisonment, suspended for three years. The postcard, ink, and pen were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Rampant Banditry in Xujiahui District</h3>
<p>Extremely Active in the Lujiabang Area</p>
<p>According to reliable sources from the Dazhong News Agency, after the French defense forces and police automatically withdrew from the Xujiahui Cathedral area, bandits immediately took the opportunity to operate in the area, robbing wealthy families. Their activities were even more intense in the Lujiabang area on the 1st of this week. A Japanese spokesman denied this information at a press conference the day before yesterday, stating that after the Japanese official learned of this information, they immediately began investigating the truth, but the results did not confirm anything.</p>
<h3>Armed Robbery Fails, Resistance to Arrest Leads to Shooting</h3>
<p>Stray Bullet Wounds Two Passersby; Four Bandits Eventually Apprehended</p>
<p>At 10:30 p.m. last night, four bandits suddenly broke into the office of the Qian Fengyu Dyeing and Weaving Factory at 16, Lane 140, Fujian Road, Public Concession. Two of the bandits took out pistols to threaten the staff, intending to rob them. However, a staff member in the upstairs room shouted "Catch the thief!" and blew a whistle. The bandits heard the sound and knew that things were going wrong. Without robbing anything, they successively broke free and fled. As they reached the entrance of the lane, a patrolling constable passed by and, catching sight of the bandits, shouted at them to stop and attempted to search them. But the bandits immediately fired their guns to resist arrest. The constables also fired back. The bandits fired as they fled north along Fujian Road, pursued by the constables. Both sides fired multiple shots, and bullets flew everywhere. Passersby fled in all directions. At that time, two passersby, Zhu Wansen (32 years old, from Ningbo) and a woman, Yao Hongjie (28 years old, from Ningbo), were both struck in the right foot by stray bullets and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The bandits were pursued to the north of the Old Zhabei Bridge, where they disappeared into the darkness. After the investigation, the constables summoned an ambulance and sent the two injured to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Mr. Feng Bingnan's Birthday Ode to His Mother (I): Expounding the Essence of the Eight Virtues Rooted in Utmost Filial Piety; Advocating Thrift and Initiative as the Foundation of the Eight Virtues</h3>
<p>Last night at 9 o'clock, Mr. Feng Bingnan's fourth son, Zhenwei, delivered a speech on the essential meanings of the Five Teachings on behalf of his respected father at the New Star Radio Station. It was extremely important for social welfare. Therefore, we have specially transcribed it as follows:</p>
<p>June 29th is the 70th birthday of my mother. Starting from the 29th, a series of five lectures on the Five Teachings will be held at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA for five consecutive days from 5:30 PM to 7:30 PM (new time); that is, June 29, June 30, July 1, July 2, and July 3. We are very honored and grateful that Mr. Jiang Zhuzhuang and several other gentlemen have enthusiastically agreed to be the main speakers. Originally, I should have personally attended the meeting to greet everyone and thank the guest speakers and attending guests. However, since I fell ill in the 26th year, I have not yet recovered, and I am still unable to move freely, or even sit in a car, so I cannot come out in person. I am very sorry. Some say that since my health is not good, I should stay at home and take care of myself and not hold these Five Teachings lectures and other things. I should first find a way to restore my health. However, I believe that matters beneficial to the public cannot wait for the health of an individual. If one believes that something is indeed beneficial to the public, one should quickly do it because there is no guarantee when health will return. If one waits until one is healthy, it will be a long time. I believe that the Five Teachings lectures being held now are the best way to commemorate my mother's birthday. My feeling that society needs to be improved did not begin this year. I have had this idea for many years, but when I was young, I was busy trying to become self-reliant, and in middle age, I was serving various businesses. I really did not have any free time to spare. Therefore, although I have always had this in mind for the past two or three decades, I have always felt that I lacked the time and ability, so I have been unable to find a concrete way to realize this aspiration. Since the 26th year, I have been spending 50-60% of my time in bed, and my body and mind have been relatively free. I have used this leisure time to organize the unsystematic ideas that I have accumulated in my mind for decades and plan how to improve society. Gradually, it became more concrete and systematic. However, every time I planned a method, after three or four days, I would find various shortcomings, so I had to reconsider and study it from the beginning. This has happened countless times. It was not until recently that I felt it was more meticulous and progressive. However, I still do not dare to be completely confident or certain. It can only be regarded as a rough prototype. This year happens to be my mother's 70th birthday. I will take this opportunity to realize what I have learned in the past few years, whether I can do it independently or whether I need the help of others, as a commemoration of my mother's birthday. The decision is because I have been living in society for more than half a century, and I have received so much from society. I should repay society. The Five Teachings lectures are one of the plans. There are others, which I will talk about later.</p>
<p>The kindness of our parents in nurturing and raising us is as boundless as the sky. When the elderly have a major birthday, as children and grandchildren, we should of course think about making them happy and doing something memorable for them. What is the best way to commemorate? What will make the elderly happy? Regarding commemorating parents' birthdays, there are many ready-made methods in the world. If I were to simply copy them, I would not have to bother to plan. The general worldly methods are probably nothing more than banquets with relatives and friends, or singing performances, or buying things that the elderly like. I think these methods are all appropriate because a person's filial thoughts towards their parents are a matter of the heart. Since we want our parents to enjoy our filial piety, we naturally need to express it outwardly. Therefore, banquets, entertainment, etc., are all expressions of filial piety and are methods that most people are willing to adopt. However, my situation is a bit different. I have always preferred quietness to activity, and I am not good at socializing. I think it is better to use a more lasting method than to adopt superficial formalities as a commemoration. Moreover, my mother is inherently indifferent and quiet and does not like pomp. She has repeatedly instructed me to keep things simple and not to disturb relatives and friends. In addition, the current situation is extremely difficult, and many people are suffering, so it is definitely not appropriate to be extravagant. This is why I dare not agree with the world in commemorating my mother's 70th birthday.</p>
<h3>Reason for the Assassination of Tram Inspector Chen Guohua</h3>
<p>Diligent Exposure of Ticket Sellers' Embezzlement Leads to Accumulated Hatred and Tragic Death. More Than 20 Accomplices Arrested</p>
<p>Chen Guohua, a ticket inspector of the French Tram Company No. 5, a native of Zhabei, was shot and killed on the afternoon of the 25th at the intersection of Avenue du Père Robert and Rue Massenet. The details have been reported in this newspaper. According to a report from the China News Agency reporter, after the incident, in addition to the murderer Lu Rucheng being wounded and captured on the spot, Lv Tiancheng (mistakenly reported as Li Tiancheng yesterday), a ticket seller of No. 304, and Wang Yongqing, a ticket seller of No. 276, were also arrested. The police have found that dozens of people are involved in the case, most of whom are ticket sellers of the tram company. As of yesterday, a total of 25 people have been arrested. It is also learned that the main criminals in the case, ticket sellers No. 177 and No. 158, have fled after hearing the news and are now being hunted. It is also rumored that the reason for the bloodshed was entirely because Chen was diligent in his work and, when checking tickets, exposed the fraudulent tickets of as many as 60 people in one day. He reported them to the company, without any leniency. The company promoted him to his current position because of his loyalty, but at the same time, it also led to deep hatred and tragic death. It is rumored that the murderer of the bloodshed obtained a large sum of money, which was contributed by the accomplices in the case, each paying five yuan, and signing their names in a notebook. Therefore, the police authorities were able to solve the case quickly.</p>

<h3>Finance: The Selling Momentum of Foreign Exchange is Increasing</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC posting prices without any fluctuations. The dark market for British and American exchange rates was quite loose. Except for China Bank, which initially still had demand, speculators from Hong Kong Electric sold aggressively. A certain atmosphere was very rampant, coupled with selling pressure. In the morning, the spot US dollar had already reached 6.125 yuan. The selling momentum in the aftermarket was even stronger. China Bank also turned from buying to selling.

The silver balancing tax increased by 0.50%. After that, although Hong Kong Electric also sold aggressively, China Bank began to buy, and the loosening trend slowed down slightly. The June US dollar was purchased by China Bank, East Asia, Zhejiang Industrial, etc. from Hong Kong Electric for 6.125 yuan. Speculators sold July for 6 yuan to foreign firms. Later, because China Bank's appetite was quite strong, the spot US dollar reached 6.09375 yuan. However, at noon, foreign firms traded the spot US dollar again at 6.125 yuan, and foreign firms' selling intentions were strong. The noon closing was still hard, with British gold at 3 shillings 9.0625 pence and the US dollar at 6.125 yuan, which were 0.03125 pence and 0.09375 yuan higher than the morning opening for British gold and the US dollar, respectively.</p>

<h3>Gold Market's Downturn Intensifies</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market, in both official and unofficial trading, showed a flat and weak trend. Although there were some minor fluctuations, the number of rises and falls was still small. More selling than buying among operators was influenced by a certain atmosphere in the market, and the loose foreign exchange quotations made it even more difficult for prices to rise. The morning opening was 5,500 yuan, but it fell to 5,420 yuan due to initial selling by both gold and silver firms. Some retail investors had the urge to buy at low prices, and the price was briefly pulled up by 50 yuan. Ultimately, due to selling pressure from money changers, it fell back down again. The noon closing was 5,430 yuan. The sentiment was poor when the market opened in the afternoon. Silver firms once absorbed an opening price of 5,410 yuan, reversing up 20 yuan. Subsequently, gold firms, money changers, and retail investors unanimously took action to liquidate their positions for the day, resulting in a disastrous drop below the 5,400 yuan mark before the close, reaching a low price of 5,350 yuan. The closing price was ultimately 5,400 yuan, still 100 yuan lower than the previous day. The total transaction volume was about 3,000 taels. Jewelry gold was quoted 10 yuan lower by silver shops, while customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Dropped by 100 Yuan Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially showed a stable situation due to flat foreign exchange quotations. The opening price was no different from the previous day. Silver firms traded with each other at 5,500 yuan. Subsequently, due to competitive selling by silver firms, gold firms also followed suit and sold aggressively. At the same time, the foreign exchange market was hardening, and there was a lack of buyers, resulting in a price drop of 80 yuan. Gold firms sold 20 taels to silver firms at a price of 5,420 yuan. Then, with support from securities firms, money changers, and retail investors, the price briefly recovered by 50 yuan. Silver firms bought 30 taels from gold firms at 5,470 yuan. Ultimately, due to the continued loosening trend of foreign exchange, there were many sellers at high prices. One silver firm in particular exerted a strong selling force, pushing the price down another 55 yuan. Money changers traded 10 taels at 5,415 yuan. Selling pressure eased slightly before the close, and the price rose again by 15 yuan. Money changers bought 10 taels from gold firms at 5,430 yuan, which was the closing price for the noon session. The market was quite weak when it opened in the afternoon, dropping by 20 yuan. Securities firms sold 10 taels to money changers, retreating to 5,410 yuan. Subsequently, silver firms bought in, reversing up 20 yuan. Silver firms bought 20 taels from securities firms at 5,430 yuan. Later, the hardening of the foreign exchange market triggered selling pressure. Gold firms and money changers sold to each other, and long positions in silver firms were also liquidated, resulting in another drop of 80 yuan. Silver firms sold 20 taels to money changers at 5,350 yuan. After that, the number of sellers decreased, and one silver firm showed strong buying interest, again increasing its absorption. Gold firms sold 20 taels to silver firms at 5,410 yuan. Later, securities firms sold 30 taels to silver firms and others, retreating again to 5,400 yuan, the evening closing price. As a result, the price dropped by 100 yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 150 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of spot gold for gold firms' own brand was several tens of yuan higher than the spot gold price, while the buying price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current gold standard price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there was little trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Traded at 550 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael in silver shops was initially 560 yuan at Dahantong, but at 3:15 PM, it was reduced by 10 yuan. Dahantong changed its quote to 550 yuan. The new colleagues' selling price was the same as before. The buying price was reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw spot gold fluctuating downward. British gold pounds and American gold pounds also fell by 3 yuan each. British gold notes fell by 0.3 yuan due to the loosening of the black market British exchange rate and a slight increase in supply. American gold notes fell due to the rise in the black market American exchange rate. The public rushed to sell, and the market price fell, once retreating to 16.25 yuan. Eventually, it recovered slightly to 16.3 yuan, still 0.27 yuan lower than the previous day. Hong Kong notes fell and then rose, ultimately continuing to rise by 0.02 yuan. Canadian notes and Philippine notes were still plentiful in supply, and the market price uniformly continued to weaken. Demand for Japanese gold notes did not decrease, and the evening price was 1.1 yuan. The supply and demand for Korean notes were balanced, and the evening price was still 0.975 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow is the Banks' Half-Year Settlement; Check Clearing Extended</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association Clearing Committee yesterday issued a circular to all clearing banks, stating, "It has been verified that June 29 (Saturday) is the date for the banking industry's half-year settlement. In order to facilitate the collection and transfer of funds by fellow banks, the clearing time on this day will be appropriately extended, set from 4:45 PM. The time for collecting checks will remain the same." According to the original clearing time, it was 3:30 PM, which is a delay of one hour and fifteen minutes.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Market Turns Around; Type C Breaks Through the 50 Yuan Mark; British Bank Shares Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday's off-market trading of securities saw a sudden rise in market prices. A certain bank bought hundreds of thousands, suddenly making the weak debt market shake. A certain atmosphere was strong, and trading also increased sharply. The market's chips suddenly appeared depleted. General retail investors were quite short covering, but large short positions remained unmoved. This kind of price rise was mostly due to the upcoming interest payment and the banks' half-year settlement. The so-called certain atmosphere was still just speculation. Yesterday morning, Yongfenghao bought about 300,000 of Types C and E on behalf of a certain bank, and the market sentiment suddenly strengthened. Type E lacked strength due to the emergence of the 20th day bulls. Yongkang supplied 100,000 of Type A, which was absorbed by Lemao. The remaining Lienyi and the 16th showed some demand and were sold by Lianhe. In the afternoon, Types C and E were traded more, so the price rise suddenly became strong. Type A had the fewest sellers, so the price rise was also strong. The market price had broken through 61 yuan. Type C also broke through the 50 yuan mark, and the situation was very good, but it was impossible to predict whether it would continue. The market price results, except for Type D, which was still not opened, the rest all rose by 0.2 to 0.35 yuan. The transaction volume was more than 1 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 30 shares of Kangyuan Canning Factory stock were traded at a price of 9 yuan per share. According to this type of stock, the face value is 10 yuan.</p>
<p>The operators' interest in the stock market of the Public Association of Various Industries was still very weak. The price changes were minimal, and the transaction volume was scarce.</p>
<p>London, 26th (Wednesday) - Today's listed prices for Far East British companies' stocks saw bank shares continue to fall. The rest remained flat. Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China shares continued to fall by 2 shillings and 6 pence, with a price of 6 pounds. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation shares fell sharply by 5 pounds, with the London registered shares at 55 pounds and the Hong Kong registered shares at 60 pounds. The Mercantile Bank of India shares fell by 5 shillings, with a price of 11 pounds and 5 shillings.</p>
<p>London, 26th (Wednesday) - Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt remained stable. There were no changes in the prices of any of the bonds.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Difficult to Support Alone; Yarn Prices Plummet; Shuangma at a Low of 885 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially remained flat and then fell. The trend was still weak. This was because actual sales were not smooth, and Shanghai's transportation was still difficult. Therefore, the Hong Kong gangs were unable to do anything, and morale was low. Therefore, although the Shenxin Factory was doing its best to maintain the market and continued to buy, there were very many sellers. The factory, in view of its inability to support the building alone, stopped buying. As a result, the limit price of 950 yuan fell directly to 885 yuan. Then, with some buying, it returned to the edge of 900 yuan.</p>
<p>The morning opening of the spot yarn market saw that morale was already scattered. There were more sellers than buyers. The asking price for 20-count Shuangma was 947 yuan, and everyone held their ground without making a deal. Shortly after, someone from the Shenxin Factory called out 950 yuan for buying in the market. As a result, sellers came one after another, with quantities of more than 50 bales. The factory saw that the chips on the table were full and stopped buying. Retail investors sold out, and the market price dropped, falling to 865 yuan. However, the closing price was slightly higher as someone bought in, and it rose back to 900 yuan. According to the statistics of transactions during the half-day, 2,240 bales were traded. The Shuangma price fell by 66 yuan. Today, 283 pieces of yarn were shipped to Yantai, 105 pieces were shipped to Tianjin, and 10 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount bought by each gang is listed below.</p>
<h3>Cotton: Japanese Factories Slightly Active</h3>
<p>The spot cotton market has completely entered a standstill. The reason is that the yarn market has fallen sharply, causing factories to wait and see. Therefore, there are no transactions in this cotton market. However, there is a group that is extremely willing to concede a sharp drop, but there are few buyers.</p>
<p>In other news, the spot price of foreign cotton saw the New York cotton market was very firm and exceptionally active. Spot traders and Wall Street purchases resulted in closing prices that were 19 points higher for near-term and 10 points higher for far-term compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market, along with forecasts, did not fluctuate much.</p>
<p>The trade of foreign cotton in Shanghai was very quiet among Chinese manufacturers. However, Japanese factories were very active. Yesterday, they purchased more than 1,000 bales of spot cotton, but the payment period was mostly at the end of July, which was due to the high price of Japanese yarn and the active sales of yarn. The industry's intentions have therefore turned for the better.</p>
<p>Another large batch of Indian cotton has arrived in Shanghai. The former Yajiya Shipping Company's Sassiya (transliteration) ship arrived in port the day before yesterday, carrying 6,000 pieces of cotton from Calcutta, and docked at Qichang Pier in Pudong to unload.</p>
<h3>The Demise of the Golden Age of Yarn Factories</h3>
<p>— Island Guest</p>
<p>Everyone knows that nearly two months ago, the highest peak of 20-count yarn was 1,800 to 1,900 yuan (a record-breaking new record per piece). Speculators desperately pushed up yarn prices, thinking that having a few pieces of yarn in their hands meant they could be carefree and powerful, with the prospect of eating endlessly for life, and even less worry about becoming a wealthy person. They were making sacrifices for the yarn factories and creating opportunities for the yarn factory industry to make huge profits. When the market price was 1,800 to 1,900 yuan and 1,600 to 1,700 yuan, the total cost of raw materials and expenses for yarn factories was only about 1,000 yuan (this refers to Shuangma yarn, and other yarns were not much different). So, didn't each piece of yarn have a huge profit of 800 to 900 yuan or 600 to 700 yuan? However, that opportunity for huge profits passed like lightning! In mid-May, foreign exchange rose sharply, and unfavorable news about the Allied forces in the European war came frequently. Telegraphs about Indian cotton and American cotton showed a sharp decline (benefiting short sellers' overseas long selling). As a result, the Shanghai yarn market went from 1,400 to 1,500 yuan, to 1,200 to 1,300 yuan, to about 1,100 yuan, and... yesterday (the 27th) it fell again and again due to the bad news that coastal defense could not be transferred, initially opening at 950 yuan for Shuangma yarn, then falling to 850 to 860 yuan, and finally closing at 880 yuan after a small rebound. Each fall was always close to 100 yuan. Although a certain large yarn factory launched a strong force and bought 3,000 to 4,000 bales of Shuangma yarn to maintain the market price (this shows the seriousness of the yarn factory's internal panic), the eyes of those experienced in the business world, under the realistic environment, can always see more falling than rising, benefiting short positions rather than long positions. Moreover, in reality, sales to Hong Kong and other groups are pitiful (only 100 to 200 bales per day). According to a certain gentleman who goes to the yarn market every day, the miracle in the market yesterday (the 27th) was that the Hong Kong gangs not only did not buy in, but continued to sell. Thus, the foothold of yarn prices and the future of the yarn market can be imagined!</p>
<p>According to the current yarn price of 800 yuan, yarn factories will lose as much as 200 yuan per piece. The raw material for yarn factories—cotton—has mostly been purchased in advance (bought when it was expensive). The cost of raw materials for each load of 20-count yarn must be about 230 to 240 yuan. Calculating 350 jin of cotton per piece, the cost of raw materials alone is 830 to 40 yuan, plus at least 170 to 180 yuan for the expenses of each piece. The sum of these two items means that the manufacturing cost is more than 1,000 yuan. If a large yarn factory produces 200 pieces of yarn (20-count) every day and night, it will lose about 30,000 yuan. If this trend of falling yarn prices lasts for a month, a large-scale yarn factory with a large public reserve fund may still be able to cope with a monthly loss of 1 million yuan? (Perhaps it will also feel stretched?) As for many small-scale yarn factories, they can only close down. According to a certain gentleman who told me, a certain large yarn factory has already lost as much as 5 million yuan in the sharp drop in raw materials (cotton) and market prices. The number of yarn firms going bankrupt and liquidating at the end of this month will probably be even more shocking!</p>
<h3>Grain: Hoarders Emerge, Rice Prices Continue to Fall by Approximately One Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, when the rice market initially opened, sellers, having been left in a lurch from the previous dynasty, were unwilling to easily let go. Supported by price maintenance, the situation was relatively firm, and the prices of various types of foreign rice were once raised by more than half a yuan. However, sales were sluggish. In addition to the halt of purchases by inland merchants, there were few inquiries from rural villages and local streets, causing prices to quickly return to stability. Moreover, many floating hoarders and small-scale speculators had no intention of holding on, and quite a few emerged to sell. This was compounded by the arrival of 15,000 to 16,000 bags of new rice, and various pre-arranged batches were also about to arrive in Shanghai. Meanwhile, local consumption was weak, and inland merchants were about to fulfill their quotas using transportation permits. New permits were expensive, making transportation unprofitable. Additionally, the continuous rainfall had calmed people's minds, and inland rice prices had already started to decline. New hoarders also dared not absorb more rice. Although some trading firms remained determined to hold on, the trend suggested that the market would be forced to decline. Yesterday, the selling prices of all types of rice uniformly decreased. No. 2 Saigon rice initially opened at 61 yuan in the morning market but closed at only 60 yuan and 2.5 jiao in the evening. No. 2 Siam rice was initially 60 yuan and 5 fen in the morning but 59 yuan and 5 jiao in the evening. Small-kernel rice was initially 60 yuan and 3 jiao in the morning but 59 yuan and 4 jiao in the evening. All were about one yuan lower than the previous evening. Trading in repossessed goods halted. 150 tons of repossessed No. 2 Siam rice, packed on the 18th, were offered at prices ranging from 67 yuan and 5 jiao to 67 yuan and 3 jiao. More than 5,000 bags of spot rice were offered.</p>
<p>Due to the all-day rain the day before, there were no arrivals of Japonica and glutinous domestic rice. On the sales side, whether openly or secretly, rumors indicated poor sales. However, sellers remained firm due to the lack of arrivals, resulting in the same selling prices as before.</p>
<h3>Flour Only Sold Locally; Wheat Prices Drop Due to Rain</h3>
<p>Flour trading was quite active, but only for small-scale local sales. This was because rice prices were currently high, and the demand from ordinary people was increasing. The sliced noodle industry association requested an increase in supply, and it is reported that the factories have accepted. Throughout the day, the two factories distributed a total of 14,000 to 15,000 bags. The price of No. 2 flour from the factories continued to be 14 yuan and 7 jiao, while repossessed flour was priced at 15 yuan and 4 or 5 jiao. Future flour from Japanese factories had been offered at over 16 yuan and 6 jiao. Furthermore, 1,200 bags of flour were being shipped to Yantai today.</p>
<p>The source of new wheat continued with three to four thousand bags being transported from the Beijing-Wuhu area, but these were not formally imported goods. The transportation issues for Chinese merchants have not yet been effectively resolved. However, after the rainfall, although the production price has been reported as slightly lower, the miscellaneous fees and taxes have increased, so the price of new wheat still needs to be above 23 yuan and 5 jiao to 24 yuan. It is also heard that the Fufeng factory purchased five to six hundred bags of Zhenjiang wheat at a price of 24 yuan and 3 jiao.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Supply Dries Up; Bean Cakes Become More Popular</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the bean cake market, although initially facing transportation difficulties due to the morning rain, still saw brisk sales. Therefore, there were no significant changes in the market. Later, trading firms learned that the supply of soybeans was extremely scarce and that new supplies were not arriving. As a result, they tried their best to bring in supplies, making the market even more lively. As a result, prices jumped another 3 jiao. However, due to the shortage of spot goods, most transactions were for future delivery. The factories, anticipating future high prices of 14 to 15 yuan, dared not oversupply. Yesterday, the total transaction volume was 14,000 to 15,000 cakes of Dayou brand bean cake, with spot prices at 13 yuan and 5 or 6 jiao and delivery in the first half of July priced at 13 yuan and 3 to 6 jiao. 5,000 cakes of Shengji brand were traded, with spot prices at 12 yuan and 9 jiao to 13 yuan, and July delivery at 13 yuan and 1 jiao. Eight cartloads of Yuanlong brand cakes were traded, with spot prices at 12 yuan and 7 jiao to 13 yuan, and July delivery also at 13 yuan. Seven cartloads of Feizi brand cakes were traded, with spot prices at 13 yuan and July delivery at 13 yuan and 1 jiao, and 1,000 cakes of Qingzhong brand were traded at 12 yuan and 1.5 jiao.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 1,852 tins of raw oil and 280 pieces arrived from Yantai, and 200 pieces came from Qingdao. Today, 500 tins of raw oil, 2,000 pieces of bean cake, and 795 bags of beans were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Southwest Transportation Disrupted, Cotton Cloth Sales Suddenly Clear</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw initial stability followed by declines due to weak sentiment. Actual sales were relatively strong in local streets and various guerrilla areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. Sales to the southwestern Guangdong and Yunnan areas sharply decreased. The selling prices of coarse and fine cloth and twill fell by 5 jiao to 1 yuan per bolt, and bleached and dyed cloth also fell by about 1 yuan. Merchants from the Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Taizhou areas purchased over one hundred pieces of coarse twill colored cloth. Guerrilla areas in Jiangsu, Hangzhou, Anhui, and northern and southern regions purchased over ten thousand bolts of blue cloth, coarse cloth, colored twill, and other goods. Local merchants purchased over twenty thousand bolts of various grey fabrics and bleached and dyed cloths. Hoarders also absorbed some when prices were low.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth prices continued to fall, and sentiment became even weaker. Sellers were eager to sell, but buyers were scarce. Therefore, high-quality Longtou fine cloth initially opened at 31 yuan and 3 jiao in the morning but quickly fell to 30 yuan and 5 fen. Later, outside the market, prices started at 30 yuan, then plummeted to 28 yuan and 7.5 jiao. The ups and downs were large, with small rebounds in between, and the situation was still difficult to stabilize. Sijunzi serge once rose to 9 jiao, but ultimately fell back to 8 jiao, 4 fen and 5 li at the close due to sluggish actual sales.</p>
<p>Another report indicated that the recent sluggish sales of piece goods and cotton yarn to merchants were due to news from the shipping industry that merchants from the Beiyang region were stagnant because the Japanese puppet government in Tianjin would implement control over the import of piece goods and cotton yarn starting on July 1. Merchants from the Nanhua region, seeing the tense situation regarding Vietnam, had all stopped purchasing. As a result, exports had significantly decreased.</p>
<p>Today, 228 pieces of piece goods were exported to Yantai, 48 pieces were exported to Tianjin, and 17 pieces were exported to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse White Loosens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was weak and showed signs of decline. The guild's benchmark price for spot 24 coarse white sugar was initially 68 yuan and 5 jiao to 2 jiao at foreign firms, but later fell slightly to 68 yuan, a drop of 6 jiao in total. Transshipment for delivery on July 2 was 54 yuan and 9 jiao to 55 yuan and 3 jiao, while ready-made documents were 54 yuan and 5 jiao to 2 jiao. Taikoo Caster White was relatively cheaper, with B mark still at 79 yuan and 5 jiao and Dutch Red at 59 yuan and 4 jiao. For domestic sugar, merchants from Guangdong offered 70 bags of high-quality Hainan Red at 51 yuan and 5 jiao, but there were few transactions.</p>
<h3>Qian Hu Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Qian Hu is produced in the mountains bordering Zhejiang and Anhui provinces and is an essential medicine for treating illnesses in the summer and autumn. Last winter, due to weather and human factors, production was only half of that in previous years, making harvesting and transportation very difficult. It is reported that Yuji Shenzhuang on Baike Road sent personnel to the production area in the spring and secured seventy to eighty percent of the total amount. The first two batches have already been shipped to Hong Kong and resold to the South Seas Islands. Various grades of spot goods have now arrived in warehouses and are awaiting sale.</p>

<h3>Korean Ginseng</h3>
<p>After Korea became a vassal of our dynasty, it was stipulated that they would offer tributes three times every year for internal affairs and five times for external affairs. Later, due to the frequent travels, it was ordered that the tributes be combined into one. When they came to the capital, there were eight envoys, with the head being the tribute envoy, and the rest were named from Two Great Officials to Eight Great Officials, probably the deputy envoy and accompanying personnel. In addition to the tribute goods, the main item traded with China was Korean ginseng, each package weighing about ten catties. They were only allowed to trade with the six major firms in the capital, and these six firms would then distribute them to pharmacies in various provinces, prefectures, and counties. Chinese merchants and civilians were not allowed to trade privately, and even Korean merchants and civilians were not allowed to bring ginseng out of customs privately. After the ginseng was handed over to the six major firms, no payment was received immediately. Instead, there was a separate list for these six firms to purchase Chinese silk, satin, gauze, and writing materials. The accounts would be reconciled when the Korean envoys came to the capital the following year. This was the old practice. Last year, the Governor-General of Zhili reported that Korean merchants were selling ginseng after entering the country. The Ministry then investigated and found that although Korean tribute envoys were exempt from taxes on all goods they brought, they should only trade at the Bureau of Translators, etc., and were not allowed to sell in the interior. However, if border residents impersonated Koreans, local officials should investigate and deal with them. If they were indeed followers of the tribute envoys who were loitering in the interior, they should be sent to the Ministry and then to their home country for investigation.</p>

<h3>Key Points for Further Education - A Contribution to High School Graduates -</h3>
<p>— Qian Jiajun</p>
<p>Last Wednesday afternoon, I went to the YWCA on Jing'an Temple Road to listen to a two-hour lecture on guidance for further education. The lecture was given by Mr. Wang, the Dean of Academics at Soochow University, whose well-organized explanation was indeed very helpful in terms of our choices for further education. I feel that this series of lectures on further education organized by the YWCA is like a beacon for us high school graduates, guiding each of us on the path we should take. However, recently, most graduates of various schools are preparing for graduation exams, and due to time constraints, some may not be able to attend the lectures. Therefore, I will write down the general points Mr. Wang made below for the reference of students from various schools who were unable to attend.</p>
<p>"Before the arrival of summer vacation, middle schools usually guide students on the issue of further education after graduation, just like choosing a suitable husband (i.e., a university) for a daughter who is about to be married. Now you are about to leave your mother's home, and at the same time, we university authorities are also busy preparing to welcome you, a group of new brides." At the beginning, Mr. Wang used this humorous metaphor to highlight the importance of guidance for further education. Then, he divided the following into four points to explain:</p>
<p>(1) Learning Skills Needed by Society</p>
<p>No one will deny that the day China achieves final victory will also be the day construction begins; in other words, a new China must be built from the ashes of the war. At that time, a large number of technical personnel will be urgently needed. Therefore, the best subjects to choose to study are skills that are more needed by society. Then, whether speaking from the perspective of personal prospects or national interests, it is a win-win situation.</p>
<p>(2) Matching One's Intelligence and Interests</p>
<p>Precisely because of the need for construction talents, most young students, in order to be able to serve the country more actively in the future, are filled with the cry of "applying for science and engineering subjects." However, some people simply don't realize that their teaching often gets a Zero mark, or that they are used to "duck eggs" in physics. Even if they manage to get in, they will feel overwhelmed after studying for a semester and will switch departments. This kind of trouble is the result of erroneous ideas, because other subjects such as literature, law, and business also have their own values. As long as they match one's talents and interests, there will definitely be satisfactory results, which is much better than "forcing a cow to eat horse grass."</p>
<p>(3) Choosing a Department at a School</p>
<p>In the United States, experts have thoroughly investigated universities across the country and created statistical tables showing which departments at each school are the best and which are worse, so that those preparing to apply to universities can understand at a glance. China does not yet have such statistics. Now, we can only rely on our own investigation, and we must not adopt the principle of haphazardly taking exams and belittle this important issue.</p>
<p>(4) Paying Attention to the School's Environment and Atmosphere</p>
<p>The environment is the shell of the school; the school atmosphere is the soul of the school. Because the school is where students train their intellect, exercise their physique, and cultivate their personality, it must have a good environment in order to have a better education. Regarding the school atmosphere, for example, whether the feelings among students are harmonious, and whether teachers and staff work together with students in harmony, these can all affect students' studies.</p>
<p>Other things, such as whether the school is registered; what the prospects of previous graduates are; and the equipment in the school, etc., Mr. Wang guided in detail one by one. Due to space constraints, I will not write much here. Finally, I hope that all students will be successful in their applications.</p>
<h3>Nine Prohibitions for Seeking Employment</h3>
<p>— Liang</p>
<p>When you are summoned by the shop owner you have longed to meet for a long time to talk, you must remember to pay attention to the following nine points:</p>
<p>(1) Do not show a panicked or extremely flustered appearance.</p>
<p>(2) The volume of your speech does not need to be too high, nor should it be too fast, so as not to disturb your composure.</p>
<p>(3) Do not tell him all of your difficulties completely.</p>
<p>(4) Do not talk about irrelevant idle talk.</p>
<p>(5) Do not speak in too much detail, so as not to arouse the other party's disgust.</p>
<p>(6) Do not ask some confused questions.</p>
<p>(7) Do not say to the shop owner, "I will definitely work hard."</p>
<p>(8) Do not say to the shop owner that if he hires you, he will get great benefits.</p>
<p>(9) Do not try to control the other party. (Translated from World Digest, March-April issue)</p>
<h3>Exploiters in the Midst of "Daylight Saving Time"</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>I am a worker at the ×× Weaving and Dyeing Factory. I go to work at six o'clock every morning and leave work at six o'clock in the afternoon, working a full twelve hours every day. The price I get is at most nine corners a day. Just think, in this metropolis where everything is skyrocketing, after deducting five corners for food and the necessary miscellaneous expenses, how much is left?</p>
<p>Recently, because the market feels a little sluggish, the factory has stopped night work, and a notice dismissed more than thirty male and female workers, adding a new batch of unemployed people to society. I am fortunate that I have not been laid off, but all the harsh treatments are enough to endure.</p>
<p>From June 1st, various places are following daylight saving time. Our factory cannot be an exception. Originally, twelve hours of animalistic work was already hard enough, but now we have to add another hour of work for no reason, to do thirteen hours of work. Mr. Editor, is this what is called the principle of implementing daylight saving time? Therefore, I am using your publication to expose this, hoping that the capitalists will take into account the health and lives of us workers, and save our suffering masses!</p>
<p>(Editor's Note: After the implementation of the new clock time on the first of this month, we received a letter from a reader who believes that this "movement" has no meaning at all, except to benefit the second landlords. His example is: the second landlord has turned off the lights at twelve o'clock according to the new clock time. Regarding the meaning of the "daylight saving time" movement, several authors in this publication have already expressed their opinions, so I will not repeat them. The big second landlords in this city are truly ubiquitous after the war, and they will naturally not easily let go of this excellent opportunity. However, the evening is the time for sleep, and turning off the lights one hour earlier is not as harmful to the third tenants as raising the rent, so that letter was not published. But yesterday, we received another letter from a worker who said that the owner of the weaving and dyeing factory where he works is also taking this opportunity to increase the working hours of the workers. This not only does not conform to the true meaning of the authorities' promotion of the "daylight saving time" movement, but is actually engaged in exploiting the workers' rest time, which is really too "that." The publication of this letter is obviously of no help to the workers, but humans who have life are always equipped with the empathy that humans should have. In case it has a subtle effect, I wish the factory good business on behalf of all the workers.)</p>
<p>Hawthorne Detective Cases</p>
<h3>The Homecoming of the Dance Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Two "A Page of History!"</p>
<p>Hawthorne nodded again. "What happened after you got out of bed?"</p>
<p>"I immediately put on a coat and went to knock on Mr. Li's door in the next room. He was also awakened. He opened the door, and I accompanied him downstairs. As soon as we walked into this reception room, we saw Miss Wang in this terrible state." Her gaze once again made contact with the corpse.</p>
<p>Hawthorne took the cigarette out of his mouth and asked, "At that time, was the door of this reception room open or closed?"</p>
<p>"Open. Because I remember that as soon as I walked downstairs, I saw the light here shining on the corridor outside."</p>
<p>"What about this window?" He pointed to the steel bar window in front of the desk with his hand.</p>
<p>"Also open, still like this."</p>
<p>"Okay, what happened next?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Li panicked and said he wanted to call the police station. I had no idea either. At that time, the gatekeeper, Old Mao, also came in from outside with a coat on. He stood on the stone steps at the main entrance and suddenly shouted loudly!"</p>
<p>"Shouted what?"</p>
<p>"He shouted 'Footprints! Footprints!' I followed Mr. Li back to the outer corridor and saw that Old Mao had turned on the light at the main entrance and was pointing at the mud footprints on the floor inside the door in a daze. Mr. Li called Old Mao in. He shook his head first and refused, then he went back to the gatehouse to get a few planks and laid them on top of the footprints before carefully walking in step by step from the wooden planks."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou, who had been silently writing in his notebook, seemed to be unable to bear the silence anymore when he heard this. He stopped writing and said to himself, "Strange, how could Old Mao see these mud footprints as so important?"</p>
<p>Jinmei suddenly answered automatically. "He probably already knew that Miss Wang had been beaten to death. Because when Mr. Li walked in, he would shout in panic: 'Oh! Who beat her to death? Who beat her to death?' Old Mao must have heard it outside."</p>
<p>Hawthorne didn't make any criticism, but urged Jinmei to continue. (28)</p>
<h3>Shaoxing Correspondence</h3>
<p>— Zhuchang</p>
<p>Brother ××: This is indeed a tragic scene. Since the fall of Xiaoshan, our hometown has also been ravaged by invaders once. Although it was only a fleeting moment, the traffic on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was cut off as a result, and the source of rice and grain gradually became scarce. Shaoxing, which originally relied on imported rice and grain as its staple food, naturally did not have enough local production to meet the needs of the people. As a result, the price of rice rose again and again, until it reached one hundred and ten yuan per stone. Now the people have no means of living, and more and more people are starving to death. In addition, there has been no rain for several months, the riverbeds are dry, the fields are cracked, and epidemics are rampant as a result. The residents are all haggard and miserable. News of deaths among neighbors is now an indispensable part of the daily news. If you come back now, you will definitely suspect that this is no longer the former hometown: the beautiful scenery of Jian Lake, the calm Lake Hu, have become a gathering place for tears of hunger; the Orchid Pavilion at the foot of Mount Kuaiji is no longer the solemn and gorgeous scenic spot it once was. Their surroundings seem to be covered with a layer of dark clouds of sorrow. I never thought that this former garden where King Yue endured hardship to achieve his goal would turn into a hell on earth. Recently, I heard that enthusiastic gentlemen in the Shen area are running around to solicit donations for their hometown. The compatriots here are extremely excited, and the pitiful scene of them eagerly awaiting is truly heartbreaking. I hope that the Yue people in Shanghai will quickly rise up to provide emergency relief.</p>

<h3>The Trend of Future Movies - Color Films Prevail, Black and White Films Eliminated</h3>
<p>— Xinfang</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the increasing production of color films, we can know that in the future history of film, black and white films will be eliminated again, which is undoubtedly true. The larger film companies in Hollywood are all concentrating their full strength on producing various color films. No matter whether those films have ordinary content or a structure that is not compact, smart film merchants have unanimously recognized that if they are rendered with color, they are more likely to cater to the psychology of the audience than if only black and white images are shown on the screen.</p>
<p>At the beginning, when the film industry progressed from the silent era to the sound era, of course, a group of people were unearthed, but another group of people disappeared from the screen as a result. In the future, when the position of black and white films is replaced by color films, the same encounter will definitely occur. Now, the general stars in Hollywood are already feeling fear because of this issue; they or she are all worried about whether their position has been shaken by this trend?</p>
<p>In fact, the situation mentioned above has already been heard in Hollywood. Everyone has admitted that the relationship between shooting color films and the skin of the actors is extremely large; in addition, there is another argument that actors with brown skin are more suitable for shooting color films than those with white skin. Paramount Pictures plans to shoot a total of five color films this year, four of which will be starred by actors with brown skin, and the other one is "Northwest Mounted Police" directed by Cecil B. DeMille, the protagonist of which is Madeleine Carroll, who is a white-skinned star.</p>
<p>The period when color films occupy the entire film industry is not far from today. Therefore, public opinion in all walks of life is also predicting that there will be a major change in the film industry soon, so let us wait and see. Finally, let me talk a few words about the film washing work. It is said that black films use a brownish-yellow liquid and powder; the amount used is extremely large, but it will never cause damage to the film itself; color films use another kind of gray powder, and can only use a small amount.</p>
<h3>Zhang Yipeng Improves Peking Opera</h3>
<p>— Shen Qi</p>
<p>Zhang Yipeng, a young Peking Opera practitioner, has undergone a sudden change in his thinking since leaving the Grand Theater. He feels that in this great era, drama is not a simple form of entertainment, but should bear the cultural mission of its own. Therefore, he performs very solemnly with trepidation. In this year, he and his second younger brother, Erpeng, in addition to hiring Mr. Cheng Xiaoqing to teach Chinese studies to make up for his insufficient knowledge, have also worked hard on the Peking Opera improvement movement. For example, writing scripts is one of them. Currently, the play "Wen Tianxiang" has been completed, and he continues to collect information on "Lin Chong." According to him, in this transitional period, art should be given equal importance with ideology, because ideology can educate the audience, and art can strive for the audience's appreciation of the fun.</p>
<p>However, what he believes is the problem is whether the theater owner can accept his proposition? Therefore, he is temporarily retiring to his hometown, waiting for a place where he can manipulate everything backstage.</p>
<p>Recently, the Carlton is preparing to start its summer vacation from the 8th of next month, because the Yifeng Society is currently in the Carlton, and the front and back stages are indeed a unified plan. This is exactly in line with his ideal, so he wants to take advantage of their summer vacation period to prepare to rent it and perform his new Peking Opera play to test whether the audience can accept it. However, if the Carlton only takes a month's summer vacation, then he can only give up, because in any case, performing in this hot summer is bound to fail, and it should be at least after June to be able to perform.</p>
<h3>Brief News from the Art World</h3>
<p>(1) "Qingdao Drama Club" is a newly emerging drama club, which decided to hold its first public performance on the 30th. The location is the Ningbo Fellow Association, and the play "Phantom of the Opera" will be performed for two shows, day and night.

(4) The Sichuan Road YMCA and the Jing'an Temple Road YWCA have specially set up summer harmonica classes, and hired harmonica player Shi Renwang to guide.

<h3>Sons and Daughters of China Repeatedly Inspected in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>The "Sons and Daughters of China" produced by the Central Film Studio contains four stories, writing about the various young men and women after the Anti-Japanese War, which is quite profound. It has been transported to the Soviet Union for screening and has won international honors. This film was shipped to Hong Kong last year. During the initial inspection by the Hong Kong government, it was considered that the last paragraph was too stimulating. As a result, it was completely cut off. Recently, a trailer was published, planning to be released to the public. Unexpectedly, the Hong Kong government ordered a re-inspection, and it is said that several places still need to be deleted. Therefore, the trailer on the newspaper has been suspended, and the screening period will be postponed again.</p>
<h3>Shouyun Huzhai Quhua Answers Questions on the Romance of the West Chamber Slang</h3>
<p>— Lin Shaoqing</p>
<p>A few days ago, I talked about Qiu Hu teasing his wife in this publication, in which I explained the words in the song of Qiu Hu teasing his wife in the Yuan Dynasty, which aroused Mr. Dong's letter asking about the sentences in the Romance of the West Chamber. Mr. Dong had some points that he did not understand, and ordered me to explain them clearly. I am not smart, I only know a little about the words in Yuan songs, so I only list them according to the letter and answer them casually. I don't know if it is appropriate. 1. "Drawing a bow to entice fate" fate is the character for fate, this sentence comes from Jin Shengtan's general comments before the "Surprising Beauty" fold, which is Shengtan's learning to write Yuan people's language. "Drawing a bow" refers to Zhang Sheng. Nowadays, people say that the character Zhang is "bow long," and even today, the secret language of the northern Jianghu people calls those whose surname is Zhang "curved bow child." Its origin comes from the Yuan people's language "drawing a bow," which can be proven. Shengtan commented, "Drawing a bow to entice fate," saying that this other courtyard must be attached to the temple, so that Zhang Sheng can cleverly entice fate, because he can see Yingying by traveling to the temple. Because of this sentence, I had to look at the entire text of Jin's comments again before I found this sentence, which was a pain. 2. "Drawing a bow" sour old man, in the song of Hongniang in "In Front of the Hou," Mr. Dong dropped the word "old man." The two words "drawing a bow" are already clear, so now I will explain the two words "sour old man." The Yuan people called small children "old man child," and poor scholars were often called "sour Ding." "Sour Ding" is a general term for scholars who are either strong or old, and "sour old man" refers to young people. "Drawing a bow sour old man" can be explained in today's language as a poor sour kid from the Zhang family. 3. "Hawk-eyed old man" old man means eye, and today's northern Jianghu secret language calls eye "Zhaoer," which means the same; hawk-eyed is an adjective, describing eyes that are big and bright, and the eyes are double eyelids and beautiful, which is called hawk-eyed. Northerners still use these two words to praise women's beautiful eyes, but hawk's original sound is Hu, and today's northerners read it as tiger, which is slightly different. 4. "Sage fights," "fight" is the "fight up the oriole" fight. Liu Baoquan sang the drum war Changsha or the saber meeting, calling Guan Zhuangmiao the Sage Grandpa, and this sage is the same. The Yuan people called all immortals sages, not only Guan Gong, "Good teaching sage fights, Zhang Sheng hates the sun's late fall, should teach immortals like Hou Yi and the like, fight him down also; the word fight is to match the rhyme, the word sage is occasionally connected." 5. "The gauze window also has no Hongniang report," this sentence is easy to understand. I remember that Hongniang is Wuming, this is a pun, Wuming is exactly the same as a person's name, so it is used, borrowing what poem allusions, please Mr. Dong use his brain and check it out. Yuan songs are the mother of all operas, and many of the words in them are different from modern ones. I especially like to study them. Anyone who likes songs can put in some effort, and may be able to find many interesting things, such as archaeologists going to ancient Egyptian tombs and discovering the beautiful corpse of the "mummy," isn't it fun!</p>
