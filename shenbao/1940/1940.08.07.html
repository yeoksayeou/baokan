<h3>所謂四國經濟集團的檢討</h3>
<p>近三五日，義大利方面一再散播一宗如火荼的空氣，略謂世界四大全能國家——義國，德國，日本，蘇聯，將在經濟上形成偉大的集團，與英國相抗衡，制英國於死命。假使這眞是正在醞釀之中而可能實現的事實，則所影響於英國死活者，究竟如何，姑且存而不論，然四國這樣聯繫了起來，確乎不失其爲夠動世界視聽的傑構。</p>
<p>傑構不可多覯。一種理想中異常痛快的傑構，每每有其先天後天的魔障，使以先覩爲快的人們終於失望，德儀兩國早已駢肩作戰，誼同一體；四居其二，算學上顯見傑構旣有半數成就，僅僅缺一半了。何况德國與蘇聯自去年八月起，締結了協定，平分了波蘭；而蘇聯　波羅的海方面的兼併，在東南歐洲方面的擴展，得以事實上證實了德蘇的默契；最近蘇聯外長莫洛托夫的報告，復由道義上說明了德蘇的融洽。至於義蘇之間，東南歐洲方面旣沒有什麼問題，又據說感情已很和諧了，貿易即將調整了。由此說來，雖德義蘇三國結成經濟集團的朕兆猶爲局外人所無從體認，然而祇要蘇聯亦有與德義相密切結交至成爲一個經濟集團的意思，則三角戀愛是準可以成功的。蘇聯意思不可知，確是自始迄今從未聲明過沒有這意思。假定蘇聯今後有此意思吧，四居其三，所缺也就不多，但看日本。日本在目前的處境之下，『鳥鳴嚶嚶，求其友聲』，倒也是異常盼切。誰阿附他的意願、誰贊成他的行徑，誰便是他所感荷的友邦。他與德義兩國原有反共協定之雅，雖曰時過境遷，茲已偃旗息鼓；允在四國經濟集團的理想角色中包合着蘇聯，更談不得反共交情；然而歷史檔案中有此一樁尙未註銷的公案，則他與德義當然比衆不同。其間，義大利對於日本，眞是具有誠摯的熱情。至於德國對於日本，爲了對付英國，在某種條件之下，亦自『有厚望焉』。不妨　作一個假定，假定德日今後兩相遷就，而所期待着的條件竟然契合了吧，則所謂四國集團的傑構，在算學上祗差百分數很小的一個餘數，亦即祗殘餘了蘇　兩國的問題了。即此殘餘，請加檢討。</p>
<p>本月一日，蘇聯的蘇聯院與民族院舉行聯席會議的席上，莫洛托夫氏以人民委員會委員長兼人民外交委員會委員長的崇高職位，報告外交政策。他整個報告是明快的，惟獨關於日本的一段，却吞吐其辭，保留了最大角度的盤旋。他說：『就大言，日力似有改善關係的傾向：苟雙方均能認識去除障碍的必要，則蘇日改進關係，並非不可能。雖然，日本新政府所謂「新政治機構」計畫，不甚明瞭。日政府南進口號，已引起日本主要方面的注意；因該方面對於歐洲之變動，極感興趣也。雖然，在許多方面，彼等的政治抱負尙未明瞭：關於蘇日關係，亦有同樣情形』。論及蘇日關係，誰必立即直覺的聯想及於中國。因此，請連帶一言：在莫氏報告中，關於中國的一段，保持了明快的作風；他說：『吾人與偉大中國的關係，自兩國簽訂不侵犯公的後，一切素極友好，中國現正爲生存而戰』；寥寥數語，所表示的蘇聯對華意態，比較了他所稱述的對日意態，可見蘇日關係縱有改進可能，決不影響及於蘇聯對於正在爲生存而戰中之偉大中國的友好關係。再者，蘇日交惡，由近年的日本侵華而蘇聯援華，更爲明顯：但交惡不是近年的而是歷史的、不是爲了中國而（一）是爲了日本的北進政策，（二）是爲了日本儼然自居爲反共十字軍的東方急先鋒。蘇聯方面關於日本所業已偃旗息鼓的反共陣營，圭少自去年八月以來，久已不予掛齒。關於日本數十年來經之營之的北進政策，所由形成蘇日歷史的交惡，却由這一次莫氏的報告，指出了日本今後或將轉變政策而改趨南進，很巧妙地反襯了這是蘇日或得改善關係的原因。同時，莫氏亦很巧妙地表示並不信任日本主要方面的政治抱負、確有轉向南進而放棄北進的決心與決行。在不信任的表示之下，試問蘇日改善關係的可能性究有幾何？兩國經濟提携的可能性究有幾何？所謂四國結爲經濟集團的可能性究有幾何？</p>
<p>更進一步言之：日本不放　其對華侵略，則縱使發動南進，亦即不能視爲放棄北進，不能使蘇聯認爲業已無虞於日本北進的威脅而與之改善關係。縱使日本幡然改圖，忠實的放棄了北進而南進了，蘇日關係改善了，但謂蘇聯因此并願放棄其中立政策，竟願犧牲經濟上多方面發展的一切可能機會，竟甘接受束縛而加入德義日三國乃至任何其他若干國的經濟集團，揆之蘇聯國策，亦是根本不能想像的現象。所謂四國集團，祗是空中樓閣吧！</p>

<h3>歐戰實錄　（三）　英空軍戰士自述</h3>
<p>英法聯軍自法國鄧扣克港撤退，得力於英軍戰鬥機以寡敵衆，控制該港及英吉利海峽上空者，實非淺鮮。下文爲英國戰鬥機隊某隊長之作戰經歷談。原文亦載美國Life畫報，譯錄於後：</p>
<p>我機一隊，計噴火式戰鬥機十二架，於英法聯軍自鄧扣克撤退第一日淸晨，整裝以待，上午九時，奉令出發，振翼升至二萬呎高空，飛渡北海。機羣緊密，無綫電停止通報。向前遠眺，海岸綫極爲熟悉。數分鐘後，便見加萊一帶村鎭起火焚燒，濃烟滾滾，地平綫爲一片烟霧所　罩。機羣在該城上空，疾駛而過，卽在長五十哩之天空從事巡邏，未見敵機踪影，逐決計下降，低飛至四千呎上空盤旋，忽見一萬五千呎高空有德機羣約六十架，計轟炸機二十架，戰鬥機四十架，乃悔我機隊低飛之失策。俄頃之間，德戰鬥機羣，其中多屬梅塞斯密特式，已呼嘯而下，向我機隊擈來，我機亦卽分頭迎搫。</p>
<p>約在一萬呎高空，我機迫至梅塞斯密特式一一〇機一架身後，乃尾追不捨。翻騰追逐，機頭螺旋頁疾轉如風駛搫。未幾，德機疾降而下，我仍緊迫其後，欲使德機準對我視綫中心，實非易事。一俟瞄準，便按電鈕，我機所裝白朗寗式機關槍八挺，乃同時開火，每分鐘各發彈一千二百顆，齊向德機射去。楊慶槍後散出火藥味，直撲鼻孔。槍彈擊中德機時，火花　裂。瞥見德機駕駛員頭顱後部輪廊，掉首回顧，旋轉將半，便停止不動，想已中彈。一刹那間，該德機卽起火，　烟直冒，滾轉墜下矣</p>
<p>至是，余乃向四週瞭望，以俾追擊他機，並發覺已飛入內地的五十哩。四顧未見他機，乃轉身飛返海岸，忽見我機存油，僅敷直飛返防之用，未免大驚，蓋中途若遇敵機，不知何以應付也。第一次交戰，似覺精神百倍，事後追思，又感不寒而慄。返防途次，卽在北海上空，發無綫電逐一詢問其他各機駕駛員戰果。首先電覆者，懽然報吿擊落敵機一架，各擊落一二架不等，惟兩機寂然無聲，想巳殉職矣。</p>
<p>返防後，我機隊灌油裝彈，一刻鐘後又升空出發，剛飛抵鄧扣克一萬呎高空，忽有大隊梅塞斯密特式德機，竄出雲層，向下猛撲，幾使我機隊措手不及。此項敵機顯係翱翔高空掩護下面雲層中之轟炸機。移時，耳旁槍彈橫飛，並聞後一面有德機一架槍聲軋軋。未幾，該機突然下降，我亦疾降追搫，但在雲　中，該機竟踪跡杳然。</p>
<p>我機旋又升高，見餘機的在六千呎上空，正與戰鬥機多架混戰，敵機中有蓉克斯式八八號機數架。余乃衝入參戰，並開無綫電收聽，偶聞我機隊各隊員交談，雜以掃射德機槍聲。某機紐西蘭駕駛員泰然告另一機駕駛員曰：「君後有梅塞斯密特式敵機一架」。對方答曰：「OKay，老友」。</p>
<p>余乃認定容克斯式八八號機一架進攻。該機尾部機關槍手立卽向余掃射。槍彈掠過機窗，淸楚可數。余亦瞄準目標，開槍射掃，軋軋連聲，機身微顫，德機巳成兩截，接着便於烟火團中向下直墜。我仍盤旋徐降，見該機機員一名躍出，張傘飄蕩而下。</p>
<p>時空中已無敵機，余乃轉身重返根據地。歸途中電呼餘機，藉悉各機全數無恙。德機被擊落者共十一架，連先前一戰，共擊落十九架，第一日勝利巳屬於我。</p>
<p>第二日，我機隊仍出發巡邏，並派兩機單獨偵察。一在鄧扣克上空一萬二千呎雲層隱匿一在二千呎上空盤旋。餘機則向加萊飛去。的至半途，雲層上空一機卽以無綫電通知下面一機曰，「注意」大批梅塞·斯密特式敵機彌天而來！」下面一機卽謂曰，“OKay”別讓他們脫身，我來矣」。</p>
<p>我機隊得訊，卽轉身飛入北海上空，見容克斯式德機數一架，由梅塞斯密特式機掩護，正向魚雷艇一艘及滿　士兵之救生船數艘　彈轟炸。魚雷艇高射砲還擊甚烈。我機隊出其不意，突然衝下。各擊落敵機一架。我機隊乃相率上升，再度整隊衝下，時敵機已分散。其中梅塞斯密特式機一架向東竄逸，余卽向之猛撲，槍聲響處，該機噴出黑烟，已如落葉下墜。余卽隨之飛下，見其墜地，欣喜莫名。</p>
<p>時鄧扣克上空兩機與德機羣戰况如何，尙不可知。旋接一機覆電，謂已擊落敵機四架。未幾，該機駕駛員突然失聲曰：「我機已中彈着火。」一二秒鐘後，該駕駛員又曰：「下面有驅逐艦一艘，我準備躍出。」一秒鐘後，他又喃喃自語「怎麼辦。」</p>
<p>從噴火式戰鬥機躍出，確非易事。最好莫如倒轉機身，使背部向下，然後穿出。旋悉、該駕駛員確用此法躍出機身。三日後，彼身穿海軍少尉制服，水兵褲，肩荷水兵背囊，狼狽歸隊來矣。</p>
<p>是日戰况雖烈，成績却不佳，擊落德機，僅十一架而巳。</p>
<p>第三日，聯軍大舉撤退，德機亦全部出動，阻撓撤退。破曉，我機隊卽出戰。早餐前巳兩度往返鄧扣克。交戰不下三十次。第二次所遇敵方戰鬥機之多，實爲前所未見，全屬梅塞斯密特式一〇九號機，約百架。但我機隊迎搫甚為得手。在一千呎以至一萬五千呎高空，上下衝殺。衝下追搫後，扳操縱桿上升時，知覺糢糊，但確知曾搫毀德機四架。我機隊其餘各機戰果亦不惡。</p>
<p>我機隊作戰半小時，如火如茶，衹　失一架。該機一翼被搫毀，駕駛員降落鄧扣克海灘，額部受傷，但仍設法用無綫電報告司令部，謂已「安然着地，」當夜隨同英軍一隊返國。</p>
<p>惡戰告終，我機隊又與梅塞斯密特式一一〇號機羣交綏，擊落其三架。此類德機下降確極迅速。是日午後，余從一萬五千呎高空，以每小時五百五十哩之速率向下直衝，追擊一機。該德機疾駛而下，想必已墜地。</p>
<p>余當時以機尾調整機爲助，竭力扳回操縱桿高升，頓時又感知覺糢糊，第見日光忽變黃色，又變紅色，漸成一片昏黑，雖未失去知覺，但已目不能視耳不可聽，惟覺較普通馬達聲更響之嗡嗡聲，震耳欲聾耳。</p>
<p>我機隊在鄧扣克上空血戰，得益非淺。由余視之，德機駕駛員，多屬平凡，且戰鬥精神與技術，亦不高明。雖以數量勝人，但在質的方面，不逮英機遠甚。</p>

<h3>金融述評　（續）　（五）　（日）</h3>
<p>— 聖凱</p>
<p>因爲辦法中規定，出進口商應按法價與中交掛牌價享受匯價差與繳納平衡費，個人曾在二十八年七月五日爲文論及商用匯率可以大小。但中交兩銀行的掛牌價自掛英匯七便士，美匯十三元六二五，港匯二元一四五之後，因爲種種原因，卽釘住在這一個水準，直到今年七月底，未曾變動過。當二十八年七月所規定的七便士，與黑市匯價是非常接近的，二十八年六月黑市是六便士又八分之七，並且低於黑市，二十八年一——六月的平均數七便士又十六分之十三，所以七便士是非常適當的。今年以來黑市匯價由緊軟而至五月二日大縮，自五月十日回長以後，直至七月底英金在四便士以內盤旋，美金在六元上下波動，與去年所定之商用匯率相差過多。以二十九年上半期英匯平均四·一六一五便士計；其間相差達百分之六十八。至於美匯平均是六·三九九五元，與十三八月三日止</p>
<p>元六二五相差達百分之一百十三；這是因爲套算而定的十三元六二五，乃根據英鎊四元六角八分的行市，其後紐約市塲自由金鎊產生，而上海匯市則跟美金而走，故差額特大。由此論之，商用匯率實在老早就應該改定。這一次新定四便士半；實在不足驚奇，何况商用滙率本來是可以大小的　同時依照現在中國政府所施行的有效的外滙和貿易的統制辦法看來，中央銀行仍是維持法定滙價，進口商仍要繳納平衡費，出口商仍得享受匯價差。</p>
<p>商用匯率改爲英金四便士半後，美港兩匯當然隨之變動。不過所謂英鎊的市塲滙率，是指紐約市塲的自由鎊價呢，還是倫敦的法定鎊價？若依法定鎊價四·〇二計算，則美滙將定爲七元五三七五，而每天不變動，若依自由鎊價計算，則每天將有變動，如以紐約市價英鎊七月三十一日三元八角三分牛的收盤價計算，則美匯應爲七元一九〇六二五。至於港滙依對英一先令三便士又三十二分之一計算，應爲一港元等於三元三角四分。故此今後的商用滙率雖較黑市爲高，但是非常接近，依此節中所述匯價與二十九年上半年平均數較，差額的自百分之七至百分之十三而已。</p>
<p>此外商用滙率變更的最大理由；在於努力收集外匯基金，獎勵土貨外銷。因爲過去法幣黑市滙率遠低於商用匯率，商人運貨結匯出口無利可圖，且要遭受損失，故大多數停止營業，或者囤集居奇暫不出口，狡滑的奸商，更走私到漢口出口，結果影響生產，致使出口貿易不能進展，國家外匯收入减少。中國的最高統帥近曾宣稱，在抗戰的第四年中，軍事上的努力不過佔百分之三十，而經濟上的努力，却應佔百分之七十，可見經濟作戰的重要，而努力收集外匯基金，獎勵土貨外銷，却是經濟作戰的主要利器。所以不得不變更商用匯率，以期達到經濟作戰的目標。、完）</p>
<h3>紗花　紗市盤旋　在千元關外</h3>
<p>紗市平定、趨勢又帶盤旋之局面、此因客幫實銷米見大量的發展、同時外滙又見站定、所以人心安靜、漲風又吿平息、不過脚地甚穩、如無意外之變化、仍大盤檔上進出根本問題、還係交通運輸綫阻碍也、故在千元關外、又止漲而盤旋矣、</p>
<p>現紗晨開人氣　緊、但不及上日午後培盤之緊俏、因外滙不縮、反見放　、所以買戶不湧、二十支雙馬價爲一千零二十元、少頃搶隔夜帽子之輩、鑒於環境不良、紛紛傾吐、挫跌至一千零十二元、旋後某公司拖進、又復回升至千〇十九元、收盤稍疲、查半日間成交統計二千一百四十包、行情　十支雙馬漲九元、查棉紗今日有三百三十件、另有棉布一百零五件、運往厦鬥、運往香港則有棉布一百三十件、棉紗一百八十五件、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、同行一、四六〇香港三二〇</p>

<h3>棉銷難期振作</h3>
<p>本棉情形、又人平坦之途、此因外棉回鬆、海外棉市滯鈍、國內紗銷不暢紗價又不見得十分向升、所以人心復疲軟、火機花在一百五十一元、印棉　洛去一百元、成交幾百件、廠家納胃未能大旺云、</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約棉市市况頗形呆滯、各方俱抱　觀態度、結果收盤價格、較之上日跌落一二磅昔、印度昨日連同預測漲跌俱見、上下互有一羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日稍呈活躍之狀、但祇於日方廠商華廠則仍靜寂異常、昨日同業之售與日廠者、爲數的千餘包、但俱放銀期的一月、按照目前形勢、外棉交易又將鬆動矣、蓋因各方盛傳、日輪巳停止搭載英客、及運輸印棉之故也、</p>

<p>昨日洋米仍爲先緊後疲之局、晨間初開、浮囤散戶、大舉搜羅、本鄉店胃等一般實銷、遂亦不辨皂白、繼之暢辦、於是賣方喊聲遂起、行情節節上升、復迄前日之高峯、但價格一經提足、心思家又施其擒縱之故技、大都乘高出籠霎卽市貨充斥、驚得本鄉作客縮手不進、至此銷塲漸衰、市色還疲價遂回落、迨收盤已較前市收價反短半元左右、若一號陳西貢祇五十八元半、二號五十三元半、惟國際形勢旣稍緩和、外滙亦見放長、投機份子卽無由施其操縱故技、獲利散多復求急脫、行囤貨主亦不願久持、市乃節節向下、二號暹米初小半元爲六十三元、旋自六十二元六角降至六十二元、二號西貢開價卽小至六十二元、均比前日小去一元半、西貢混合碎在貨方急脫與進戶觀望下、跌開五十上元半、則比前日五十三元半較小有二元、而成交數共計不足二百噸、現米亦祇二千五六百包、</p>
<p>粳　國米、昨無到貨、明暗盤交易、隨　米起伏不定、結果仍屬平平、與前盤相仿、無所榮辱、常幫鮮淸粳六十八九元、錫淸粳六十七元二角、六十七元、常州蘇崑粳六十五六元、次至宿六十二三元、宿薄稻六十二三元、南港鮮特早稻六十五、斛見六十一元左右、金溧特元六十一二元、常丹白元六十元上下、香港白元六埂一二元、</p>

<h3>粉價參差</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日粉市情形、稍有參差、查本廠粉站定十五元原盤、並無變化、而廠批出數量、仍有五六千包、均由木街鄕帮辦去、惟近日內地粉如金山雙獅等牌、相繼運滬、價祗十四元二三角、所以日廠粉鳳凰牌價亦軋鬆、昨開本月份係十四元二角、九月份十四元五角半至四角半、比前回小二三角、聞回籠貨尙在貶價遷就中、至於洋粉則售價反見昂挺、因有客帮之問津、如洋砲台雙鷹牌等、前開十五元六七角、昨日喊價　十六元、故市面參差不一、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日麥市尙鮮變　、蓋以連日到貨不多、行客存麥一致扳持、而日廠進胃、並不貪取、華廠更難暢收、致市面續告清淡、聞日廠進價為二十元左右、華廠收價須加一元半至二元、統市直接解廠者、併計不過三千包左右云、今日有麥子一百包運往厦門、</p>

<p>豆油　昨日油市悉守原盤、大局雖被產地有德商（昨誤刊法商）採辦而市昂、因之影響申市、但滬存尙能應付現銷、故脚地依然堅硬、不過賣買形少　奮、統共成交膠州生油二百五十件、價詳市價欄、烟台生油五十件、又聽裝二百聽、江北本坊聽生油一千五百聽、膠州豆油二百五十件、靑歧豆油五十件、大連豆油一百四十桶、大有廠油一百担、去路除江北生油　香港幫辦去、　連豆　爲內　採取外、餘均爲行　本街之胃、又生油今日有一千二百聽運往香港、又七百六十聽、運往厦門、</p>
<p>豆餅　成交數雖未多、但大都是內地實際銷塲、故在供應轉稀之潛勢下、其漲風突盛、結果較前市漲起四五角不等、計開甡記餅一千六七百片、價自十一元四角至七角、靑中餅二百片、價爲十元零八角、元隆餅二車、價爲十一元一二角、查豆餅今日有六千四百片、運往厦門、</p>

<h3>南北貨　川榨菜漲十元　　川榨菜因來源無繼、市存且缺、價爲之步緊、前後又升十元之多、昨市售至二百元、實爲僅見之新高價也、昨日有杏仁三十包、由天津運來、烟台來花生二百包、雜項　烟皂行市平定　　香烟客銷頗暢、有應接不暇之勢、後因必須憑單出　，銷路遂淡、惟有華成公司出品美麗金鼠兩脾、銷路仍廣、近來稅局停給運照、去路稍受影響、昨開大英牌一千零七十三元、老刀品海兩牌迫近行盤、五華牌爲五百十三元、因廠方有貨開出、行情趨軟、較上週回小八十餘元、　　肥皂囤戶交易大旺、漲風甚熾之後、市上存貨充　　　戶急欲脫手，昨市固本皂新　二十一元五角、老貨二十　零八角、白祥茂二十元零六角黃祥茂十六元二角、交易均寥寥、　銷不　、（坤）</h3>

<p>南昌大儺　　詩有以社以方之什，卽今之春祈秋報村社演截賽會之事也。周禮方相氏掌逐疫，卽今之大儺，所謂黃金四目，執戈揚盾，與今之跳　王捉鬼之意，無以異也。夫逐疫驅鬼等事，其迹近乎兒戲，然鬼神之爲道，雖非聖賢所常言，然觀於論語所紀，鄕人儺，朝服而立於阼階，可見大聖如孔子，亦不以此事爲非；蓋大儺之禮，原係减除不祥之意，南省有三節祀孤之典，迎神於郊，以祀厲鬼，祀典昭昭，禮至重也。南昌之大儺，雖未知其禮若何，大抵與古時逐疫驅　　　報新抄　六十七年前　（四六八）　　（見遜情同治十二年本報）　　鬼之義相同，但爲首之入，類以游手好閒之人爲之，挨戶歛錢，聚衆兹事，歲以爲常。本年盛飾儀仗，大排執事，輿神像以出，至晚仍與以歸，地方官亦隨其後焉。士女競觀，舉國若在，人多地狹之處，往往有擁擠肇釁之事，脫簪墜珥，所在多有，挖包剪綹，雜乎其中。有地方官同行，尚且貽患若此，故鄕村賽會迎神之舉，每釀事端，其亦宜矣。大禮之留遺，適爲斯氏民之大累，此誠鄕曲之頹風也。　　明白刋登　　浦濱訛言　　掘獲古器</p>

<p>春秋鬼月  蕭吾　　中秋月餅已經上市了，那些穿香雲紗短衫褲的「小弟兄」們自然也不會忘了這裏有個油水的機會。七月啊！這是鬼月。靠鬼吃飯，多的是！　　於是劃淸了地段，規定了里弄，三五成羣，油扇輕搖，捐簿前導，挨門踏戶去說好話了。　　首先是一年一度老規矩，老闆先生幫幫忙。大家知道這也是逃不了的一節規」，不過祗幫忙是不願意的，上海人打話化錢要化在刀口上，立即拿出錢來是「蘇桃子」。「小弟兄」們見開塲白不生效力，當然幫忙之外，另做文章：打打醮，消災降福，保佑合宅平安！這扌有意思。或許家裏剛有病人，這也是少不了的「冲喜」。　　但是「買福」的價錢是不一定的，照這門口往年大概是四角，哼！今年米要賣七十塊錢一祖，和尙道士，錫箔紙錢，那一樣不漲價，拿出一塊錢來，「小弟兄」們的臉色不見得好看，一個說：「高升點！」一個就攤開捐簿上寫上兩元大宇，「幫幫忙罷！」那就沒有討價還價的餘地，合宅太平當然也不在乎一塊錢上。　　「謝謝！謝謝！」　　「福星」降臨到隔壁人家了。　　於是弄堂裏的紙衣紙褲掛起來，和尙道士也擇吉登塲，放一堂燄口。再於是，一紙黃榜，「小弟兄」們上酒店吃猪頭肉去了。　　外幫人看了好像一齣戲，上海人却巳見怪不怪了。　　廢除迷信，眞是談何容易，平時香燭不上門，黃榜上的台銜却是逃不掉的。在這種特殊狀態之下，和尙道士果然頓此生存，「小弟兄」們的生活也悠然自得了！　　要廢除迷信，還有待於多方面的努力！貪病者的福音　益友社主辦「健康檢查」  同病　　——各界均可免費受檢——　　　　記得在二年多以前，隨着上海局勢的日趨惡化，一般的靑年普遍地感覺到了消極和苦悶，因此以提倡正當娛樂，互研學術知能爲號召的工商界的業餘組織，有如雨後春筍般廣泛地展開，益友社便也是活躍的一個。二年多來確實會爲一般的工商界靑年做過了相當多的事業，對於他們業餘的消遣和精神食糧方面，允著有了相當的功績。　　但孤島是在激盪的暴風雨中，每一時都在醞釀着她的可能的變動。自去年六月以來，隨着黑市外滙的簸動。孤市的物價，給掀起了個罕見的高潮，這「生活難的暗影，顯然地已爬上了孤島上每個平民的胸頭，貧困和飢餓，已造成了今天孤市的普遍的苦難。　　工商界的從業昌們在道個飛漲的物價潮中，遭到了更大的生活的苦惱，是不可吾認的。因此如果在這個時候有人還在做着正當娛樂的提倡工作，確不免有不切實際之感；所以在近一年來益友社的工作重心，由多數娛樂的部門，而轉向社友福利事業方面的開展，切實幫助社友們的苦難的生活。如在去年底和木年春來舉辦洋米平糶，和煤球平賣之類，確實獲致了最大多數的社友們的擁戴和贊美！　　這裏我覺得尤其値得提出的，是該社的福利事業不僅是以服務於二千餘的社友問爲職責，而且有好些原是普及社會性的。像在不久前，正當正當夏初的時節，該社舉行了一個防疫運動，除了在社友間普遍實行米騙子  露佩　　里弄裏有人來上鬥兜賣食米，鄰居的老婆婆看了米樣子，又問悉了比較市價便宜得七八元的價目，決定要買三擔。那人裝作很誠懇地婉謝說：「至多兩擔，因爲這米是我鄕間直接運滬，數量不多，還須應酬幾家老顧主。……準定二擔，明天送來，貨到付款，請你預備着錢。到第二天，那人果然送來二擔頭號白米，由一個老司務模樣的裝束，陪同送來。老婆婆的女傭人，引導着老司務背米進房，倒入米箱。那賣米的人就向老婆婆說。「米來了，請你就把錢給我，我還要送米到別地方去。很忙！不能躭擱！」老婆婆當卽照付。那人收了錢，很忽急地走了。老司務一袋一袋的把米背進房裏，一袋一袋的倒進了米箱，揩揩面上的汗珠，就向老婆婆要米錢，每擔六十元，二擔一百二十元。老婆婆驚異地說：「米錢已付給你們先生了。」老司務他發急的說；「那個是我們先生？不是你家的人？他到我們店裏叫米，的定米錢到家裏拿，貨到付款，開什麼玩笑！」事情是雙方都受了騙。免費注射防疫針外，有好些的店和公司，曾函請他們爲職工們舉行集體注射，該社的衛生股股員，不但是精神熱誠，而且工作周到，給予社會的印象，可謂良好和深刻！　　最近隨着該社第四屆微求運動的進行，福利事業似乎更有了顯著的發展。據筆者所知，於上月十五日起，該社除自設理髮室，以低廉的取費（每次二角半）爲社友解除理髮店漲價的苦惱之外，允具有廣大的意義的，是關於「益友診所」的開幕了。　　這裏且節錄益友診所開幕宣言中的一段，用作瞭解該診所抱負的一斑：　　『上海爲國際都市，人烟稠密，空氣汚濁，而房價奇昂，生活艱難！因此一般市民，尤其我工商從業員輩，平時更因收入有限，終日碌碌，居處狹陋，飲食粗糲，對於衛生之道，以及體格健康，往往無法顧及，卽旦疾病罹身，又輙爲經濟所限，不能及早治療，以致延誤不救，慘遭傷亡者，比比皆是，言念及此，不勝悲嘆！……本社有鑒於此，故於發揚社旨於「提倡正當娛樂」，「改善業餘生活」之外，近更努力舉辦各項福利事業，適應大衆需要。茲者本社診所，業吿籌備完竣，於本月十五日開幕，所有本社所聘得之著名醫師，及醫藥用品，X光等，均願竭誠爲全體社友及社會工商各界人士服務！……』　　根據這麼一個樂善的抱負，該診所新近就發起了「全身健康檢查」運動，不但該社全體社友都有免費受檢約權利，而且各界需要檢查的，也可報各免費檢查，但需照X光者，得酌付電費，社友五角，非社友一元，這較諸醫院中的代價，也是微乎其微了。上海「幽默」　　甲：那裏去啊？　　乙：出去。　　甲：哈地方？　　乙：外面。　　甲：喔！　　乙：再會。　　（知靑）林則徐販土  兩渾　　鴉片之戰林則徐以焚土著稱，故今人談及禁烟者，鮮有不道及林則徐其人也。不料昨日本埠報載，林則徐身藏烟土，被戈登路捕房拘獲云云。戲作打油詩一首，以實本刊。　　禁烟抗戰定不虛，　　靑史留傳林則徐，　　底事於今潦倒甚，　　販烟竟到捕房居。　　鴉烟流毒果何如，　　亡國破家洵有餘，　　世上薰蕕太差別，　　今來古往兩則徐。霍桑探案舞后的歸宿  程小青　　　　第四章　幾種推想　　　　霍桑的眼睛裏父閃出一種光彩，分明他也已按不住他心裏的驚喜。至於我的情緒怎樣，自然更不必說。　　他繼續問道：「這女朋友可漂亮？」　　那茶房扮了一扮鬼臉。「漂亮得很！身材很長，臉兒圓胖胖的，戴着一副黑眼鏡。伊的裝飾也挺摩登。我想想看，伊第一次穿的是——」　　霍桑點點頭，忙截住他說：「好，你用不着細說。伊在這裏住過幾夜？」　　那茶房想了一想，答道：「兩夜。我想第一夜大概是十號罷？第二夜是大前天，禮拜五，十六。」　　霍桑又點點頭，分明他已確定這女朋友是王麗蘭無疑。「你的記心眞不錯。這姓錢的客人已在這裏住了幾天？」　　那茶房受了霍桑的稱贊，似乎更起勁了。「好久了，快近一個月。」「你剛扌說有好幾件事使你覺得奇怪。還有什麼？」　　「他的朋友談話時聲音總是很低，有時候我們　去沖茶，他們的談話便會立刻停止。」「你說的是女朋友嗎？」　　「不，男朋友。那女朋友一來，那就顧忌得更厲害啦，連房門都得鎖上！我們都很知趣，當然不再　去了。……還有一件事，就在前天晚上罷？有一個穿西裝的沙年，也曾向我查問他。不過這少年祇問起有沒有一個女人在他房裏過夜。我吿訴他有的，他就氣什麼似的。」　　霍桑又急忙掏出那張余甘棠的照片來。「查問的人，可是這個，」　　那七十一號接過了照片細細一瞧，緩緩地說道：「好像是的，不過我瞧見那個人時，好像在發脾氣，跟這個照片上的笑臉，有些兒不同。」　　霍桑又將照片收回了，又從衣袋裏拿出一張十元的法幣來。　　「七十一號，你眞聰明。這個給你酬勞。」　（六八）客滿  潘仲長作</p>

<p>㳺藝界獻給評劇界的管見  子嘉　　我現在寫的這篇文字，是想把數年來心中對於評劇界所想說的，發洩一下，換言之，就是對於評劇家的批評，據我個人的意見，近十幾年來南北批評戲劇的文字，完全以客觀的立塲，以藝術爲論據的，眞似鳳毛麟角，雜誌報章所登載的評劇文字，不是狂捧，就是亂　，還有人専好拿過去的伶人與現伶相比較，其實他本人對於所提及的過去名伶，曾吾得見或曾否欣賞其劇，還是一個問題，又有一種人專喜歡批評戲中極微細的地方，如同某一個字沒有咬準，某一個腔使的欠佳，某一個的動作，與當年老譚所表演的不符，此外更有類如記帳式的文字，千篇一律沒有多大變化，請問如上面所說的幾種評劇文字，對於改進及提倡戲劇上，有何益處　　我現在提出一個問題，請一讀者予以答覆，就是寫評劇文字的目的，究竟爲什麼？我想，一般讀者一定回答說，最大目的是要把這一種藝術發揚而改進之，根據這個目的，可見現在的多數評劇家的論調，是完全錯誤的。譬如說有一個伶人對於劇情服裝及唱詞的不對地方，加以改良，一般評劇家就要加以抨擊，說他破壞舊規，試問在這種情况之下，誰敢大胆嘗試平劇還有改進的希望嗎　　依我個人的見解，一般評劇家不要斤斤於某個腔調或某個小動作的吹毛求疵，而應該從大的方面，如某戲情節之不合理，某劇唱詞之俚俗不通，或某戲服裝之不合時代等，著文鼓吹而改進之，對於有思想伶人的合理創作，亦應加以鼓勵，如此則平劇藝術或者還有發揚改進的希望，吾則像過去和現在一般評劇家，專門寫作頌揚故伶捧罵今伶的文字，請問對於平劇的前途，有何裨益呢？觀影指南  農村　　我們費了錢去看一張影片，當然希望要取得相當的代價，但是在電影廣吿上每張新片都是說得天花亂墜的，怎能知道它內容的好壞呢？現在這裏有個檢別的方法，介紹給各位讀者：　　西洋影片的放映，　是分有五種等級，就是「隆重獻映」，「榮譽獻映」，「特殊獻映」，「獻映」，「開映」。故就其等級上可以看出它本身的價値來。　　「隆重獻映」——這種影片大多是取材於各大文豪的著作，含有文藝意味的，可列入必看之刋。　　「榮譽獻映」——這類的影片，都是具有正當的意義，其內容都是很緊張的，並且還能啟發觀衆智慧的，所以也有一看的價値。　　「特殊獻映」——凡是已經放映過的，而曾受觀衆稱許的，並且曾受觀衆要求重映的都列入「特殊獻映一，也可以一看。　　「獻映」——這種片子大多軟性的，艷情的，內容都是卿卿我我的一類，除了少數之外，大都不能啟發觀衆的心理，所以意志不堅的靑年頂好不看。　　「開映」——這類影片都是神怪的，不痛不癢的，它能使正在徬徨的靑年的心裏搖動，印上不良印象，自以不看爲妙。　　此外還有「特准獻映」，這種影片的內容都是具有作用的，須要得到當地的特准，然後可以公映，　要知這內容的作用，也不無一看的價値。　　以上是指　片而說的，國片現在根本沒有等級。並且每張都冠以「降重獻映」的字樣，那是宣傳者的誇大在了。人鬼世界公映　　　　　一　　好萊塢一九四〇年，各界稱頌，允為奇片之「人鬼世界」已定星期四起在南京大戯院公映，情節奇妙，非常新　，對於靈魂學，頗有新的見解，人鬼之間的靈的接觸，以及一切果報的前因後果，都有詳細的分析。故事方面，充滿了友誼上的厚義，足使人感　不止。主角除却爾斯威尼迦，奧威勃萊史密斯，哈利卡萊等三個白髮老翁之外，尚有琪恩派克，李却卡爾遜，濟濟一堂，盛况空前。監製人李迦未斯，導演愛德華蘇　倫都是非常的成功。「刁劉氏」中的　插曲  稜白　　充滿反封建氣味　　潘金　在一般歷史觀點上，本個淫蕩的女性，但經歐陽予倩先生改編過來，成了一部反對建制度的社會性作品，使人獲到新的認識。　　最近，國聯攝製大量民間電影，其中的一部「刁劉氏」，編導人馬徐維邦，不顧它的故事再在銀幕上介紹，因此加以歷史的考據和分析，於是認爲刁劉氏的環境，正和潘金蓮一樣，同是封建制度下不幸的犧牲者，因此，他就以改編的手法，把她寫成了一個充滿熱情的具有革命力的女性。　　現在，該片已將全部攝竣，顧蘭君的刁劉氏，在遊四門一塲，挿有一支臨刑曲，由秦章李雋靑二人合作，曲中充滿反封建的氣味，原詞如下：　　（白）一失足成千古恨。　　（唱）有女嫁庸扌，不如活掩　　埋。　　談——詩書他不愛，　　說——風情他不解，　　這樣的夫妻誰能耐？　　（白）唉！　　（唱）犯罪豈本心——　　錯死更意外——　　細算來——　　傷人的是貌，　　毒人的是扌，　　殺人的是婚姻，　　吃人的是媒介，　　說甚麼！　　命運該，　　分明是——　　萬惡的姻緣把人害！　　簡訊（一）「國華」影星陶　　由及洪犂顧鑑等發起「幼人劇團，」擬聘陳娟娟嚴鳳凰爲基本團員，姜明等担任導演，聞該團將採用許幸之所著之兒童劇本，作大觀模之兒童戲劇運動。（二）梅花館主主編之「半月戲劇劇，二卷十一期昨已出版，內容均爲名貴作品，譚富英毛世來梁小鸞張君秋白玉艷諸名伶之專輯，允爲新頴，中國圖書公司總經售。怎樣攝製電影？　（六）  德　　我們知道世界上各種物體的顏色，可分爲數種，不過這許多種的顏色，可　成　種原色，卽紫色，綠色和橙紅色。憑了這種原色，配合成其他種種不同的複色。若是我們用三隻幻燈，第一隻燈前裝紫玻璃　塊，所以發紫光；第二隻裝綠玻璃，所以發綠光；第三隻裝橙紅玻璃，所以發橙紅光。（三塊玻璃都是圓形）假使現在我們將這三種光，同時照在一方布幕上，並使三光發出的圓影局部交錯。（見圖）在中央，三光拼合的地方，則現白色。在旁邊，橙紅光和紫光拼合，成玫瑰色，橙紅光和綠色拼成黃色，紫光和綠光拼成藍色，於是五彩電影的構成便依照這個原理而得。科學家爲攝製五彩電影，特製了一種具有三個鏡頭的開麥拉機在這三個鏡頭前每個都配上一種原色的玻璃，名爲濾色器。所以一件被攝的東西，必須經過三個鏡頭，拍成二張像片，當被攝的東西經過紫色鏡頭時，那麼東西上的紫色，藍色，深紅色都能透過，不過深淺程度顯然不同，而　色則被阻，不能作用於軟片的溴化銀上，所攝得的軟片，自身毫無彩色，所以在放映時，必須使放映機後的强烈燈光經過同樣的三個原色的濾色器，於是物體的天然彩色便顯現於幕上了。</p>

<h3>Mitsubishi Branch Manager's Explanation: Anglo-Japanese Relations Still Tense; Two Japanese Nationals Expelled from England; Craigie Visited Japanese Foreign Minister Yesterday for Talks</h3>
<p>London: Amidst tense Anglo-Japanese relations, one of the nine Japanese nationals arrested on suspicion of espionage was released yesterday evening. This individual was Makihara, the manager of the London branch of Mitsubishi Corporation, who had been arrested just last Friday. The released Japanese national, besides stating that he was "treated well," refused to make any criticism. At the same time, a spokesperson for the Japanese embassy formally stated that the situation arising from the arrest of Japanese nationals seemed to be "worsening." Observers felt that these remarks evidenced the seriousness of the situation. Well-informed sources said that the Japanese ambassador met with the British Foreign Secretary on Saturday to request an explanation for the arrests but did not demand the release of the arrested Japanese nationals. Observers said that Shigemitsu sent a detailed account of his discussions to the Japanese Foreign Ministry in Tokyo for further instructions. Foreign Minister Matsuoka, considering that Shigemitsu had not reached an agreement with the British Foreign Secretary, has now decided not to take any further action and will wait for future developments. (International News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>London: Yesterday, British authorities released one of the arrested Japanese nationals based on the Aliens Order, while expelling two others. British Home Secretary Sir Anderson issued an order yesterday, stating that the government had obtained sufficient evidence to confirm that Makihara, the arrested manager of Mitsubishi Corporation, was indeed a spy. Therefore, Makihara was released from Brixton Prison last night. However, Tanabe, the deputy manager of Mitsui &amp; Co., remains detained in prison. Before Makihara's release, the British government issued a statement saying, "The authorities have considered this matter and now that it is impossible to obtain conclusive proof, there is no need to continue detaining him." At the same time, Taiwanese Bank employee Takayuki Eguchi and Mrs. Yoshii were expelled for conducting pro-fascist activities in England. A spokesperson for the Japanese embassy told the press that although he had not formally received instructions from Tokyo, he still believed that the British government's explanation for Makihara and Tanabe was not sufficient. Sources reported that Japanese Ambassador to the UK, Shigemitsu Mamoru, issued a strong warning to British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax on Sunday, saying that the British government's arrest of Japanese nationals would "endanger the work of reaching an understanding between the two countries." (United Press, 6th)</p>
<p>London: Makihara, the director of the London branch of Mitsubishi Corporation, who was arrested here last Friday, was released last night and returned to his London residence. It is reported that Home Secretary and Minister for Internal Security Anderson carefully considered the Makihara case and concluded that the evidence was insufficient to warrant continued detention, so he ordered his release. Earlier, a spokesperson for the Japanese embassy stated that the Japanese ambassador Shigemitsu believed that the British Foreign Secretary Halifax's explanation of the arrest of Japanese nationals in London was not entirely satisfactory but hoped that a satisfactory solution could still be found to restore peaceful relations. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>New York: A report from London last night stated that the release of Makihara, the manager of Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan, was not sufficient to prove that Britain had adopted a policy of compromise towards Japan. In fact, Britain is continuing to arrest reputable Japanese nationals. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Due to the increasingly deteriorating Anglo-Japanese relations, the Singapore authorities ordered all volunteer forces in Singapore to resume strict training from August 7th. The atmosphere in Singapore is unusually tense. (5th)</p>
<p>Tokyo Authorities Decide on Countermeasures</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Tokyo reports that the British government's arrest of Japanese nationals has now spread beyond London to overseas colonies such as Rangoon, Singapore, and Hong Kong. The number of those arrested has reached nine. The Japanese Foreign Ministry, in view of the escalating situation, held an important meeting at 1:00 PM today, solemnly discussing countermeasures for two hours. Afterwards, they contacted the Army and Navy authorities to discuss the results. It is said that the Foreign Ministry has decided to temporarily adopt the following policy:</p>
<p>Konoe and Koiso Discuss Southern Advance Policy</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Tokyo reports that General Koiso met with Prime Minister Konoe at the Prime Minister's official residence this afternoon to frankly exchange views on the Southern issue. The two agreed on the fundamental policy of advancing south. General Koiso is scheduled to meet with the four ministers of the Foreign Affairs and Army and Navy within a few days to exchange views on the issue, and then discuss specific measures with Prime Minister Konoe. (5th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to semi-official Japanese sources, Prime Minister Konoe and former Colonial Minister General Koiso have completely agreed on the relationship between Japan and the Dutch East Indies. Political figures believe that Koiso will be appointed as the special envoy to India and the head of the economic survey team. (Haitong News Agency, 6th) Conduct diplomatic measures. (1) Japan's arrest of British spies is purely a domestic measure. On the contrary, the British measures are a sinister means of retaliation under this pretext and contain political implications. However, the Japanese side will temporarily avoid taking retaliatory measures against the British side's illegal acts. (2) Temporarily observe the extent of the British retaliatory actions. (3) Depending on the new developments in Britain, appropriate and effective means will be adopted. Foreign Minister Matsuoka has now decided to invite Ambassador Craigie to the province within one or two days to seek a formal explanation of the case and lodge a serious protest with him. In short, the Japanese side intends to pay attention to the British movements temporarily within a few days. Even if the British illegal behavior stops at this level, it is not the Japanese side's wish to resolve the case in a way that both sides bear their own responsibilities. Therefore, its attitude is very tough. (6th)</p>
<p>British Ambassador Visits Japanese Foreign Minister</p>
<p>Tokyo: British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie visited the Japanese Foreign Minister at his official residence at 5:00 PM today. It is reported that during the seventy-minute meeting, the two exchanged views on the recent arrests of British and Japanese nationals. The atmosphere during the meeting was quite calm and friendly. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>London: A correspondent for the "Times" stated that the Japanese official statement, which pointed out that Britain and British territories arrested Japanese nationals as a retaliatory action for Japan's arrest of British nationals, was not the case. The British Foreign Secretary had already stated that the Japanese authorities had the right to conduct inquiries that they deemed appropriate for their own interests, and the British government did not question this. The British government has detained many people for the sake of British security. In addition to Japanese nationals, British and foreign nationals have also been detained. However, the circumstances of the arrest of British nationals in Japan and the criticisms in Japanese official circles and newspapers that defame British honor have made the British government uneasy and had to protest. The British government has always been cautious and does not want to incur accusations of being unfriendly to Japan. Now that the government has stated that the arrest of British nationals was not out of unfriendly intentions towards Britain, the British government feels that it may as well adopt some precautionary measures that it has intended to take for a long time. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Japan Did Not Protest Kobayashi's Arrest</p>
<p>Singapore: Toyota, the consul-general here, requested today to be informed of the details of the arrest of Kobayashi Ichiro, the manager of the Japan Oriental News Agency and reporter for Domei News Agency, but after learning the details, he did not protest. Toyota went to meet with the Colonial Secretary of this place, Mr. Weisberg, and asked about the reasons for the arrest of the Japanese reporter. Mr. Weisberg told him that Kobayashi was arrested by the authorities here in accordance with the Defence Regulations to prevent his actions from being harmful to public order and defence. Mr. Weisberg also said that he was prepared to accept the Japanese protest after the Japanese Consul-General reported to Tokyo, but Toyota's protest has not yet been filed. The authorities here have recently allowed Kobayashi's wife to visit her husband. (United Press, 6th)</p>
<p>Anti-British Sentiment Surges Among Japanese People</p>
<p>Tokyo: Many leaders of political and cultural groups in Japan visited the British Consul in Shimonoseki today, requesting him to close the consulate and requesting several British shops to close down. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>The "Miyako Shimbun" in Tokyo commented on the British authorities' arrest of Japanese nationals today, saying that the next few days will be the most critical period for deciding the future relationship between Britain and Japan. The "Hochi Shimbun" learned that the Japanese government will carefully monitor Britain's actions in the next few days. The "Nichinichi Shimbun" urged the Foreign Ministry to handle the issue with a firm attitude, and said that if diplomatic negotiations become extremely bad, it may be inevitable to resort to force, but efforts should be made to turn misfortune into blessing. The "Kokumin Shimbun" published a headline "Japanese Nationals Retiring from London," saying that Britain created pretexts to arrest Japanese nationals in London and other places in order to retaliate. However, it is too early to decide today whether Britain is risking war with Japan by its actions. The release of Makihara, the president of the London branch of Mitsubishi Trading Company, who was arrested on August 2nd, was widely reported in all the evening newspapers here yesterday. Makihara's wife took her son to a resort in Hokkaido a day before the telegram of Makihara's arrest arrived in Japan. She will return to Tokyo on the 8th. According to sources from Mitsubishi's head office in Tokyo, they were confident that Makihara would be released and will ask Makihara to remain stationed in London. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Spies Actively Engaged in Activities in Hawaii; US Democratic Congressman Announces Sufficient Evidence Obtained</h3>
<p>Washington: Democratic Congressman Scruggle claimed last night that he had obtained sufficient evidence from Hawaii to prove that "there are indeed Fifth Column elements active there." He said that as soon as the evidence is fully collected, he would submit it to the House. The Congressman clearly pointed out that the Fifth Column activities he referred to were those of Japanese nationals. He said he had received countless letters from residents and officials residing in Honolulu, confirming his previous suspicions about the Fifth Column activities there. According to his information, the Fifth Column includes a large number of Japanese residents who had previously served in the Japanese Army. Scruggle revealed that he had informed Honolulu's representative in Washington that he would publicly announce the matter to the House, and challenged the representative to publicly refute the report. He said, "I will be happy to give Honolulu's representative every opportunity to prove that the information I have obtained is accurate. I would very much like to have a thorough discussion of this matter. There are countless people in Honolulu who are engaged in activities that are detrimental to the United States. Reliable sources have stated that the existence of a Fifth Column there is undoubtedly closely related to a certain country and is subject to its orders. I have obtained all the evidence to prove that they hate the United States. They often meet to discuss expanding anti-American activities. They do not allow good American people to participate in these meetings." Hawaii representative King told reporters that he had not received the information mentioned by Scruggle, but he believed that the matter was not credible. He also said that no illegal activities had occurred in Hawaii. (United Press, 6th)</p>
<h3>Japan Protests Oil Embargo; US Prepares Reply</h3>
<p>Washington: Acting Secretary of State Welles stated yesterday that the United States is preparing to reply to Japan's protest regarding the restrictions on aviation gasoline in the near future. As for Japan's opposition to the ban on the export of aircraft fuel in the Western Hemisphere, Welles declined to comment. Secretary of State Hull has begun his routine vacation after returning from the Havana Conference. Welles will continue to serve as Acting Secretary of State in the State Department. (United Press, 6th)</p>
<p>Washington: Acting Secretary of State Welles declined to comment yesterday on the news from Shanghai that the U.S. Consul in China had received various protests about Japan's increased restrictions on American trade in China. (United Press, 6th)</p>
<h3>Salvation Army Personnel Arrested; Seven Arrested in Japan; Allegedly on Suspicion of Espionage</h3>
<p>Tokyo: An Army Ministry bulletin announced that seven Salvation Army personnel were arrested by the military police on July 31 on suspicion of espionage. Among those arrested were Commander Uemaru and Secretary-General Segawa, who were of Japanese nationality. According to a spokesman for the Army Ministry, regardless of whether religion is needed for the life of the country, the Salvation Army is deeply concerned about the ideological defense of the country. Therefore, for these religious workers, "who use faith as a cover and act as 'informants, foreign spies, and pioneers or training grounds for foreign ideological warfare,' and who undermine the ideology of the country," strict action must be taken to deal with them.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A Review of the So-Called Four-Nation Economic Bloc</h3>
<p>Over the past few days, Italy has repeatedly disseminated a fiery atmosphere, claiming that the world's four omnipotent nations—Italy, Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union—will form a great economic bloc to compete with Britain and subdue it to death. Assuming this is indeed a brewing reality with the potential for realization, its impact on Britain's life or death, however, will be temporarily put aside. The alliance of these four nations undoubtedly stands as a grand structure capable of captivating global attention.</p>
<p>Such grand structures are rare. An idealistically pleasing grand structure often encounters inherent and acquired obstacles, ultimately disappointing those who eagerly anticipate its early realization. Germany and Italy have already been fighting shoulder to shoulder, sharing a unity of purpose. Mathematically, this represents two out of four, indicating that the grand structure has already achieved half of its potential, lacking only the remaining half. Moreover, since August of last year, Germany and the Soviet Union have concluded an agreement, dividing Poland equally. The Soviet Union's annexation in the Baltic region and its expansion in Southeast Europe have factually confirmed the tacit understanding between Germany and the Soviet Union. Recently, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's report has further morally elucidated the harmony between Germany and the Soviet Union. As for Italy and the Soviet Union, there are no issues in Southeast Europe, and it is said that relations are already harmonious, with trade about to be adjusted. From this perspective, although the signs of Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union forming an economic bloc remain elusive to outsiders, as long as the Soviet Union also intends to closely associate with Germany and Italy to the point of becoming an economic bloc, this triangular love affair is bound to succeed. The Soviet Union's intentions remain unknown, but it has certainly never stated that it does not have these intentions. Assuming the Soviet Union has this intention in the future, three out of four, the remaining gap is small. Now, let's consider Japan. In its current situation, Japan eagerly seeks camaraderie, 'Birds singing in harmony, seeking a responsive voice.' Whoever endorses its wishes, whoever approves of its actions, becomes its appreciated ally. It originally had a pact with Germany and Italy, an anti-Comintern agreement, though it is said that times have changed, and this has now been abandoned. Including the Soviet Union in the ideal role of the four-nation economic bloc precludes discussing anti-communist sentiments. However, since this case remains in the historical archives and has not been cancelled, its relationship with Germany and Italy is undoubtedly different from others. Among them, Italy truly possesses sincere enthusiasm for Japan. As for Germany, in order to counter Britain, it naturally 'has high hopes' for Japan under certain conditions. It may be worth making an assumption: assuming that Germany and Japan accommodate each other in the future, and the anticipated conditions actually coincide, then the grand structure of the so-called four-nation bloc is only a very small percentage short mathematically, that is, only the issues of the Soviet Union and Japan remain. Please review this remainder.</p>
<p>On the first of this month, at the joint session of the Soviet Union's Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities, Mr. Molotov, in his elevated position as Chairman of the People's Committee and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, reported on foreign policy. His entire report was clear and concise, except for the section on Japan, which was hesitant and reserved, allowing for the maximum degree of maneuverability. He said: 'Broadly speaking, it seems that Japan has a tendency to improve relations. If both sides can recognize the necessity of removing obstacles, it is not impossible for the Soviet Union and Japan to improve relations. However, the so-called "new political structure" plan of the new Japanese government is not very clear. The Japanese government's slogan of advancing south has attracted the attention of major sectors in Japan, as they are extremely interested in the changes in Europe. Although, in many respects, their political ambitions are not yet clear: the same is true of Soviet-Japanese relations.' When discussing Soviet-Japanese relations, one must immediately instinctively associate them with China. Therefore, please also mention it in connection: in Mr. Molotov's report, the section on China maintained a clear and concise style. He said: 'Our relations with the great nation of China have been extremely friendly since the two countries signed the non-aggression pact. China is now fighting for its survival.' These few words express the Soviet Union's intentions towards China, which, compared to his statement about his intentions towards Japan, show that even if it is possible to improve Soviet-Japanese relations, it will not affect the Soviet Union's friendly relations with the great nation of China, which is currently fighting for survival. Furthermore, the deterioration of Soviet-Japanese relations is more obvious from Japan's invasion of China and the Soviet Union's aid to China in recent years: but the deterioration of relations is not recent but historical, not because of China, but (1) because of Japan's northward advance policy, (2) because Japan is blatantly assuming the role of the eastern vanguard of the anti-communist crusade. The Soviet Union has long since ceased to mention the anti-communist camp, which Japan has already abandoned, since August of last year. In this report by Mr. Molotov, the historical deterioration of Soviet-Japanese relations caused by Japan's northward advance policy, which has been managed and operated for decades, cleverly pointed out that Japan may change its policy in the future and switch to advancing south, cleverly contrasting this as a reason for the Soviet Union and Japan to improve relations. At the same time, Mr. Molotov also cleverly expressed that he does not trust the political ambitions of the main sectors in Japan, who are determined and determined to switch to advancing south and abandoning advancing north. Under the expression of distrust, how much possibility is there for the Soviet Union and Japan to improve relations? How much possibility is there for economic cooperation between the two countries? How much possibility is there for the so-called four-nation economic bloc?</p>
<p>To go a step further: If Japan does not abandon its aggression against China, then even if it launches a southern advance, it cannot be regarded as abandoning the northern advance, and it cannot make the Soviet Union believe that it no longer needs to worry about the threat of Japan's northern advance and improve relations with it. Even if Japan suddenly changes its mind and faithfully abandons its northward advance and advances south, and Soviet-Japanese relations improve, but to say that the Soviet Union is therefore willing to abandon its neutral policy, is even willing to sacrifice all possible opportunities for multifaceted development in the economy, and is even willing to accept constraints and join the economic bloc of Germany, Italy, Japan, or any other number of countries, according to the Soviet Union's national policy, is also a fundamentally unimaginable phenomenon. The so-called four-nation bloc is just a castle in the air!</p>
<h3>If Japan Attacks Vietnam, France is Determined to Resist; Vietnamese Troops Cancel Demobilization; Troops Stationed at Coastal Forts</h3>
<p>London: According to a dispatch from the French western border correspondent of the Daily Mail to Vichy, France is determined to resist any Japanese attack on French Indochina. The demobilization of Vietnamese native troops has now been cancelled, and troops have been stationed at all coastal forts. French warships stationed in the Far East have all been ordered to go to Vietnam. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Kunming: The Central News Agency recently stated that Governor-General Decoux of Vietnam recently telegraphed the French Consulate-General in Kunming, allowing the release of goods from the Haiphong warehouse and the restoration of commercial transportation along the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. The agency stated that General Decoux also promised to fully assist the Chinese side's interests in future Sino-Vietnamese commercial transportation. In addition, Chinese business circles stated that the British blockade of the Burma Road has caused dissatisfaction among the kings of the northern mountains in Burma. The kings of the northern mountains have encouraged trade between their countries and China in the past two years and are very opposed to the blockade of the Burma Road. All the kings support China's resistance against Japan, have a deep understanding of Japan's policy, and are very disgusted by it. Furthermore, according to business circles, many of the kings are descendants of northerners from China, because their ancestors moved from North China to Burma during the Manchu invasion at the end of the Ming Dynasty.

<p>Hong Kong: When reporters sailed to Hong Kong, they only saw three destroyers berthed outside Haiphong harbor. However, this week, the French side has adopted a firm attitude towards Japan's demands, fearing that Tokyo will increase its demands and want to obtain a naval base in Vietnam. Although Vietnam's French military strength is insufficient to cope with a large-scale invasion, most French people have expressed their attitude and are determined not to give up this valuable colony easily without a fight. The number of the monitoring team dispatched by the Japanese side to monitor the transportation on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to prevent military supplies from being transported into China has increased to one hundred. Japanese planes also fly back and forth to Hanoi every day. When the Japanese inspectors arrived, the French government provided government offices for the Japanese side to use as offices and equipped them with many cars for their use. Unexpectedly, this move opened the door to Japan's covetousness. The members of the monitoring team have engaged in extensive military and economic surveys in Vietnam and have detailed roads that are completely unrelated to the prohibition of arms shipments to China. Although the French authorities treat the Japanese with great courtesy and often treat them to lavish banquets, Governor Decoux of Vietnam has expressed a firm attitude this week, deferring any Japanese demands to the Vichy government for approval. Decoux also refused to allow a Japanese ship carrying more than one hundred Japanese people and a large amount of military supplies to land. The Japanese ship is still berthed outside Haiphong, next to the three destroyers. The Japanese inspectors have not yet questioned the French side's refusal to allow them to land.

<p>Guangzhou: According to Japanese sources, the nonchalant remarks made to reporters by a staff officer of a certain South China army who recently returned from a week's tour of Vietnam have attracted great attention from the general public. He said that the French side's assistance to Chongqing is quite "generous," and simply closing the route through Vietnam is not enough to eliminate it. Before the Japanese inspectors arrived, a large amount of military materials supplied to Chongqing was dispersed to various parts of Vietnam. The news of France's collapse has not yet been announced to the people of Vietnam, and the people there have a good impression of Japan. Finally, he warned the Vietnamese authorities that if they overestimate their strength, they will incur misfortune. (Reuters, 6th)</p>

<h3>Generals from Guangdong, Guangxi, and Other Provinces Reportedly to Go to Chongqing</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Generals from Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, and Suiyuan are reportedly about to go to Chongqing to participate in a military conference. It is rumored that the discussions may be about dealing with the battle situations in Yichang and southern Shanxi. (United Press, 6th)</p>
<h3>Remnants of Japanese Troops in Yichang Break Through; More Than Half Annihilated</h3>

<h3>Japanese Troops Fear Epidemics, No Major War Expected in Summer; Japanese Troops Near Yichang Withdraw to Hankou, Attack on Western Hunan Unlikely in Near Future</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The only military development of real significance between China and Japan at the moment is the relative quiet on all fronts and the reduced bombing of Chongqing by Japanese aircraft. According to well-informed Chinese sources, no major war is likely during the summer months, as the Japanese fear cholera, malaria, and other epidemics. If the Japanese launch any large-scale offensive, it will likely be between September and October. Local sources remain skeptical about reports that Japanese military commanders in China do not favor further incursions into the Chinese interior, believing that this depends on future international developments. If the Japanese believe that Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are preoccupied elsewhere, they may attempt another large-scale offensive against Chongqing. According to dispatches from the front lines near Yichang, the main force of Japanese troops stationed near Yichang and on the south bank of the Yangtze River opposite Yichang has withdrawn to Hankou, leaving only small detachments to garrison key points. The previous concerns that the Japanese might attempt to enter Sichuan province via the eastern edge of the Hubei-Sichuan border and Enshi have now completely dissipated, as the Japanese have not undertaken any significant actions in that area. Rumors of large numbers of Japanese warships and transport ships concentrating near Dongting Lake, and of Japanese aircraft repeatedly bombing cities on the western shore of Dongting Lake, led some to believe that the Japanese might attempt to attack western Hunan from the western shore. However, in the immediate future, no large-scale war is expected in that area. The number of Japanese air raids on Chongqing, in terms of both frequency and the number of aircraft involved, has indeed decreased. Since Japan began its intense bombing of Chongqing on May 26 with the aim of "destroying Chongqing and crushing China's spirit of resistance," Japanese aircraft have raided almost daily, with sorties involving over 100 aircraft, sometimes as many as 160. While some individuals are expressing concern about the potential long-term impact of the sustained Japanese bombing, aviation experts predict that the Japanese air raids will eventually decrease, as these large-scale attacks are excessively costly in terms of personnel and equipment. This prediction appears to be accurate, as even during good weather, Japanese aircraft are not bombing Chongqing every day. Even when they do attack, the number of aircraft is greatly reduced compared to before. The most recent air raid, on August 3, involved only 36 Japanese aircraft from Yuncheng, Shanxi province. According to Chinese sources, another noteworthy fact is that Japanese aircraft are no longer concentrating their bombing on Chongqing itself. Recently, Japanese aircraft have repeatedly bombed cities near Chongqing, while ignoring Chongqing altogether. Chinese sources claim this is because the Japanese have suffered excessive losses in recent air raids on Chongqing. In addition to believing that the Japanese have now abandoned their attempt to crush China's spirit of resistance by bombing Chongqing, local Chinese and foreign observers believe that the current decrease in Japanese air raids on Chongqing is due to Japanese efforts to conserve gasoline and equipment, especially due to the US ban on the export of military materials, oil, and aircraft fuel. Local people generally disbelieve the claim that Japan is experiencing a severe shortage of aircraft fuel. According to those familiar with the situation in Japan, the Japanese military is constantly undertaking a four-year national defense program. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>China's Fighting Strength Growing Stronger - Excerpt from a Conversation with Japanese POWs -</h3>
<p>Somewhere in Northern Jiangxi - A Central News Agency reporter recently interviewed two Japanese soldiers, Private First Class Yoshiki Nagatani and Private Second Class Masaji Matsui, captured near Nanchang.

<h3>Already Failed</h3>
<p>Hong Kong - The Hong Kong government's recent evacuation of British women and children from Hong Kong has provoked popular opposition unprecedented in recent years. Newspapers continue to publish strongly worded letters of opposition, and the public continues to discuss the matter. Newspapers have also published articles attacking and ridiculing the measure to the best of their ability. A public petition to cancel the evacuation has been launched, and the response has been strong. The petition lists the various drawbacks of the measure. The vacant residences left by the evacuees are being rented by Chinese families. Many wealthy families who moved here from Shanghai at the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War have no intention of leaving Hong Kong. Chinese and non-British foreign residents who are not affected by the evacuation order continue to live here peacefully and are not panicking. Only a small number have voluntarily moved away. Furthermore, the authorities have encouraged several thousand Chinese refugees from outside the territory to return to their home villages, with the Japanese guaranteeing their safety.

<h3>Romania and Bulgaria Agree on the Cession of All of Dobruja; Romanian-Hungarian Negotiations Still Underway</h3>
<p>Bucharest - According to reliable sources, Romania has announced that it is prepared to cede all of Dobruja to Bulgaria, according to the borders of 1912. This is the result of negotiations in the Bulgarian capital between the Bulgarian government and the Romanian special envoy, the Romanian Minister to Italy, Catargiu. The negotiations lasted three days. The Romanian special envoy was only instructed to cede Southern Dobruja, but after repeated discussions, he agreed to return all of Dobruja.

<p>Budapest - Although the issue of Romania's cession of Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria was decided today in the Bulgarian capital, many difficulties remain to be resolved in the Romanian-Hungarian issue. The people of Outer Transylvania are strongly protesting against the cession of certain areas to Hungary. The Romanian government is also paying close attention. It is rumored that Hungary is also demanding the western plains and four cities of Outer Transylvania. If these two areas are combined, Romania must cede 21,000 square miles of land to Hungary. It is rumored that the Romanian government also wants to resolve the issue of exchanging people at the same time, but Hungary's desires do not stop there. Arad, Satu Mare, and the Cergău Mountains are also on the list of demands. It is expected that Romania will negotiate for more favorable terms.

Kirchensteins also said, "Since July 21st and 22nd, the dark period of the Latvian working masses has passed. A new life has begun. Under the Stalin Constitution, the Latvian annals have unfolded a page of prosperity and freedom. Latvian laborers and cultural figures, who in the past selflessly and heroically fought against the oppressors in the country, have cultivated a spirit of steel among the Latvian people, finally winning victory and declaring the establishment of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic." Finally, amid thunderous cheers, Kirchensteins expressed that the Soviet Union would surely allow Latvia to join the Soviet Union. After Kirchensteins' speech, other members of the Latvian Parliamentary Delegation, Bisenieks and Papazis, also spoke in Latvian, representing the Latvian people in requesting the Soviet Supreme Soviet to annex Latvia into the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>At this point, Akhunbabaev, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek Republic, on behalf of the Soviet government, delivered a brilliant speech in the Uzbek language, welcoming Latvia to join the Soviet Union. Akhunbabaev used the actual situation in Uzbekistan to prove the extraordinary victory of Lenin and Stalin's national policy. Akhunbabaev pointed out that in the era of Imperial Russia, Uzbekistan was originally a backward country, but at present, it has become an advanced state in industry, agriculture, and culture. Finally, Akhunbabaev proposed the law on Latvia's annexation into the Soviet Union, which was unanimously approved by the separate votes of the two chambers. At the same time, in accordance with the Soviet Constitution, the two chambers also decided that the Latvian Republic would elect members of the Latvian Republic to the Soviet Supreme Soviet. The election date is determined by the Soviet Supreme Soviet. When Chairman of the Congress, Shvernik, announced the passage of the law on Latvia's annexation into the Soviet Union, the entire venue burst into thunderous cheers, and the members of the Plenipotentiary Delegation of the Latvian Parliament congratulated each other, shook hands with the deputies, and loudly praised the Soviet people, Stalin, and Molotov.</p>

In short, the Lithuanian people have already swept away their depression, proudly looking forward and moving forward along the path of the great Stalin." (TASS dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Summons of Soviet Experts: Chinese Art Conference, Relics from Anyang Prove Close Relationship Between Ancient Chinese Culture and Eastern Siberia</h3>
<p>TASS Special Dispatch: Recently, a Chinese Art History Conference was held here, attended by 200 people, including artists, experts, and historians. During the conference, participants discussed in detail the findings of Soviet experts who studied the rare and unique exhibits at the previous Chinese Art Exhibition. Mr. Goru Harifa, a member of the Oriental Culture Museum, reported on the art of the Shang and Yin dynasties of China. The report was based on the results of Soviet experts' research on ancient artifacts discovered during excavations in Anyang. The Chinese government sent ivory carvings of birds and animals to the Chinese Art Exhibition, proving that Chinese art was highly developed 2,000 years ago. Professor Fikislev said that the ancient artifacts discovered during the excavation in Anyang were the same as those discovered by the Soviets in eastern Siberia. This proves the close relationship between ancient China and the culture of eastern Siberia. Mr. Kassin, a member of the Leningrad Museum, reported on Buddhist paintings discovered by Russian scientist Koslov in Mongolia from 1907 to 1909. These objects show the development of Chinese art in the 11th century. Scientist Alexiev also recited 18th-century poems praising Chinese painting, which aroused great interest. The Oriental Culture Museum has recently published a monograph on Chinese art, which focuses on describing modern Chinese anti-Japanese art.</p>

<h3>British Air Force Raids Germany on a Large Scale, Dropping 14 Tons of Bombs; Long-Range Cannons Set Up on the Northern Coast of France; Germany Will Launch an Aerial Blitzkrieg</h3>
<p>London: When German bombers appeared in waves off the southeastern and northeastern coasts of England, the British Air Ministry also stated that the British Air Force had launched an unprecedented large-scale air raid on Germany. As a result of the air raid, the British side dropped 14 tons of bombs on German territory and its supply centers.

At the same time, the British Admiralty announced that the British minesweeper Mashana had sunk after being hit by a mine. The general public is paying more attention to the Mediterranean, because Italy's actions are becoming more active. (International Telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>London: The Air Ministry issued a communique last night stating that British Air Force bombers attacked the Stokelet oil refinery in the Ruhr area last night, dropping high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs. Fourteen tons of oil pools were destroyed and set on fire. The Kleifeit airfield was also attacked, and a hangar was hit, and the airfield buildings caught fire. All British aircraft returned safely.

People here now believe that the production rate of British aircraft has increased greatly recently and is on par with Germany. (Reuters Telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>London: The British are still discussing the possibility of a German invasion as their material. It is reported that there is no doubt about the news released by the German Propaganda Department that the German side is setting up long-range cannons on the coast of France. The German side had previously trained soldiers to invade Norway in the eastern part of the Baltic Sea in Germany, so now they may use this old trick to invade Britain. However, the British Air Force is on strict alert, and as soon as it hears of a German invasion, it will be able to issue appropriate warnings. The German side may intend to use towed gliders. This method has been proven by the Air Force to be feasible. However, it is generally believed that the German side will use these gliders to transport military supplies for paratroopers, rather than to transport troops. (Reuters Telegram on the 6th)</p>

<h3>Egyptian Political Circles Denounce Italian Propaganda</h3>
<p>Cairo: Egyptian political leaders Dr. Ahmed Maher and Dr. Hussein Heikel successively spoke out, denouncing Italian propaganda in Egypt. Dr. Maher said, "I believe that if Italy and Germany invade Egypt, they will definitely implement their political system, as they have done in the occupied territories. From then on, the existence of the Egyptian nation will be destroyed, and its freedom and independence will also be eliminated. Britain has never oppressed Egypt when it occupied Egypt before, and now it respects Egypt's independence and freedom." Dr. Heikel also said, "Nazism and Fascism do not want to liberate the people, but want to make the people slaves. Under Fascism, there is no happiness of self-respect, freedom, and independence. Because under the tyranny of dictators, freedom and independence are not allowed to exist. Therefore, everyone in Egypt hopes to see the victory of the democratic system protected by Britain, because if Britain wins, the maintenance and progress of Egypt's free political life will be guaranteed. If other countries invade Egypt, the Egyptians will wage a long-term war against them." (Reuters Telegram on the 6th)</p>

<h3>French Youth Practice Group Living, Organize Outdoor Camps for Six Months</h3>
<p>The French newspaper "Le Temps" in Clermont-Ferrand recently reported that a total of 70,000 French youths aged 20 and 21 will form outdoor camps for a period of six months. The situation is roughly the same as that organized by American youths. Some new recruits from the 1939 and 1940 classes who have completed their military service after the Franco-German armistice are included. Subsequently, this youth camp will be organized every year, and representatives from all social classes will participate in it. During these six months, the participating youths will not be given military or political training, but will only be supplemented and guided in spirit and other aspects to become complete citizens. "Because young people can practice group living in the embrace of nature to temper their physique, it is of great benefit to the formation of a sense of honor." The Youth Department has appointed General Doudai to be responsible for preparing the first youth camp. The participating youths must set aside part of their time every day to serve the country, such as irrigating, afforestation, and road construction. As for the internal organization of this youth movement, the smallest unit is a patrol group, which is composed of 20 youths, with one group leader. Seven groups form a team, led by a capable youth who is accustomed to outdoor life. All group leaders and team leaders should be selected from soldiers. Two to five teams form a regiment, and they implement various plans for the welfare of the country, forming a standard, distributing the necessary items to each team and group, maintaining close contact with the headquarters and contacting local authorities. All regimental commanders should be appointed as youth officers, and the headquarters will have one supreme leader, with two departments under him to assist the supreme leader in managing education, labor, and supply matters. The 70,000 young people who are participating in the outdoor camp this time have received notices. (Havas Telegram on the 5th)</p>

<h3>French Authorities Appeal for Domestic Unity, Criticize Separatist Movements</h3>
<p>France, Clermont-Ferrand: Bishop Dubac of the Camp City of the Bretanya region of France, aged 86, is the oldest bishop in the region. He recently published an official letter in "Paris Soir" (published in Clermont-Ferrand), stating that it is inappropriate for a minority of the Bretanya people to organize a separatist movement at this time in the hope of seceding from France. The relationship between our people and France is inseparable. At this time when France is suffering such a tragic ordeal, we will never betray it. Although our people and other French people may have differences of opinion, this has nothing to do with others. Our people and France have a common national history of four centuries. Our people have shed blood for France on land and sea, thereby proving their sincerity. In addition, all aspects of our people's intellectual, social, and economic life have always been closely related to other parts of France. The closeness of the relationship can be seen from this.

<h3>True Account of the European War (3): An Autobiography of a British Air Force Fighter Pilot</h3>
<p>The retreat of the Anglo-French Allied forces from the port of Dunkirk in France was greatly aided by the British fighter planes which, with a small number against a large number, controlled the skies over the port and the English Channel. The following is an account of the combat experience of a certain squadron leader of the British fighter squadron. The original text was also published in the American Life magazine, and is translated and recorded below:</p>
<p>My squadron, consisting of twelve Spitfire fighter planes, was ready and waiting on the morning of the first day of the Anglo-French Allied forces' retreat from Dunkirk. At 9:00 AM, we received orders to take off, soared to an altitude of 20,000 feet, and flew across the North Sea. The squadron flew closely, with radio silence. Looking forward, the coastline was very familiar. A few minutes later, we saw towns and villages around Calais on fire, with thick smoke billowing, the horizon covered by a haze. The squadron sped over the city and patrolled the 50-mile stretch of sky. Not seeing any enemy planes, we decided to descend and circled at an altitude of 4,000 feet. Suddenly, we saw a group of about 60 German planes at an altitude of 15,000 feet, including 20 bombers and 40 fighters. We regretted our squadron's mistake of flying too low. In an instant, the German fighter squadron, many of which were Messerschmitts, roared down and pounced on our squadron. Our planes also split up to meet the attack.</p>
<p>At an altitude of about 10,000 feet, my plane approached a Messerschmitt 110 and I pursued it relentlessly. Twisting and turning in pursuit, the propeller at the front of the plane spun rapidly like the wind. Before long, the German plane dropped rapidly, and I still pursued it closely. It was not easy to keep the German plane in the center of my sights. As soon as I had aimed, I pressed the button. The eight Browning machine guns on my plane fired simultaneously, each firing 1,200 rounds per minute, all aimed at the German plane. The smell of gunpowder from the guns filled the air. When the bullets hit the German plane, sparks flew. I caught a glimpse of the outline of the back of the German pilot's head, turning around, rotating halfway, before stopping moving, presumably hit. In an instant, the German plane caught fire, smoke billowed, and it spun down.</p>
<p>At this point, I looked around to pursue other planes, and discovered that I had flown 50 miles inland. Not seeing any other planes, I turned and flew back to the coast. Suddenly, I was shocked to find that my plane only had enough fuel to fly straight back to the base. If I encountered enemy planes along the way, I didn't know how I would cope. The first battle felt invigorating, but afterwards, thinking about it, I felt a chill down my spine. On the way back to the base, I used the radio to ask each of the other pilots about their results. The first to reply happily reported shooting down an enemy plane. Others reported shooting down one or two planes each, but two planes remained silent, presumably killed in action.</p>
<p>Back at the base, my squadron refueled and reloaded ammunition. Fifteen minutes later, we took off again. Just as we reached an altitude of 10,000 feet over Dunkirk, a large number of Messerschmitt German planes burst out of the clouds and swooped down, almost catching our squadron off guard. These enemy planes were clearly soaring high to cover the bombers in the clouds below. A moment later, bullets whizzed past my ears, and I heard the sound of gunfire from a German plane behind me. Before long, the plane suddenly descended, and I also descended rapidly in pursuit, but in the clouds, the plane disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>My plane then ascended again and I saw the remaining planes at an altitude of 6,000 feet, engaged in a mixed battle with many fighters. Among the enemy planes were several Junkers 88s. I charged into the battle and turned on the radio. I overheard members of my squadron talking, mixed with the sound of gunfire sweeping the German planes. A New Zealand pilot in one plane calmly told a pilot in another plane: "You have a Messerschmitt behind you." The other replied, "Okay, mate."</p>
<p>I then targeted a Junkers 88 to attack. The machine gunner in the rear of the plane immediately opened fire on me. Bullets grazed the windows of the plane, clearly visible. I also aimed at the target and opened fire, firing continuously. The plane shuddered slightly and the German plane was torn in two, then plunged straight down in a ball of fire and smoke. I circled slowly and descended, seeing one of the crew jump out and float down with a parachute.</p>
<p>By this time there were no enemy planes in the sky. I turned around to return to base. On the way home, I called the remaining planes and learned that all the planes were safe. A total of eleven German planes were shot down. Together with the previous battle, we shot down a total of nineteen planes. The first day's victory belonged to us.</p>
<p>On the second day, my squadron set out on patrol again and sent two planes for individual reconnaissance. One was hidden in the clouds at 12,000 feet over Dunkirk and the other was circling at 2,000 feet. The remaining planes flew towards Calais. Halfway there, the plane above the clouds radioed the plane below: "Attention! A large number of Messerschmitts are filling the sky!" The plane below said, "Okay! Don't let them get away. I'm coming!"</p>
<p>Upon receiving the news, my squadron turned and flew into the airspace over the North Sea, seeing several Junkers German planes, protected by Messerschmitts, bombing a torpedo boat and several lifeboats filled with soldiers. The torpedo boat returned fire with anti-aircraft guns. My squadron swooped down unexpectedly, shooting down one enemy plane each. My squadron then ascended together, reorganized, and charged down again. By this time, the enemy planes had scattered. One of the Messerschmitts fled east, and I pounced on it. When the guns fired, the plane spewed black smoke and fell like a leaf. I flew down after it, and was overjoyed to see it crash to the ground.</p>
<p>At that time, the situation of the battle between the two planes above Dunkirk and the German planes was still unknown. Soon, we received a reply from one of the planes, saying that they had shot down four enemy planes. Not long after, the pilot suddenly exclaimed: "My plane has been hit and is on fire." A second or two later, the pilot said again: "There's a destroyer below. I'm going to jump out." A second later, he muttered to himself, "What to do?"</p>
<p>Jumping out of a Spitfire fighter plane is not easy. The best way is to turn the plane upside down, so that your back is facing down, and then jump out. Later, we learned that the pilot did use this method to jump out of the plane. Three days later, he returned to the squadron in a state of disarray, wearing a naval lieutenant's uniform, sailor pants, and carrying a sailor's backpack.</p>
<p>Although the battle was fierce that day, the results were not good, with only eleven German planes shot down.</p>
<p>On the third day, the Allied forces launched a large-scale retreat, and all the German planes were mobilized to obstruct the retreat. At dawn, my squadron went to war. We went back and forth to Dunkirk twice before breakfast, fighting no less than thirty times. The number of enemy fighters encountered the second time was unprecedented, all Messerschmitt 109s, about a hundred planes. But my squadron was very successful in repelling them. We charged up and down at altitudes from 1,000 to 15,000 feet. When pulling the control stick up after charging down, my senses were blurred, but I knew for sure that I had destroyed four German planes. The results of the other planes in my squadron were also good.</p>
<p>My squadron fought fiercely for half an hour, losing only one plane. One wing of the plane was destroyed, and the pilot landed on Dunkirk beach, injured in the forehead, but still managed to report to headquarters by radio that he had "landed safely." That night, he returned to the country with a team of British soldiers.</p>
<p>The fierce battle ended, and my squadron skirmished with a group of Messerschmitt 110s, shooting down three of them. These German planes descended very quickly. That afternoon, I dived straight down from an altitude of 15,000 feet at a speed of 550 miles per hour, chasing a plane. The German plane sped down, presumably crashing to the ground.</p>
<p>I then used the tail trim adjustment to help, and tried my best to pull back the control stick to ascend. Suddenly, I felt my senses blur again. First, the sunlight turned yellow, then red, gradually becoming a blur. Although I didn't lose consciousness, I couldn't see or hear, but I heard a buzzing sound, louder than the usual motor sound, deafening.</p>
<p>My squadron's bloody battle over Dunkirk was of great benefit. In my opinion, most of the German pilots were mediocre, and their fighting spirit and skills were not high. Although they outnumbered us, they were far inferior to the British planes in terms of quality.</p>

<p>British Ambassador Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Shortened Holiday, Taking a Steamer South, Disembarked at the Great Pier Two Yesterday Afternoon</p>

<p>After the reporter learned of the British Ambassador's arrival in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, he went to the Taikoo Company's pier at about 6 pm to wait.

<p>Customs School, Invaded by Puppet Officials Yesterday</p>
<p>Fortunately, Documents and Equipment Had Been Moved in Advance, Student Admissions Are Invalid</p>
<p>The Customs Vocational School, established by the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, was occupied by people sent by the puppet "Customs Administration" at 10 am the day before yesterday (the 5th). Fortunately, the school had prepared in advance, and all documents and equipment had been moved away, so the puppet side gained nothing. The details obtained by the reporter of Pingming News Agency are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Ordered to Close Early</p>
<p>The Customs Vocational School at No. 12, Mache Road, French Concession, was run by the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance to train customs officers. The position of principal was concurrently held by Zheng Lai, the Director of the Customs Administration. Since the withdrawal of the National Army, Zheng has always been in Shanghai presiding over everything. With painstaking efforts, Zheng left Shanghai a month ago because the environment was getting worse and his life was deeply threatened. Mei, the director of education of the school, has also left. The central government knew that the puppet side would definitely want to get it and be willing to do so, so it ordered the school to close during this summer vacation, and only sent five or six employees to take care of the house. All files were moved to a safe place, so the original plan to recruit new students for this session was also temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Stop Enrolling</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, at 10 am the day before yesterday, Zhang Sumin, the puppet "Director of Customs Administration," suddenly sent four officials to occupy it. At that time, the school staff could not refuse and had to listen to what they did. According to sources from the customs authorities, after the school was occupied by the puppet side, all students who continued to enroll would not be allowed to serve in the customs in the future. It was also heard that Zhang Sumin had notified the French police in advance to "take over" the school on a scheduled date, but the French police ignored it, so the puppet side took possession on its own.</p>
<p>The Trend of the Match Factory Strike Gradually Shows a Glimmer of Hope</p>
<p>The Company's Attitude Turns Harmonious, Asking Yu Qiaqing to Mediate Again</p>
<p>The labor-capital dispute of the British merchant Zilaihuo Company has been going on for two weeks and has not yet been resolved. According to a reporter from Pingming News Agency, the situation seems to be improving since the workers of the new factory met with the management some time ago. Now the management's attitude seems to be gradually softening, and they plan to break the deadlock. Although the management has not yet responded to the workers in the labor-capital negotiations the day before yesterday, according to the news revealed by the company, they plan to ask Yu Qiaqing to mediate again. Everyone believes that Yu's mediation this time will enable the strike to be resolved satisfactorily.</p>
<p>Russian Anti-Communist Leader in Harbin, Not Arrested</p>
<p>Mesla to Be Buried Today</p>
<p>"The English-language Great American Evening News" reports that Mesla, the chairman of the White Russian Overseas Chinese Committee in Shanghai, was assassinated last Friday.

<p>New Hurricane Track</p>
<p>According to the Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry to the Observatory yesterday morning about the new hurricane that has risen in the Pacific Ocean, its progress is very slow. The current location is 17 degrees north latitude and 135 degrees east longitude. The direction has turned due west. The center of the wind is within 120 nautical miles. Its trend is still difficult to understand for the time being.</p>
<p>Shipping Routes to Be Opened Between Shanghai and Vladivostok, Tea Cargo Ships</p>
<p>Chinese tea will be purchased, transported, and sold in a unified manner by state-owned enterprises designated by the government, and will be managed by the China Tea Company. Hong Kong has always been the main place for centralized export. Han Meilai, the Commissioner for Commercial Control of Hong Kong, issued a ban on tea exports, saying, "This Commissioner exercises the powers granted by Article 50 of the 1940 Defense Regulations and promulgates an order with the approval of the Acting Governor, prohibiting the export of tea, except for those with licenses signed by this Commissioner or an official of this Commissioner's office." This will have a great impact on the centralized export of Chinese tea from Hong Kong. It has been found that the tea exported from Hong Kong is mainly destined for the Soviet Union. Before the war, it was transported from the production area to Shanghai and then to Vladivostok. After the war, it was concentrated in Hong Kong and then transported to Vladivostok. A barter contract has also been signed with the Soviet Union. It is heard that the Tea Company has decided on a new transportation method: (1) It will be transported by the China-Soviet highway to the northwest and then to the Soviet Union. (2) The old method of transporting to Shanghai, loading ships, and transporting to Vladivostok will be restored. Now some transport vehicles have been designated on the China-Soviet highway to transport tea. Cargo ships will be opened between Shanghai and Vladivostok. As for the Chinese tea stored in Hong Kong, about 5,000 boxes in total, how to deal with it is being considered.</p>
<p>British Writer in China, Simpson, Suddenly Died in Dalian</p>
<p>Detained by the Japanese Authorities for Two Weeks Before His Death, The British Authorities Have Not Received an Official Report</p>
<p>According to news confirmed by foreigners, Simpson, a well-known British writer who has been living in China for a long time, died suddenly in Dalian at the beginning of last week after being detained by the Japanese authorities for fourteen days. The British officials here said that they did not know anything about this matter, but admitted that they had also heard of this rumor. However, according to sources from Dalian, Simpson's death is well known in Dalian, but most residents dare not talk about it publicly.</p>
<p>Died Shortly After Being Released from Prison</p>
<p>It is said that Simpson had previously received a warning of expulsion from the Japanese authorities, but the "crime" that caused the expulsion warning is unknown. Later, Simpson was not expelled, but was changed to being detained. After being in prison for fourteen days, he was sent to a hospital and died within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Expelled in Harbin</p>
<p>Simpson was well-known in the Far East. Before the "September 18th Incident," he served as an advisor to the Manchukuo government. Later, he published the "Harbin News," a Russian and English newspaper in Harbin. Because it published articles that were unfavorable to the puppet "Manchukuo" authorities, he was banished by the puppet "Manchukuo" authorities to Dalian.</p>
<p>Yesterday Morning, at the Entrance of the Dahua Ballroom, Italian Marines Caused Trouble</p>
<p>Chinese Police Beaten, Fired Gun in Self-Defense</p>
<p>At about 2 am yesterday, four members of the Italian Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai, all dressed in plain clothes, with no ties or shirts, insisted on entering the Dahua Ballroom on Avenue Edward VII. At that time, the guard on duty tried his best to prevent them from entering. The Italian soldiers were furious, and one of them slapped the doorman in the face. The doorman then resisted with a wooden stick. While they were arguing with each other, a Chinese police officer (No. 102) from the French Concession, who was on duty nearby, came to mediate. Unexpectedly, the Italian soldiers beat the Chinese police officer and tried to take his pistol. The police officer saw that the situation was not good, so he fired two shots in self-defense. Unexpectedly, the bullet hit one of the Italian soldiers in the foot. At that time, the Italian soldiers fled in all directions. Only one injured police officer and another person immediately sent the injured person to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The injury was minor and there was no major problem. The other person was detained in the police station, but both were allowed to return to the Italian Barracks on Chengdu Road. The Italian soldiers were guards of the Italian Embassy and did not have a curfew pass.</p>

<p>French Concession Deputy Inspector Killed in His Apartment Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Murderer Knocked on the Door, Fired a Single Shot, Fatal Wound, The Deceased Was Dedicated to Matters Concerning the Japanese Side</p>
<p>At about 8 am yesterday, an assassination case occurred on Terrace Road in the French Concession. The deceased was Paul Yankovsky, Deputy Inspector of the Criminal Department of the French Police Department, who was 50 years old. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Opened the Door to Greet a Guest, Suddenly Shot</p>
<p>At about 7:55 am, Yang was at his private residence at No. 27, Lane 17, Terrace Road, when he suddenly heard someone ringing the doorbell outside. He went to answer the door. Unexpectedly, as soon as the door opened, a thug suddenly shot him, the bullet piercing his throat. Yang fell to the ground in extreme pain. Seeing that his purpose had been achieved, the murderer rode away on his original bicycle. Yang was seriously injured and his breathing was weak. He was rushed to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but he died on the way at about 8 am. A Western woman living next door to Yang at the time witnessed the tragedy from the window of her apartment. She said that a few minutes after the thug fired the shot, Yang immediately fell to the ground in the passageway of his apartment, with blood flowing from his throat.</p>
<p>Fluent in Japanese, Naturalized as French</p>
<p>Yang was a White Russian who became a French citizen. He was born in Vladivostok in 1890. In 1929, he joined the French Concession Police Department. He specialized in matters concerning the Japanese side. All matters related to the Japanese side in the French Police Department were translated into French by him from Japanese. He spoke Japanese fluently. It is said that he specialized in arresting terrorist criminals, and his death may have been because he was too familiar with the background of the recent assassination of Mesla, the chairman of the Russian Overseas Chinese Committee, and had important evidence. Yang was formerly a royal officer in the Imperial Russian era, serving as a lieutenant in the army. After the Russian Revolution in 1917, he joined the French army and served as an air force captain in the First World War. He made special achievements and received an air force medal. After the European war, he served in the French Indochina Defense Forces. Recently, he also served as a lieutenant colonel in the French reserve forces.</p>
<p>Owned Property in Korea, Quite Wealthy</p>
<p>It is said that during the Russian Revolution, the man fled to Chongjin, Korea, where he lived and learned Japanese. Then he traveled to Harbin and other places before coming to Shanghai and joining the Russian Overseas Chinese Team of the French Concession Police Department. Because of his special achievements, he was specially allowed to become a French citizen. Yang's wife is also Russian, and they have a son and a daughter, both in their twenties, who are currently vacationing at the Zhuyi Hot Springs in Korea. It is rumored that the Yang family owns 30,000 mu of land in the hot spring area and is quite friendly with the nearby Japanese and Koreans.</p>
<p>French Concession Mail Examined, Unavoidable</p>
<p>Attention Should Be Paid to Communication</p>
<p>After Japanese inspectors re-entered the Masnan Road Post Office the day before yesterday and seized a large number of mails, the problem of mail inspection in the French Concession has become concrete. All the Japanese inspectors repeated their arrival at the post office yesterday morning and entered the inspection room to continue inspecting the mail they had taken away yesterday. A large part of them were returned. After checking, the post office handed them over to the postmen for delivery. The mail posted at the post office yesterday was still read and selected for inspection. The general situation was exactly the same as that implemented by the Management Bureau. Also, the office hours of the Japanese inspectors have gradually become regular since the day before yesterday, from 8:30 am to 12:00 pm and from 1:30 pm to 5:00 pm. Since then, the freedom of communication for mail posted within the French Concession has also begun to be deprived.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Situation</p>
<p>The Japanese inspectors continued to enter the Masnan Road Post Office at 8:30 am yesterday, but the number of people had been reduced from nine to eight. Three of these inspectors were wearing their own pistols. They then took away more than 100 letters and printed matter, and more than 20 registered letters. It was found that dozens of letters and printed matter and six or seven registered letters were inspected throughout the day yesterday and not returned. It is still unknown whether they will be seized.</p>
<p>Scope of Inspection</p>
<p>The inspection of mail at the Masnan Road Post Office is the same as that implemented by the Management Bureau. Therefore, there is no certainty as to whether the number of inspectors will decrease or increase in the future. The scope of inspection is very wide. In addition to mail, letters in each mailbox and parcels will be unavoidable.</p>
<p>Chongming Massacre Not Over, Has Become a Terrorist Area</p>
<p>The Essence of the County Has Been Turned Into a White Land</p>
<p>Several Places Are Deserted</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Stationed in Chongming, After More Than 100 Japanese Soldiers Were Ambushed by the Chinese Army, In Order to Vent Their Anger, They Implemented an Unprecedented City Slaughter. According to Refugees Who Fled to Shanghai, The Japanese Army Is Still Continuing to Burn Houses and Kill People. From Er Tiao He to Xinkai He, He Xi, Yibei, Rixin Town, Huangmao Two Towns, Shihe Town, Daxin Town, Jiang , Xishi Town, Puzheng Port, Xiaoshi He, and Other Villages and Towns, Tens of Miles Around, Have Been Turned Into Scorched Earth. The Essence of the Whole County Has Been Burned, and More Than 1,000 People Have Been Killed, Including the Puppet "Self-Defense Corps." No One Buried Them. The Japanese Army Burned Them All, So the Stench Was Everywhere, Making People Want to Vomit. As for the Navigation, Although There Are Still Japanese Merchants' Zhejiang Maru and Qingyun Maru Ships Coming and Going (The Docks Are Shanghai, Puzheng Port, Xinqiao Port, Er Tiao He, and Nanmen Port), Now Only a Few Elderly People Go to Shanghai to Visit Their Old Homes or Relatives. Young and Strong People Have Long Disappeared Because They Are Afraid of Being Killed. Also, Because Er Tiao He and Xinqiao Port Are Deserted, They No Longer Stop There.</p>
<p>Since the 4th, the Japanese Army Has Said That Military Needs Are the Reason, and the Traffic Has Been Cut Off From Dongmen to Puzheng Port (a Distance of Fifty Li). There Have Been Several Cases of Residents Being Killed Without Knowing It. Chongming Shanghai Fellow Townsmen's Groups, Because Their Hometowns Have Suffered This Disaster, and No Less Than Six or Seven Thousand Refugees Have Fled to Shanghai, Without Food or Clothing, and Are in a Terrible Situation, Have Launched a Relief and Reception Effort.</p>
<p>Rumor of Suspension of Sale of Tickets to Englishmen, Denied by the Japanese Side</p>
<p>Regarding the rumor that various ships to Japan will suspend the sale of tickets to Englishmen, which the Japanese authorities will implement, the Japanese merchant Dongya Shipping Company, located in the Licha Hotel on the north side of the Waibaidu Bridge, learned that it was not true. It is said that they have not received such a notice from the Japanese authorities, so the Shanghai Maru, which arrived in Shanghai from Japan at 3 pm yesterday, sold tickets to Englishmen as usual. The ship is scheduled to set sail for Japan at 9 am yesterday. It is also rumored that the company may not sell tickets to Englishmen in the future.</p>
<p>Curfew in the Northern District of Hongkou, Temporary Martial Law</p>
<p>In view of the imminent arrival of the anniversary week of the August 13th Shanghai War, the authorities of the two concessions are on strict guard and have increased police patrols to curb all possible unfortunate incidents. The curfew will also be seriously handled and measures will be taken. The curfew time will be from 12:30 am to 5 am. The authorities have adopted this method since the night before. It is heard that on the Hongkou side, the Japanese side also adopts the same method for pedestrians who want to pass through the northern district.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Actively Assists China, Supporting China's War of Resistance</p>
<p>Holding the Same Principles as Fighting for Freedom, Providing Large Loans and a Large Amount of Military Supplies</p>
<p>Words of the London Correspondent of TASS</p>
<p>"The North China Daily News" reports that the London Aid China Committee recently invited Rustan, the London correspondent of the Soviet TASS News Agency, to speak on the Soviet Union's assistance to China in the fight against Japan. When Chairman Yu Ming introduced Rustan to the crowd, he mentioned British Prime Minister Churchill's remarks, saying that Churchill's statement that Britain was determined to fight to the end was the same as the statement made by the Chinese government in December 1937. China was able to see what Britain is doing now, and could not help but recall the early stages of the Chinese war.</p>
<p>Providing a Large Amount of Material Assistance</p>
<p>Rustan continued his speech, saying that in order to seek national independence, the Soviet Union has repeatedly expressed its purpose of supporting China and has provided a large amount of material assistance during the three years of the war of resistance. The Soviet Union's credit loans to China amounted to 60 million pounds sterling, and the US loans to China amounted to 11.25 million pounds sterling, and the British loans amounted to 8 million pounds sterling. After the Chinese delegation first appealed to the League of Nations General Assembly and the civilized countries for assistance, the Soviet Union immediately complied with all its obligations to the League of Nations and responded.</p>
<p>Signing a Non-Aggression Treaty</p>
<p>Since China's last appeal, the Soviet Union has assisted China in other ways and signed a non-aggression treaty. In 1937, China made extremely humble suggestions to the League of Nations and the Beijing Conference, requesting spiritual and material assistance. Only the Soviet Union supported it.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Restrains the Japanese Army in Manchuria</p>
<p>By January 1938, the Soviet Union's supply of military equipment to China had gradually increased, which had attracted the attention of reporters from London newspapers and was recorded. In April of the same year, assistance became more active, causing the Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union to protest, saying that the Soviet Union's move violated its neutrality. The Soviet Union has established a strong Red Army, so that the elite of the Japanese Army cannot be transferred from Manchuria.</p>
<p>Assisting Those Who Fight for Freedom</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has also signed a trade agreement with China, which is the only trade agreement China has signed on a completely equal basis. What is the reason for the Soviet Union's actions? This is the most important point. The world naturally wants to see its explanation. If this explanation is not fully understood, then the Soviet Union's policies will be incomprehensible. It is important to know that one of the basic principles of the Soviet Union is to expect freedom, and people who are willing to fight for freedom cannot use the people of other countries, and must provide the greatest assistance to the people of other countries who are fighting for their freedom. This is the real explanation.</p>
<p>The Principles of Struggle Are Consistent Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>Any people who are ruled by foreigners and still allow the rulers to oppress them, especially the people in colonies and semi-colonies who are oppressed, cannot claim to be fighting for civilization and freedom. The Soviet Union's assistance to China is because it sees that the principles of China's struggle are the same as the principles that the Soviet Union itself holds, and it is not for the sake of seeking material assistance in the future. The world must understand this point, otherwise we will judge Soviet politics and may go astray.</p>
<p>Fiction and Slander Are Smoke Screens</p>
<p>Rumors that Stalin intends to divide China with Japan are intended to make people distrust the Soviet Union. These are actually harmful to China. All kinds of fiction and slander are nothing more than smoke screens to cover people's eyes. The facts are very different, that is, the agreement between Britain and Japan on the disposal of the Tianjin bank deposited by the Chinese government. It is undeniable that the Chinese government was forced to accept this agreement, but it cannot be denied that the Chinese government warmly welcomed it.</p>
<p>Who Is Spreading the Rumors and What Is the Purpose</p>
<p>Because the world may misunderstand the Soviet Union's policy towards China, fiction and slander can be used as smoke screens to conceal compromises that are not a disaster for China, but are ultimately unfavorable to China. In short, we must be careful to prevent the Soviet Union's policy towards China from being misrepresented. If we see misrepresentation, the best way is to investigate who is spreading it and what is the purpose.</p>

<p>Moya Silk Weaving Factory Deputy Director, Mo Rude, Was Kidnapped Yesterday</p>
<p>Four Bandits Appeared in the Downtown Area</p>
<p>Jumped into a Car and Forcibly Took Away the Ransom</p>
<p>Mo Weixin, Courtesy Name Rude, a native of Wuxing, 29 years old, Deputy Director and Shareholder of the East China Management Office of Moya Silk Weaving Factory at No. 207 Tianjin Road, Public Concession, has been working in the factory for about two years. His family rents a house at No. 539 Haige Road, a cross-border road in West Shanghai, because he has some assets and owns a private car, number 218.</p>
<p>Bandits Boarded the Car and Drove Away with the Ransom</p>
<p>At about 12 o'clock noon yesterday, Mo finished his work in the management office and returned to his residence for dinner as usual. He stepped into the No. 228 car at the entrance, driven by the driver A Si. The car had not traveled a few steps before it reached the corner of Tianjin Road and Shanxi Road. Because the street was narrow and there were fruit stalls on both sides of the road, the car was driving very slowly. Suddenly, four bandits in short clothes flashed out from the sidewalk, all holding pistols. Three of the bandits crowded into the car, threatened Mo Rude with guns, and one bandit stepped onto the front of the car and threatened the driver A Si, not allowing him to make a sound, and forcibly drove the car forward. When they reached the Nanjing Road intersection, the traffic police on duty were releasing the red light, and pedestrians and vehicles were prevented from traveling south. The bandit driving the car was anxious to take the ransom and escape, so he ignored everything and made a small turn and drove east along Nanjing Road. At that time, a streetcar was overturned, but fortunately no one was injured.</p>
<p>The Driver Was Also Kidnapped</p>
<p>After the factory learned about it, it reported to the Central Police Station to rescue Mo and track down the bandits. As for the driver A Si, who was kidnapped along with him, he had not been released by 6:30 pm. There was also no news of the discovery of the No. 218 car. Moya Silk Factory is a limited company. Before the Shanghai War, its business was good. Because the silk fabrics produced by the factory were sold well in other places, its business has been declining due to environmental factors and traffic congestion. It is said that Mo's parents both passed away last year, and he also has a younger brother named Ruyi, ) born to his stepmother), who is ten years old and is still studying.</p>
<p>Huangshan Port, Jiangyin, Has Been Opened as a Military Port by the Japanese</p>
<p>Jiangyin is located on the Yangtze River, with many ports and forks. The farmland and water conservancy in the coastal areas all rely on tidal irrigation. Since the three years after the war, the ports along the river, such as Huangshan Port, Shengang Port, Xiagang Port, Ligang Port, and tidal floodgates such as Nanzha Gate and Dingbo Gate, have all been changed. Huangshan Port has been used as a military port by the Japanese and ships are prohibited from sailing. Xiagang Port and Nanzha Gate have been blocked by the Japanese, and 20,000 to 30,000 mu of farmland in the relevant towns and villages have no way to irrigate. Only Huangri Port and Dingbo Gate are as good as ever. Ships and cargo transportation must be "taxed." This time, there has been a drought and little rain, and the fields in the Xixiang area have suffered the most.</p>

<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Bulls Gradually Wavering</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listing price revealed with no change. The black market for British and American exchange rates was sometimes tight and sometimes loose, with an uncertain trend. The afternoon brought news of the withdrawal of ambassadors by both Britain and Japan, which operators generally regarded as negative news, causing speculative bulls to waver and sell.

<h3>Rumors Erupt, Gold Market Retreats Slightly After Closing</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash cooked raw gold black market situation revolved around 5,600 yuan, and confidence remained strong. However, the exchange market's tightness and looseness depended on reports, and the trend was unclear. Buying and selling could offset each other. However, after rumors of the mutual withdrawal of ambassadors by Britain and Japan spread, operators regarded this as negative news, and sellers competed, putting downward pressure on the closing price. The morning opening was 5,570 yuan. After being fiercely sold off by securities firms and money changers, it plummeted to 5,545 yuan. Soon after, gold firms, securities firms, and retail investors all absorbed, and buying sentiment was strong for a time. News of tightening foreign exchange rates pushed the price up to 5,615 yuan. Subsequently, with the return of foreign exchange, many retail investors came out again, immediately falling to 5,570 yuan. Hong Kong gangs had a good appetite and returned to 5,600 yuan before closing. The result was 5,585 yuan. The aftermarket was flat and tired, opening at 5,575 yuan. Thanks to slight picking up by gold firms and securities firms, it rose by several tens of yuan. Ultimately, due to rumors of negative news, the lack of buyers caused it to fall to 5,580 yuan at closing, a slight increase of 5 yuan compared to the previous day. However, it was quite sluggish after closing, at only 5,565 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was two thousand several hundred taels. Gold jewelry shops immediately returned to flat after rising. Customs gold, etc., remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Cooked Raw Still Up 5 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, the initial price per bar (ten taels) was stable and calm due to the flat exchange market. The opening fell slightly by 5 yuan, with silver shops quoting 5,570 yuan per ten taels of gold. Due to the sale by securities firms and money changers, and because the foreign exchange rate was reported to be loose at this time, although Hong Kong gangs picked up slightly in the middle, it was ultimately pushed down by more than 20 yuan. Money changers quoted 5,545 yuan for 20 taels of gold, which was less. Fortunately, gold firms suddenly took advantage of the low price to pick up fiercely, and the market trend turned suddenly. And soon the exchange market suddenly reported a return to softness, causing retail investors to compete to pick up on seeing the scene, and Hong Kong gangs also made purchases, so it went beyond the 5,600 yuan mark for a while. Silver shops sold 30 taels for opportunistic profit, rising to 5,615 yuan. Unfortunately, the good times did not last long, and soon dissipated. A certain money changer released a lot of long positions, and floating long positions followed suit, retreating again to 5,570 yuan. Later, silver shops took advantage of the low price to buy in, and gold firms' buying intentions rekindled, and it rose to 5,600 yuan again. However, as buyers decreased before closing, many retail investors sold off, so the closing was only reported at 5,585 yuan. The opening in the afternoon was a small increase of 10 yuan, with silver shops quoting 5,575 yuan for 30 taels of gold. Subsequently, thanks to the dragging in by cash gold firms and securities firms, it once rose to 5,593 yuan. In the end, due to the selling by money changers and silver shops, the late closing was only 5,580 yuan. The result was an increase of 5 yuan compared to the previous day. However, the underlying trend was weak after closing. Due to rumors on the market that relations between Britain and Japan were deteriorating and that the two countries were withdrawing their ambassadors, it had fallen to 5,565 yuan under the selling pressure from securities firms and silver shops, but there were few transactions. The total fluctuation for the day was 70 yuan. The selling price of cash gold firms' own brand gold was more than 10 yuan higher than the cooked raw gold, and the buying price was 30 yuan lower. The current standard gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there was little trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Immediately Returns to Flat After Rising</p>
<p>Silver jewelry shops initially hung 570 yuan per tael, but at 10 o'clock it was raised by 10 yuan, and at 10:25 it fell back by 10 yuan. As a result, Da Tong Hang still hung 570 yuan. The new shops were similar to the above price, with the buying price reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>American Dollar Notes Fluctuate Irregularly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw cooked raw currency with a firm and stable situation. British and American gold pounds also rose slightly by only 0.5 yuan. The supply and demand for British gold notes were equal, and the market price stood flat. American gold notes fluctuated irregularly. It initially traded at 17.45 yuan, then gradually decreased to 0.8 yuan, then suddenly rose to 0.6 yuan. In the afternoon, it retreated to 17.42 yuan, a decrease of 0.05 yuan. Hong Kong notes followed the high Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate to 3.95 yuan. The demand for Japanese gold notes did not decrease, and the evening market continued to rise to 1.315 yuan. The supply and demand for Korean notes remained even, and the evening market still stood at the original price of 1.095 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Bonds Excited, Land Reclamation Stocks Also See High Prices</h3>
<p>In the securities black market yesterday, the morning rise was the most powerful. In the afternoon, the A and B types of bonds rose even more vigorously. The C and E types had broken through the 50 yuan mark, and the situation was generally good. Market sentiment was gradually interested, but the floating long positions were being cashed in for profit, resulting in a slight pullback. However, the A type has always been exceptionally strong. Because of the special relationship with a certain number, E type stocks were being sold off for profit, so they were uniquely sluggish. The general trend should continue to be optimistic. Yesterday, Wan Chang, Lianyi, and Yongkang, etc. sold A type stocks, but it was not enough to satisfy the appetite of buyers. Songmao, Jiufeng, etc. were in great demand, so the highest price was almost 2 yuan. The E type was sold slightly by Ren Chang and Lian He. After opening in the morning, the C type stocks rose in a straight line to a high of 50.15 yuan. Demand was widespread for a time. Xinfu and Hongda's buying in was not surging. The rising trend was too fierce, attracting selling from Yitai, Lianyi, Hengfu, etc., so it retreated to 50 yuan. In the afternoon, Lemao and Yongkang came to purchase again, reaching 50 yuan again. The D type continued to rise due to the purchase by Shangliuhao. The result of the day's market situation was that, except for the E type, which was uniquely down by 0.05 yuan, the rest continued to rise consistently, by 0.2 to 0.65 yuan. The total transaction volume was over one million yuan. A simple table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading included 100 shares of Bank of China, priced at 64.75 yuan, 10 shares of China National Goods Company, priced at 26 yuan, and 40 shares of Silk Industry Bank, priced at 26.5 yuan. All three transactions were calculated in legal tender. The public industry stock market was quieter yesterday, and the fluctuations were not as great as the previous day. There were still many transactions. The China Land Reclamation stock was extraordinarily active. Because it was rumored that it would issue an interim dividend, the opening price was only 14.7 yuan, then it gradually rose to a high price of 15.8 yuan, and closed at 15.5 yuan, with a transaction volume of 111,000 shares. The rest of the market situation did not have major fluctuations, and seemed to be awaiting a more definite change in the situation.</p>
<p>London, 5th (Monday): Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign bonds and Far Eastern British merchant companies' stocks were generally flat, with only the rubber stocks of Great Lakling falling uniquely by 1 shilling 3 pence, priced at 13 shillings 9 pence, and the rest unchanged.</p>
<h3>Financial Commentary (Continued) (5) (Day)</h3>
<p>— Sheng Kai</p>
<p>Because the regulations stipulated that import and export merchants should enjoy the exchange rate difference and pay the balance fee according to the legal price and the Chinese Exchange listed price, I personally wrote an article on July 5, 1939, discussing the size of the commercial exchange rate. However, the listed prices of the two Chinese banks have been pegged at 7 pence for the British exchange rate, 13.625 yuan for the US exchange rate, and 2.145 yuan for the Hong Kong exchange rate since they were listed, and they have been pegged at this level for various reasons until the end of July of this year, without any changes. When the 7 pence stipulated in July 1939 was very close to the black market exchange rate. In June 1939, the black market was 6 and 7/8 pence, and it was lower than the black market. The average number from January to June 1939 was 7 and 13/16 pence, so 7 pence was very appropriate. Since the beginning of this year, the black market exchange rate has gone from tight to soft and then greatly shrunk on May 2. Since the recovery on May 10, the British gold has hovered within 4 pence and the US gold has fluctuated around 6 yuan until the end of July, which is too different from the commercial exchange rate set last year. Calculated at an average of 4.1615 pence for the British exchange in the first half of 1940, the difference reached 68%. As for the average US exchange rate of 6.3995 yuan, the difference with 13.625 yuan as of August 3 was 113%. This is because the 13.625 yuan set by the arbitrage calculation was based on the market price of 4.68 yuan for the pound sterling. Later, the free pound sterling in the New York market was produced, and the Shanghai exchange market followed the US dollar, so the difference was particularly large. From this point of view, the commercial exchange rate really should have been revised long ago. This new setting of 4 and a half pence is really not surprising, not to mention that the commercial exchange rate can be large or small. At the same time, according to the effective foreign exchange and trade control measures currently implemented by the Chinese government, the Central Bank is still maintaining the statutory exchange rate, importers still have to pay the balance fee, and exporters still get to enjoy the exchange rate difference.</p>
<p>After the commercial exchange rate was changed to 4 and a half pence for British gold, the US and Hong Kong exchange rates of course changed accordingly. However, does the so-called market exchange rate of the pound sterling refer to the free pound price in the New York market or the statutory pound price in London? If calculated according to the statutory pound price of 4.02, the US exchange rate will be set at 7.5375 and will not change every day. If calculated according to the free pound price, it will change every day. If calculated according to the closing price of 3.835 yuan for the pound sterling in the New York market on July 31, the US exchange rate should be 7.190625. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, calculated according to 1 shilling and 3 and 1/32 pence to the British pound, 1 Hong Kong dollar should be equal to 3.34 yuan. Therefore, although the commercial exchange rate will be higher than the black market exchange rate in the future, it is very close. Compared with the average number in the first half of 1940, the difference is only from 7% to 13%.</p>
<p>In addition, the biggest reason for changing the commercial exchange rate is to strive to collect foreign exchange funds and encourage the export of local goods. Because the black market exchange rate of legal tender in the past was far lower than the commercial exchange rate, merchants could not make a profit from shipping goods for foreign exchange settlement, and they would suffer losses. Therefore, most of them stopped operating or hoarded goods for speculation without exporting them for the time being. Cunning merchants smuggled goods to Hankou for export, which affected production and made it impossible for export trade to progress, reducing the country's foreign exchange income. China's supreme commander recently declared that in the fourth year of the war of resistance, military efforts accounted for only 30%, while economic efforts should account for 70%. This shows the importance of economic warfare, and striving to collect foreign exchange funds and encouraging the export of local goods are the main weapons of economic warfare. Therefore, it is necessary to change the commercial exchange rate in order to achieve the goals of economic warfare. (End)</p>
<h3>Yarn Flowers: Yarn Market Hovers Outside 1,000 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>The yarn market is stable, and the trend is again a hovering situation. This is because the actual sales to out-of-town customers do not see a large development, and at the same time, the foreign exchange rate is seen to be stable, so people's hearts are quiet and the rising trend has subsided again. However, the footing is very stable. If there are no unexpected changes, it is still a fundamental problem of entering and exiting the market. It is still the obstruction of the transportation lines. Therefore, it has stopped rising and is hovering outside the 1,000 yuan mark.</p>
<p>The yarn market opened this morning with tight sentiment, but not as tight as the afternoon market of the previous day, because the foreign exchange rate did not shrink but was rather loose. Therefore, buyers were not surging. The price of 20-count Shuangma was 1,020 yuan. After a while, those who grabbed overnight caps, seeing the poor environment, poured out one after another, falling to 1,012 yuan. Then, a certain company dragged in, and it rose back to 1,019 yuan. The closing was slightly tired. The transaction statistics for half a day show 2,140 packages. The market for 10-count Shuangma rose by 9 yuan. There were 330 pieces of cotton yarn today, and another 105 pieces of cotton cloth, shipped to Xiamen. There were 130 pieces of cotton cloth and 185 pieces of cotton yarn shipped to Hong Kong. The amount bought by each gang is listed as follows: Same trade 1,460, Hong Kong 320, Wenzhou 20, Mainland 340. Statistics 2,140</p>
<h3>Difficult to Expect Revival in Cotton Sales</h3>
<p>The situation of local cotton is again on a flat path. This is because foreign cotton has returned to looseness, the overseas cotton market is sluggish, domestic yarn sales are not smooth, and yarn prices are not rising significantly, so people's hearts have become tired again. Fire engine cotton is at 151 yuan, Indian cotton at 100 yuan. Several hundred pieces were transacted. It is said that the factory's absorption has not been very prosperous.</p>
<p>According to another report, foreign cotton market prices are rather sluggish in the New York cotton market. All parties are taking a cautious attitude. As a result, closing prices fell by 1-2 pounds from the previous day. Indian cotton saw both rises and falls yesterday, with fluctuations of one rupee.</p>
<p>The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai Port was slightly active yesterday, but only with Japanese manufacturers, while Chinese factories were still unusually quiet. Yesterday, the amount sold by the same trade to Japanese factories was more than 1,000 packages, but all were for one month's credit. According to the current situation, foreign cotton transactions will loosen again, because it is widely rumored that Japanese ships have stopped carrying British passengers and transporting Indian cotton.</p>
<p>The American cotton ship Tampa, loaded with 600 pieces, arrived in Shanghai on the 3rd of this month and stopped at the Hongkou Huashun Wharf to unload.</p>
<h3>Food: Foreign Rice Immediately Tires After Rising</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice was still in a situation of first tight and then tired. At the beginning of the morning, floating hoarders and retail investors searched and grabbed in a big way. Local shop owners and general actual sales also did not distinguish between black and white and followed. Therefore, the seller's shouts arose, and the market price rose step by step, returning to the previous day's high. But once the price was raised, speculators used their tricks of capturing and releasing again. They mostly came out in large numbers at high prices, and the market was filled with goods, startling local merchants who retreated and did not enter. At this point, the sales market gradually declined, the market color returned to tired, and the price fell back. By the closing, it was half a yuan or so shorter than the previous market's closing price. If No. 1 Chen Saigon was only 58.5 yuan, and No. 2 was 53.5 yuan. However, as the international situation slightly eased and the foreign exchange rate was also seen to loosen, speculators had no way to use their manipulation tricks. Those who profited sold off quickly, and those hoarding goods also did not want to hold them for a long time, so the market fell step by step. No. 2 Siamese rice initially increased by 0.5 yuan to 63 yuan, then decreased from 62.6 yuan to 62 yuan. The opening price of No. 2 Saigon was lowered to 62 yuan, all 1.5 yuan lower than the previous day. Saigon mixed broken rice fell to 50.5 yuan in the face of the cargo party's urgent release and the waiting of the entering households, which was 2 yuan less than the previous day's 53.5 yuan. The number of transactions totaled less than 200 tons. There were also only 2,500-600 packages of current rice.</p>
<p>Jing and Guomi fluctuated irregularly yesterday with the fluctuations of Siamese rice in the dark market trading. The result was still flat, similar to the previous market, with no gains or losses. Changbang fresh Qingjing was 68-69 yuan, Xiqingjing was 67.2 yuan, 67 yuan, Changzhou Sukunjing was 65-66 yuan, and the next best was 62-63 yuan, Subodao was 62-63 yuan, Nangang special early rice was 65, and rice was around 61 yuan. Jinli special Yuan was 61-62 yuan, and Changdan Baiyuan was around 60 yuan, Hong Kong Baiyuan was 61-62 yuan.</p>
<p>Since the new Zhou Pei rice was put on the market with 25 dan the day before yesterday, the factory goods suddenly did not continue yesterday. Only 6 dan was transferred from the South City, and the price was raised by 0.5 yuan, opening at 62.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Uneven Flour Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market situation was slightly uneven. The market price of this factory's flour stood at the original price of 15 yuan, with no changes. The number of factory shipments was still 5,000-6,000 packages, all handled by the Mujiang Street gang. However, inland flour such as Jinshan Shuangshi and other brands has successively been shipped to Shanghai, priced at only 14.2-3 yuan. Therefore, the Japanese factory's flour, the Phoenix brand, was also loose. Yesterday's opening price for this month was 14.2 yuan, and September was 14.5-4.5 yuan, which was 0.2-3 yuan less than the previous time. It is heard that the returned goods are still depreciating. As for foreign flour, the selling price was rather expensive because there were customers asking about it, such as foreign fortress Shuangying brand, etc. The previous opening price was 15.6-7 yuan, and yesterday's asking price was 16 yuan, so the market was uneven.</p>
<p>Wheat: There was still little change in yesterday's wheat market, because there was not much arrival in the past few days. Travelers and wheat holders uniformly held on, and Japanese factories' intake was not greedy. Chinese factories found it more difficult to sell smoothly, resulting in a continued quiet market. It is heard that the Japanese factory's intake price was around 20 yuan, and the Chinese factory's purchase price needed to add 1.5-2 yuan. The total number of those who directly delivered to the factory was only about 3,000 packages. Today, there are 100 packages of wheat being shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Oilcake: Soybean Cake Sells Well Domestically, Selling Price Suddenly Rises by 0.4-0.5 Yuan. Little Excitement in Raw Soybean Oil Trading.</h3>
<p>Soybean Oil: Yesterday's oil market all stuck to the original price. Although the overall situation was that the origin was raised by German merchants (mistakenly published as French merchants yesterday) taking care of it, which affected the Shanghai market, the Shanghai inventory could still cope with current sales, so the footing was still firm. However, buying and selling were less exciting. A total of 250 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were transacted. The price is detailed in the market price column. 50 pieces of Yantai raw oil and 200 cans of canned oil, 1,500 cans of canned raw oil from Jiangbei local workshop, 250 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil, 50 pieces of Qingqi soybean oil, 140 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, and 100 dan of Daya factory oil. The destinations were Jiangbei raw oil handled by Hong Kong gang, Dalian beans taken by domestic [?], and the rest were all taken by Xing [?] Benjie. Today, there are 1,200 cans of raw oil being shipped to Hong Kong, and another 760 cans being shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<p>Soybean Cake: Although the number of transactions was not high, most of them were actual sales in inland markets. Therefore, under the underlying trend of declining supply, its rising trend was suddenly strong. As a result, it rose by 0.4-0.5 yuan compared to the previous market. It is estimated that 1,600-700 pieces of Shengji cake were at a price of 11.4-7 yuan. 200 pieces of Qingzhong cake were at a price of 10.08 yuan. Two cars of Yuanlong cake were at a price of 11.1-2 yuan. Today, there are 6,400 pieces of soybean cake being shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend in the sugar market turned to stability, with only a few jiao in ups and downs. The current goods of the association's marked plate were 70.5 yuan for No. 24 crude white sugar from this store and 70.02-70 yuan for foreign store goods. The transfer goods for delivery on August 15 were 55.5-55.2 yuan. Dutch cotton white sugar was 70.7 yuan, Dutch red sugar was 57 yuan, Taikoo white B brand was 73 yuan, DY brand was 70.5 yuan, and HX brand was 70.2 yuan. For domestic sugar, Guangbang opened more than 200 packages of Dongxiang red sugar, with the higher ones at 52.5 yuan and the next best at 51.5 yuan, also [?].</p>
