<p>社評</p>
<h3>願泰國自重</h3>
<p>旬日以前，日文對於緬甸公路的開通，曾經發爲恫嚇論調，謂英如重開該路，必將促成世界大戰的爆發；現在該路之即將開放，已因日本對英美所採取攻勢而成既定事實；至於世界大戰之是否會因此而立即爆發，則業於近日日本當局態度中獲得否定的答案。是以日前重慶方面所推測，曾有過日本於此如無對策則現閣將難免倒臺的見解。這一見解，猶謂日本當局將不管爲了利害抑或顏面，總是不免要採取某種對策；其最輕而易舉的，殆將爲日方業已公開聲明的轟炸；此外據昨日維希消息，傳聞日方更將利用泰國在該路開通之前，造成「紛亂事件」，並以泰國爲攻擊滇緬路交通的根據地。泰當局並表示有與三國同盟共同合作的企圖。日本佔有越北而後，南進的第二個目標當無過於泰國；如果此際能利用擾亂滇緬路爲口實而在泰國攫取根據地，並使泰國入彀，為計之得，誠無以過此。所不解者，只是泰國當局何苦甘受他人利用？當日前法日兩國進行談判越南問題的同時，泰國也乘機對越南要索土地，擾攘多日，最近始以組織混合代表團暫告段落；這在泰國，雖已形成客觀上的幫兇，但也未始沒有收復失地做理由；至於上述傳說，則無異以國運爲孤注，而從事於國際冒險的重大賭博。</p>
<p>泰國之於日本，究將援助到何等程度，尚須待事實爲之證明，但可斷言其重要性絕不在對華而在英緬。因爲華泰既不接壤，泰國境內的機場距離滇省也比河內勞開等地更遠，是以對於侵擾滇省，日本並不能從暹境獲得何等便利。而另一方面，如用以窺伺英　根據地，則泰國正具有重大價値。緬甸首府仰光距離泰緬邊境不遠，最易蒙受來自泰境的威脅；同時，克拉地峽既爲印度洋東岸心腹之患，而暹羅半島的南端又直拊馬來半島的後背，可使新加坡要塞背腹受敵；倘若由強力變更現狀，自然絕非英國以至美方所能坐視或容忍。而在泰國方面，究以何等代價或條件爲交換，纔輕身投入於冒絕大危險的國際漩渦當中；且不惜放棄其多年一貫的中立政策而左袒日本，以與英美爲敵，實爲一絕大的疑問。</p>
<p>泰國是南亞僅存的一個獨立國家，其多年力爭上游的奮鬥亦頗爲世人所同情；但自武人柄政以來，既乏眼光，又無定見，一味頷鶩近利，羨强凌弱，對於侵略國家則力求依附，於苦鬥求存的鄰幫則多方中傷，其外交政策雖似多方面從事運用，但卻隱以對日以至德義關係為重心；這種情形，已對泰國前途畫成一幅黯淡的遠景。故目前所傳參加三國同盟以至爲侵略者作倀之舉，正未始不無可能。其最近乘法越之危，威脅索圭，既頗爲公認所不直，若再進而與侵略軸心深相結合，其存心殆益非常情所能理解。美國對泰予以維持現狀的照會以及限制運泰軍火，已提供了初步警告：　如其愈益倒行逆施，則必不免遭遇更大的國際重壓。況且泰國處境在兩大之間，比較起來，自以來自英屬印緬方面的壓力更爲直接近捷；日本縱已在越北獲得據點，那除卻遂行其自身擴展企圖而外，未必能對泰予以有效的支援。至於德義義之於泰國，更屬鞭長莫及。如此而欲速結不可待的與國，觸犯近在咫尺的强鄰，誠恐英日尚加入三國同盟同爲有百害而無一利，但以泰國自身處境而言，則顯較日本更爲拙劣。</p>
<p>在這日趨尖銳的國際對峙局面當中，弱小國家唯一自保之道只有堅定沈着，守正不阿，即使遭遇橫逆，尚不患無以自存，有如瑞土，即其顯影例。如果不度德，不量力，妄思依附強梁，分取餕餘，且其所引爲與國者更屬一向以罔顧信義著稱的國家，這實無以異於踐薄冰，履虎尾，正是一種極端愚蠢的冒險。有如波蘭與羅馬尼亞即因對外政策之缺乏定見，且向與侵略者深相結納，終致陷於無從振拔，這些覆轍，都値得今日泰國做爲借鑑。</p>
<p>小民族的共同立場講，則泰國絕無關係，如果從東方弱小民族的共同立場講，則泰國無寗應該贊助滇緬路的開放，因爲中國的利益，同時也就是東方弱小民族的共同利益，泰國並不能自外於此。如果此日的泰方當局尚缺乏此種認識與覺悟，那么，至低限度，亦望其能以關切滇緬路者轉而注意其自身國運的前途。</p>

<h3>美領署將續發通知　勸婦孺儘先撤退　本埠日僑情緒至感不寗　美國亟應擴大經濟制裁</h3>
<p>美國爲解除日本威脅、除與英海軍進行密切合作、加强其遠東艦隊外、並防止遠東可能事變、已下令撤退遠東無任務及職業之美僑男子與美僑婦孺、在上海及華北之美海軍眷屬、亦在撤退之例、茲據平明社記者昨向美海軍之關係方面探悉、本埠美海軍重要軍事長官之眷屬、如駐滬防軍司令貝克上校之夫人等、已定於下月七日、乘美郵船公司之柯立芝總統號輪離滬回美、</p>
<p>二次通知　日內發出</p>
<p>本埠美領署於上週發出通知勸令無任務之美僑男子與婦孺撤退後、居住虹口區域內之美僑、已紛向美領署登記、漸决撤退、茲悉、美領署將於下週內發出第二次通知、勸令在滬之所有美僑婦孺、一律撤退、惟在滬有事業及任務之美僑男子、尙不在撒退之列、美國駐滬防軍、目前亦不撤退、</p>
<p>商行補助　職員資斧</p>
<p>本埠美國僑民大部已接獲美領署之準備撤退通知、一小部則因住址不明、尙未能卽行送達、至本埠美國重要商行、亦確已接獲美國總行之通知、勸吿各行職員、撤退職員家屬、並補助其川資、此項通知之內容、聞與美孚總行所發出者相同、關於船隻方面、甚爲缺乏、則美國郵船公司已奉令遣派美國商船中最大之華盛頓號及曼海頓號二郵船前來遠東、協助載運撒退之美　返國、</p>
<p>本埠日僑　大起恐慌</p>
<p>據外商方面所知、本埠日僑對於美國現採堅强立塲、至爲恐慌、其中允以日本商人爲甚、蓋彼等亦有自知之明、若干日僑對於中日戰事前途、極感困難、美日戰事如果爆發、日本前途、實不堪設想、日僑此種恐慌情緒、在含有國際性若干機關中之日籍人員中、亦極瀰漫、</p>
<p>欲定歐局　先決遠東</p>
<p>自美政府在最近數日中、採取堅强立塲之具體行動後、日方官塲態度、已趨軟化、說者以爲時局或已趨向緩和、但此在若干傾向於民治國之外國外交界人員中仍不甚樂觀、據某外國外交界人員之觀察、日本必與德義勾結到底、否則其外交益陷於孤立、但如與德義勾結、是不能不爲德義張目聲援、而與英美對立、日前日方態度之突趨軟化者、花靜待柏林與羅馬之表示、且照現實整個局勢、英美欲穩定歐洲局勢、必須先行擊倒軸心國中最弱一環之日本、而後再對付歐洲、最爲上策、</p>
<p>日本國防　仰賴美國</p>
<p>記者曾以美國對日經濟制裁所可產生之效力、叩詢某經濟權威者、據稱、美國對日禁運、此時實爲千載一時之良機、蓋歐戰發生後、日本所需要之國防及重工業品、已完全仰賴美國供給、所有飛機配件·軍械·車輛·機器·余屬品等品、在戰前尙可自德輸入一部份、開戰以後、來源斷絕、設美國禁止輸出、日本之國防設備及工業建設、立受打擊、</p>
<p>安定世界　偉大力量</p>
<p>美國資源蘊藏之豐富、固屬得天獨厚、而人民創作能力、毫不遜於日耳曼民族、故其人力物力、世罕其匹、加以南美之天然富源、足爲美國所用、故具有安定世界之偉大力量、決非過甚其詞、美國煤汽油產量、佔世界百分之六十、鐵沙·鐵塊·鋼·銅·鋅·鋁·等重要原料、美國出產、均佔世界之第一位、車輛及飛機之製造、亦較德國爲優、</p>
<p>經濟制裁　最佳機會</p>
<p>日本對美前倨後恭、完全因其怵於美國之人力物力、其虛聲恫嚇、蓋認美國未必肯流血也、故望美國朝野知己知彼、毅然實行經濟制裁、勿爲虛聲所懾、蓋制裁實行愈早、海軍流血之機會愈少、而太平洋亦早得太平也、</p>
<h3>象山港外日軍　登陸不逞　開砲二百餘發　並用機槍掃射</h3>
<p>浙省旅滬團體昨接浙東電吿如下、（一）十二日上午十時三十分、象山港橫山洋面停泊之日艦五艘、突向岸猛開砲四十餘發、至五時四十五分、日艦二艘突駛進湖頭渡洋面停泊、無異動、（二）橫山洋面日艦一艘、於下午一時五十六分、放下小汽艇三艘、在海面往返游弋、並向橫山以機槍掃射、至二時十二分、該艇始竄回原艦、（三）十二日下午四時二十分、橫山洋面之日艦突向岸盲當開砲二百四十餘發、計落湖頭渡四枚、被毀房屋四間、大蛟岸落三枚、毀屋五間、橫山××附近落二彈、無損失、餘盡落荒沙塗、（四）停泊龍山洋面日艦、於中午十二時三十六分、向龍山沿岸開砲十七發、彈落灘　沙塗、無損失、</p>
<h3>法捕房對水電工潮　將再調解　引擎間工作　決不致停頓</h3>
<p>法商水電公司工潮、自前日公共交通父停頓後、法捕房政事部因此工潮之僵持、與社會治安及市面繁榮有深切關係、現聞將再度進行調解、擬邀勞資雙方於日內舉行談判、聞罷工工人於前日下午在南市某處集議後、除堅持原提之十六項及新增之二項條件外、復增加臨時短工辭職時由資方發給遣散費半月、及星期假日工資照給之條件、聞資方對於增加米貼一層、曾表示車務處可獲與機務處相同之待遇、惟目下勞方所堅持之十六項條件內容、與機務處之利益、並無關係、昨因星期日例假、勞方未派代表晋謁政事部當局、亦未舉行會議、又悉、水電公司目下參加罷工之部份、爲車務部·機務部·引擎間·三部、而電氣部及自來水部之工人、則仍照常工作、且資方復僱用白俄工人五十餘人、充引擎間工作、一切均有準備、故法租界內之水電供給、決不致中斷、昨日呂班路水電公司總廠之戒備、仍極嚴重、</p>
<h3>滇緬路開放有期　滬商歡欣鼓舞　滬貨內銷活躍可立而待　對防範轟炸有妥愼辦法　寄西南由郵件已決定取道仰光</h3>
<p>滇緬公路自七月中旬爲英方臨時封鎖後、迄今已達三月、本月十七日卽屆期滿、英政府決定於十八日重行開放、中外各界允其商人、聞訊俱爲鼓舞、日方雖多方阻撓與抗議、終不能動搖英政府當局堅毅之信心、某實業家談、自日軍封鎖滇越路後、繼之江浙沿海口岸、亦决第封鎖、使中國對外貿易與對內運輸、不無蒙受若干影響、但轉瞬滇緬路卽可開放、對英美各種原料及軍火之輸出與輸入、均可由此綫轉運、而本埠對運往川滇黔桂等省之貨物、亦可由此路輾轉輸送、不受限制故此路之開放、甚屬重要、</p>
<p>愼防　轟炸</p>
<p>日軍自進入越南後、卽佔領各建築及重要飛機塲、爲空軍之根據地、對開放後之緬甸公路之轟炸與破壞、自在意中、政府已有妥愼辦法、計議及此、照以前廣九那漢等鐵路隨炸隨修之成績觀之、亦無鉅大損失、蓋路工員司、長川駐守全路、一受轟炸、立卽出發修理、決不致因路面之破壞而停駛車輛也、</p>
<p>越貨　退港</p>
<p>氏父談及物品之內銷情形、謂自滬越及沿海各口岸被封鎖後、貨物內銷幾完全絕跡、滬港交通雖仍暢通、而港防交通則時斷時續、本埠貨物雖能運港、惟到達香港後、能否轉運、則成問題、最近越南政府已允將輸入時堆留越境貨物、退至香港、實為工商界日夜所企望者、因中法前雖訂有條約、對運往國外或內地各貨、經由越南轉口者、一概放行、而不再扣留、惟駐彼處之中國外交官署、早已撤退、致不能就地交涉、今因外交部之抗議而獲越政府之允許、實商民之大幸也、</p>
<p>經緬　郵綫</p>
<p>自滇緬路定本月十八日重行開放後、上海郵局奉總局電吿、決將寄往西南郵件、取道該綫運輸、由仰光入口、經滇緬路運往內地、嗣　郵遞　率、當可較前增高、至航空郵件、則仍裝輸至香港後、冉轉載飛機運往、叉自越南發生戰事後、曾有郵包三萬餘件、滯積海防、現郵政總局正在向越南政府交涉放行、一部業已搶運離越、</p>
<p>滬貨　起運</p>
<p>滇緬路定於本月十八日軍行開啟後、本埠進出口商行、紛船積極準備、將　積上海·香港·海防三地貨物、取道該綫運往內地、近日開港之神愛·濟南·海綏·及昨晨啟椗之慶元等各輪、載貨均極擁擠、多係外商輸入商品、轉港待機、經滇緬路綫運入、故整個貨運、已漸呈活躍氣象、</p>
<h3>儲滙局定年內　構儲蓄綱</h3>
<p>郵政儲金滙業局、辦理滙業務、經近年來之努力、已具有相當成績、辦理儲滙之局所、現計千　處、但與全國郵局總數三千餘處相較、僅及三分之一、茲國府爲迅速普及金融網、加緊推行節約建國儲蓄起見、持令交通部於年內　各地郵局以及有吸收存款可能之郵政代辦所一律開辦儲蓄業務、以吸收民間遊資、充裕抗建力量、並在短期內招攷郵儲人員至少一千名、分派各地服務、至辦理手續、允規定應適應當地習慣、及便利儲戶爲主、現正由儲滙局積極辦理中、俾如期於年內完成全國儲滙網、</p>
<h3>銀錢業資金內移　決與四行合作　先在內地儘量添設分行　對滬巿放款已特別審愼</h3>
<p>上海各銀行錢莊存款激增後、各行莊鑒於减低存息不能解決目前之危機、爲避免坐耗利息起見、乃選擇最可靠之抵押品、予以相當之放款、同時對準備始終保持存款總額百分之五十五、因上海正當投資之途徑異常缺乏、以致資金之運用問題日趨嚴重、造成空前投機事業之猖獗、經各行莊一再考慮之後、將過剩之資金、移入西南西北內地、並與中中交農四行台力合作、完成建設和開潑內地之使命、間接杜絕上海各暗市之投機、</p>
<p>內移　用度</p>
<p>關於西南與西北各地之金融、向少爲人注意、自當局對於交通方面着着進行、公路鐵路相繼完成後、工商百業日趨繁盛、當局對投資於內地、予以種種便利、因此上海各大商業銀行、竭力在內地添設分支行處、儘量向內地謀發展、（一）投資開墾土地興修水利發展農業、（二）投資國防生產及開發礦業、（三）投資公共交通事業、（四）投資有關經濟建設事業、（五）投資聯合產銷事業、</p>
<p>準備　加厚</p>
<p>對於上海租界區域以內各項工商業貸款、各行莊均已决定原則、信用放款固非具時、除錢莊對老客戶酌望貸放外、銀行則予完全拒絕承做大宗商品押款、又恐社會指摘、蒙資助囤積操縱之嫌、所以對商品之押款、極端審愼甄別、必視其用途正常爲標準、務使一方不爲社會所誤會、一方又不悖扶助工商業之旨、惟以在此抗戰時期、爲適合環境起見、特厚準備、以便應付、</p>

<h3>英籍副督察長　辭職為國宣勞　定十四日赴馬來亞投軍　捕房警員設筵贈紀念品</h3>
<p>大陸報云、新閘路捕房英籍副督察長高爾特供職工部局警務處已十四載、頗著勞績、頃已辭職、定本月十四日携眷離滬赴馬來亞投軍、爲國宣勞、新閘路捕房警員昨（十二日）午在該捕房舉行私人性質之集會、爲之餞行、贈以手錶等禮品三件、並籌募款項、捐助英國戰爭基金、按高爾特前會服役英陸軍、一九二六年七月入工部局警務處供職刑事科與政治科、一度亦曾負責警務處情報事宜、</p>
<h3>英美採取强硬政策後　遠東形勢轉和緩　英籍評論家伍德海之言論</h3>
<p>英籍評論家伍德海在英文大美周報，關於遠東形勢加以評論云：上周爲遠東最緊張之一周，其原因自由於近衛及松岡對美之談話，日本實際上已通吿美國，美國除非停止援助中國，不反對「大亞洲新秩序」及與日合作造成新秩序外，日本祗有從事戰爭，別無其他途徑可循，當美國選舉運動最緊張時，日木此項威脅之目的，乃在使美國意見分岐，而無決策，美政府毫不爲此項威脅所震驚，準備　付日本最後一着，禁運在增加中，海軍後備兵亦在召集中，美國艦隊及夏威夷駐軍在充實中，同時在遠東無重要任務之僑民，亦勸吿自中日及越南撤退，由美國官方及報界評論之態度，已極顯然。</p>
<p>虛聲恫嚇　完全失敗</p>
<p>美國對因日本之要求而改變其政策，乃認爲無可容忍之汚辱，美國對近衛·松岡·之威脅，及英國通吿開放滇緬路，對於日本，實有鎭靜作用，日本報界之咆哮態度，業已大减，而外務省之釋解，亦在减輕此項危機之趨嚴重，日本所驚異者，乃美國對東京之威脅以輕易　之，雖此事如何，尙未可樂觀，但在著者草此文時，日美間立卽發生戰爭危險，雖米完全解除，可謂巳較緩和，卽對英開放滇緬路之挑釁，亦不致發生嚴　衝突，除非若干不負責之日本飛行員，誤認香港緬甸爲中國領土，或英美郵船爲演習射擊之靶的。</p>
<p>歐洲諸小　國之刦運</p>
<p>至若歐洲軍事　動，雙方仍祇限於空襲，英德雙方皆未解決如何對付夜襲問題，但英皇家空軍業已將其注意力集於軍事目標，不斷對德國海口，飛機塲侵略之根據地，火油廠，兵工廠，鐵路中心等，予以極大損害。而英皇家空軍之光顧柏林，已足使德國府從速撤退兒童之舉，軸心國對巴爾幹之陰謀，究至若干程度，當待於事實證明。德義兩國爲獲羅馬尼亞人民之同情，而使其國家解體。現又以軍事佔領其殘餘領土，來表示其友好。歐洲新秩序決不顧惜小國之權利與主張，此等國家在軸心勢力下，被鞭策而享受「新自由」，中國業已受法國之出賣，而在昆明遭受破壞甚烈之空襲，如法國人民知乎昆明華人團體贈與貝當上將紙傘附函中之簡潔辭句，謂：「日本業已轟炸雲南各城市，感謝閣下之仁慈，中國古語有云：「未雨綢繆」，故特贈送一中國紙傘予閣下」，不知法國人民，對此究作何感想？</p>

<h3>「五二」以來上海匯市的變動及其特徵</h3>
<p>— 史亦聞</p>
<p>國軍西撤之後，政府在上海方面無法行使政權，對上海的金融控制力亦因以减弱。二十七年三月，政府實行外匯管理，保衛中國戰時金融，終以租界情形特殊，未能取締暗市投機活動，中央銀行的外匯統制買賣制度，亦無法維持；官定滙價，僅存形式，實際支配匯市者，全爲暗市行市。自後匯市益復無統制，行市波動劇烈，而買賣外匯者亦都志在投機牟利。這種情形，對於整個戰時經濟，當然極爲不利。但自「五二」以後，情形似有轉變，行市雖然還是有起伏，因政府維持法幣政策的成功，投機家對匯市的壓力已大爲减少，所以一般的說來，「五二」後的匯市要比過法來得平穩。以下且就「五二」後及最近滙市變動情形和若干比較特殊的問題來討論。</p>
<p>「五二」後匯市的變動</p>
<p>「五二」外匯某金會的再度停五供售外匯，本來是政府的一種經濟防禦戰略；共目的一方在打擊日人的經濟攻勢（以戰養戰養政策）一方在打擊以國家民族利益爲犧牲的投機活動。當時我們也曾經這樣指述，可是投機家並不作如是觀，猶因襲他們往日的經騐，以爲戰事愈延長，法幣匯値愈下跌；因此，當時行市儘管已緊得可觀，他們的扒吸工作還是非常起勁。但結果，他們是失敗了，不到三個星期，匯値又回復到「五二」前的水準。先前投機家終是賺得的多虧的少，惟有這次，才受到慘重的打擊，傾家蕩產者有之，失蹤自殺者有之。這一風潮，還波及到其他投機市塲，整個上海市面，也因此衰落下來。</p>
<p>「五二」以後，上海各種投機市塲是蕭條得很，匯市也很少變動。至七月初，政府爲爭取淪陷區與自由區的物資出口權，把商業匯率改訂爲四辦士半（原爲七辦士）。這一措施，顯然與「五二」的停售外滙意義同，是一種經濟防禦戰的另一戰略，可是創痛未痊的投機家，父認爲是一個活動的機會，於是競和購扒，結果匯値被拉低至五元半左右（六月底爲六元左右），其後（八月中句）又因滇越。滇緬兩路的封鎖，與英軍撤防及日軍對越威脅等等問題，市塲上又形成一種恐慌心理，匯値又降近五元關邊。在九月上旬，雖略回升，但　勢還是盤旋，人心依然看緊；直至九月底，中美借款成功，才飛長至五元半關外。（投機家又受重大打擊。）</p>
<p>這次匯市之突然飛長，主要原因當然在中美借款成功。但是，我們須在這裹指出的：促使這次匯市飛長的實際原因，不是借款成功的事實，而在借款成功的意義；這一意義，尤在德義日三國同盟宣吿成立之後，格外顯露出來，起着重大的作用。</p>
<p>就借款事實言，總額不過二千五百萬美元，以此數來維持匯市，我們可以率直的說，是不會有何等效果的。何况這次借款性質，與上幾次完全相同，換言之，是過去中美借款協定的延長，事實上不是一種新借款；所以就這一借款的性質與事實言，對於匯市的影響力實亦有限。這點，我們也可從借款成功消息到滬後的實際匯市情形看出來。記得這一消息到達市塲，似在九月二十六日的午前，當時市塲上人雖知借款成功，但不知內容如何，所以傳說粉紜，因此心虛拋塞者頗不乏人，行市一度自五元三一二五長至五元四六八七五，終以五元四〇六二爲收市。（計長〇九三七五）。翌日各報揭載消息內容，行市反回緊至五元三七五。這顯然是表示不人心對此消息並不如何重視。迨至三國同盟消息傳來，（九月二十七日）才使人心激動，匯市急轉直下，自五元四〇六二五飛長至五元六二五。（九月三十日行市）</p>
<p>中美借款與三國同盟，原爲二件不同的事實，但彼此之間，却有一種因果關係。我們知道，中國對美的借款活動，已有相當時日，不成功於前，適成功於　國同盟行將宣佈之際，這顯然是表示美國的心跡；今後將加緊援　，美國自身，也有參戰的決心。在這種意義的顯示之下，有外匯在手的人，自然要恐慌起來，而匯市的趨鬆，也是必然的了。</p>
<p>「五二」後滙市的特黴</p>
<p>以上所述，不過是對「五二」後及最近匯市變動情形的一般分析。現在，我們想從「五二」後顯現在匯市方面的幾個特殊問題提出來討論；這幾個特殊的問題，一方面固可說是「五二」後匯市的特微，同時也可說是「五二」後法幣滙値能得相對穩定的原因。</p>
<p>第一，「五二」前法幣滙値之一途降落，大部固係投機活動的結果，但對外貿易之鉅額入超，也是原因之一。從海關的統計報吿來看，如果把每月的進出口金額以外匯計算起來，則自今年一月起迄八月止的全國貿易入超總額計爲四千二百萬鎊，這一入超額，如果都須結滙償付的話，則對匯市的壓力，當屬不少；但就目前匯率者，這種壓力，顯然還未表現出來。有這樣鉅額的入超，尙能維持今日的匯率，確實是一僩「謎」。或者有人以「華僑匯款」這個理由來解次這個「謎」，但去年同期也同樣有僑匯，且入超數額要比今年少（四千一百萬鎊）但滙値却比今年跌得多。我們以爲要解道個「謎」，祗有從法幣的潛力來說明。因爲過去時局的演變莫測，把法幣換成外匯儲藏起來或逃往國外的數額非常可觀；（這種外匯儲藏與逃資，均是法幣的潛力）自「五二」以後，因戰局前途樂觀，法幣地位益臻穩定，過去的逃資（包括儲藏着的外滙）都紛紛回來，（上海銀行存款的增加是一個反證）因而龐大的人超額，獲得一部分的抵補。這一事實我們並無法從統　上來證明，但確信其與「五二」後滙市的相對穩定有關係。</p>
<p>第二，任何投機家的投機活動，必有一個前提，就是要有投機的資金。如果沒有充分的資金，雖有機可投，也未必能進行。在「五二」之前，上海的游資是相當的多，因此，投機家也得利用這些游資來活動；但從滙劃貼現及銀行存款情形言，「五二」後的游資却要比先前來得更多照投機環境來說，更合乎投機的活動但事實上投機家並不能利用這些大量的游資，對滙市作比先前更大的威脅。這一現象，顯然是因投機家在「五二」後受了打擊，不敢再如往日的放肆活動，因此，予匯市的穩定以不少的助力。</p>
<p>第三，過去日人對於法幣之意識的攻擊與壓迫，與滙市之頻頻緊縮亦頗有關係。自「五二」以後，日人痛感法幣跌價於日人亦屬不利，於是停止對法幣的攻擊，改取一種比較現實的政策！一面利用法幣，一面加强軍票價値。日人這種政策的轉變，自使匯市少一重大的壓力。但是，我們要在這裏補充說明的，日人之改變對法幣的攻擊政策，不是「五二」後滙市能得相對安定的原因，相反的，是法幣實力充沛日人自知無法破壞的結果。</p>
<p>上海匯市的前途</p>
<p>今後上海匯市將如何發展呢？要解答道一問題，須人二方面來考察：第一，外匯（美元或英鎊）自身的價値是否有變動；第二，法幣的前途如何。</p>
<p>就第一點言，美元或英鎊價値是否有變動，須看太平洋的局勢如何發展。如果太平洋上沒有什麼變化，則今後美元與英鎊的價値也當然不會有什麼變動。反之，如果英美與日本在太平洋上起了衝突，則上海對英美間的交通與貿易關係，必被切斷，上海市塲將成誰家天下，也不難臆斷。這時，上海市塲是吾還有外匯的供需關係，自有疑問。因爲外滙市塲的發生，本來是根據對外貿易的關係，一旦貿易關係被切斷，則外匯的供需關係自無從發生；沒有外匯的供需關係，外滙市塲就成立不起來。這樣，儘營美元或英鎊在其國內的價値（購買力）不變，但在上海持有美元或英鎊外滙的人，因無法向該國購貨，在市上出售也沒有人要，則是項外匯，就成了一種賬簿上的財產，換言之，成了一筆無法收回的呆賬，這一呆賬何日能收回，要待戰爭結束貿易關係恢復後再說。退一步來說，就是英美與日本間在太平洋上進行戰爭，而上海對英美的貿易關係還是存在的話，則因美國施行外匯管理，美元對外價値必受影響，美元對法幣的比價也自然跌落。這一情形，在最近上海的匯市上已經顯著的表現出來。現在美日間尙未開戰，情形已經如此，正式開戰之後，影響當然更大。（美元跌價，英鎊，港幣等等也必跟了跌，自不必論）</p>
<p>其次，就法幣的前途言。如果太平洋上起了戰爭，法幣的價値當然要好起來，（已如上述）是不必說的。如果國際局勢不變，中日戰爭還是存在，我們也可以肯定的說，法幣的價値，祗有漲不會跌了。理由何在呢？</p>
<p>我們覺得法幣制度的成立與演變，頗足象徵近年中國民族的發展。法幣的生命，寄託在中國民族的統一基礎之上，所以中國法幣的命運，也與中國民族命運完全一致。耍是認定中國民族是沒有前途的，則將來法幣，也根本談不到有無價値的問題。但是目前事實所昭示我們的：中國人民經了三年多的苦鬭，在無數血與肉的犧牲上建立了民族解放的基礎，已非任任外力所能摧殘的了；因此，我們可以斷定，與民族前途相共的法幣，今後也決無再跌的理由；相反的，由於侵略者的精疲力盡，與國際局勢日趨有利，中國民族的新生命正在不斷的強大起來，今後的法幣價値，也祇有一天天的向上發展。</p>

<h3>金融述評</h3>
<p>— 聖凱瓊</p>
<p>—十月十二日—</p>
<p>外滙動向如何</p>
<p>在九月初外匯轉緊時，筆者對於外匯的觀察，謂當時滙價之緊，乃是由於舊多頭和用謠言與越南局勢，脫售它七月份所購進的八月期滙，新多則利用越南局勢希望匯價趨緊，以求發財，並預測匯價趨鬆機會大，趨緊的機會小，事實上九月份的滙市，除在四日見英三·四三七五美五·〇九三七五的全月緊價之外，市况過程雖時緊時鬆，大體上則見盤旋趨硬，不過上半月的變化尙無顯明的軌跡，轉入下半月的第一週美匯最低價均止於五·二五，第二週則開收高低的記錄均一律上昇，至於英滙最低大致止於三·四八四三七五及以上。</p>
<p>滙上盤旋趨鬆，原本是期待國際上有利中國抗戰形勢的開展。果然，美國九月二十六日正式宜稱續對中國貸款二千五百萬美元，繼之以軸心國宣稱德義日三國成立軍事經濟同盟，日本向美國的虛聲恫嚇。美國答復以應戰的各種舉措，以及英國決定重開緬甸公路。太平洋上形勢激變，外匯多頭拋售不已，美匯九月底突升至五·六二五，十月七日又升至五·七八一二五，九日更敲破六元大關，見六·〇六二五高價；英匯十月九日亦見三·八七五的高價。投機者在九月份按英三·五美五·三左右的市價購進十月期匯的，自九月底起，鑒於形勢的不利，莫不紛紛斬結，遭受損失，以免太平洋情勢再有不利多頭的發展，而遭受更大的拱失。不過外匯市况在本週末兩日又盤旋趨縮了，將來的動向又將如何呢！</p>
<p>先從國際局勢說起，這兩天匯市所以轉緊一些，便是因爲太平洋上的局勢，並無更新的發展，而在美國以堅强的行動去答復日本的虛聲恫嚇之後，「不惜一戰」的態度却變爲溫和的論調，外相松岡吾認三國盟的係針對美國，希望美國暨其他處於中立地位的國家勿捲入歐戰漩渦，並勿因中國關係或其他理由，與日本發生衝突。投機家因之認爲太平洋上的情勢雖然有一觸卽發之勢，但是日本尙不致有勇氣向美國實行作戰。次從日本的經濟上說，日本缺乏外滙，爲人共知，現在作戰的資源完靠對於英美輸出貿易的能力，日本假如不顧一切竟向英美開戰，則銷美的絲貨，銷英的棉貨，勢將失去原有的市塲，而日本經濟命脈的棉業固難向美國與埃及取得原棉的供給，更難自加拿大取得紫銅，美國取得礦物，及印度的鐵與蔴，英國的鎳·鋁·鎢等。目今美國對日經濟上的各種禁運，已使日本大感不便，一旦日木對英美開戰，則英美對日的全面經濟戰爭，將使日本輸出貿易全部停頓，軍火資源無法獲得，無待決勝於軍事，經濟上即可置日於必敗之境地，所以日本決不敢對美英作戰，利空因素消滅，行市乃見轉緊。</p>
<p>信如上面所論，目下匯市也許就在最近的水準上盤旋，或稍見緊縮亦未可知。但是太平洋上的局勢決不會就此一如日外務省發言人須磨所聲稱，「此間大局甚爲安謐」下去，德義軸心國坐令日本在越南保特其旣得的利益，軸心國挑戰的皮鞭是緊緊地在日本軍人的身上鞭策着，而滇緬公路開放，美英積極援助中國，對於日本「大東亞新秩序」的建設決心，是極大的牴觸與極大的打擊。時局變幻，利空的成份居多，利多的成份甚少，這是可以決定的。試就局勢再行推論如下：（未完）</p>

<h3>我國戰時財政　（二續）</h3>
<p>— 兪燮麟</p>
<p>（三）戰時租稅制度之改善</p>
<p>按各國財政成例之事言，增稅政策原爲戰時財政之中堅份子。五屆歐戰時，美國曾倡「半稅半債之說」；此次歐戰發生以後，英國之戰時緊急預算，達十九萬三千三百萬鎊，但其中之九萬九千七百萬鎊卽爲新增稅收；且由上屆歐戰時之經騐，戰時財政中稅收所占比例愈高，而戰後財政之整頓愈易，戰後預算卽能迅速恢復平衡。故戰時之租稅政策，爲人重視。但其增稅之或績如何，則須視乎該國之稅制，人民之納稅能力，及戰時環境爲轉移。英國之戰時稅收所以能達滿意之地步，因其平時財政已以直接稅爲主幹。但我國則不然，平時財政以關鹽統三稅爲主，沿海各省相繼淪陷以後，收卽吿激减。但爲彌補此項短虧，而父顧及人民之負担公平，故對於稅制之整頓，頗爲積極。稅制之整頓，可使戰時稅收增加，又可爲戰後財政打好一良好之基礎。茲將戰時之租稅政策，分三端言之：</p>
<p>（一）直接稅因其合乎公平，普遍，與富於彈性三原則，故被稱爲良稅。在默美各國之平時財政，亦均以直接稅爲主，而於戰時及戰後，一則更爲重要。我國財政當局，有鑒於斯，故努力於建造直接稅系統，使今後之稅收重心，能置於直接稅上。直接稅則以所得稅。遺產稅。非常時期過分利得稅及印花稅爲中堅。所得稅雖創辦未久，對於課稅方法亦未臻完備，且當今戰區擴大之際，但稅收較之戰前已倍增。遺產稅亦已定於本年七月一日起正式開徵。至於非常時期過分利得稅亦已普遍推行，而成績甚佳。印花稅亦於二十六年十月十一日起，提高稅率，擴充粘貼範圍。以今日國稅稅收狀况而言，直接稅收已由戰前之第六位，進至第三位。若能將直接稅制力加改善，則將來稅收之增加，必未可限量，對於戰後財政之整理，必有偉大之貢獻。</p>
<p>（三）我國間接稅制甚不合理，奢侈品之稅率似覺尙低，日用品之稅率已感過高，使人民負担益爲不公平。政府當局爲彌補關鹽統三稅稅收短絀起見，對於間接稅制積極加以整頓，使稅制漸趨於合理，人民負担較爲公平。並在不妨礙人民生活與國民經濟之中，將稅率酌量提高，以裕國庫。例如：（一）整頓鹽稅；（二）於二十六年十月一日起擴充土貨轉口稅；（三）統稅改由入境第一度主管統稅機關查騐補徵，並推廣於內地各省；（四）於二十六年十月十三日起實施土酒加徵與舉辦土烟絲稅；（五）修改關稅稅率，凡必需品之輸入，减低稅率，照現行稅率改爲三分之一；至於土貨出口，於二十七年六月一日起於現行出口選擇手工藝品·漁業產品·農業品三十四，免徵出口稅，以利外銷。由上所述，政府對於稅率，增减均有，所增者均屬奢侈品，旣可增加稅收，又可勵行節的。</p>
<p>（三）我國財政當局爲體恤民艱，愛護民力起見，對於戰區及接近戰區之受戰事影響者，酌予豁免或减租稅，以輕人民之負担，使受戰事影響之區域，得以漸次恢復元氣，培養將來之稅源。</p>
<p>總之，我國戰時租稅制度之整頓，其目的不僅在求目前收入之增加，在乎建立健全之稅制，開闢台理之稅源，使人平負祖公民，稅收富有彈性，爲戰後財政，樹立一堅强之基礎。</p>
<h3>蘇德貿易制度</h3>
<p>— 武堉幹答</p>
<p>（一）德國與英美國際貿易方式有何不同？</p>
<p>德國的對外貿外貿易，現在是在政府跋厲的統制下面進行着，這和英美國際貿易不同的地方：就本質上言，只是統制的程度有深淺不同：就方法上說，也只是統制的範圍各別。原來德國自一九三六年經濟統制的新計劃完成以後，對外貿易的統制，是較英美等國更嚴厲，英美等國常藉關稅政策等項為統制貿易的工具，而德國現在却是偏重於進口外匯的統制。進口的經營，雖可由人民自由；可是進口貨價的匯付，即須事先取得統制機關的外匯發兌批准，否則是不許劃付的。政府所以要這樣的統制進口外匯，自然也和前幾年極力進行的進出口貨品交換制度一樣，都是想藉此限制不必要的進口，以謀對外貿易收支的平衡。所以這種統制的方式，在德國也自以為是略勝於英美的自由貿易制度。至於出口貿易方面，近來德國對於出口外匯也是統制的。出口商固然可儘量把貨物運銷國外，但是所得外匯是要按照政府所規定的匯率售給政府的。這都是德國統制對外貿易較英美為嚴厲的地方。</p>

<h3>編結事業在上海</h3>
<p>— 斯華</p>
<p>編結的歷史</p>
<p>絨綫輸入中國，遠在五十餘年以前，當時用途不多，僅供紮髮而已。後來西人將編結技術介紹於衆，幫助絨綫之銷售，果然發生特效。但結法平凡，無所謂花樣式樣，也沒有專門編結人材，最初用絨綫手結而成的僅有帽子，手套，鞋子和圍巾數種，襯裏絨綫背心之編結還是後來的事情，因質輕溫暖，遠較棉背心爲佳，故曾風行一時。到民國廿二年，天津羝羊牌絨綫廠在上海開展覽會，假中國國貨公司，先施公司，麗華公司舉行，請廖鳳華女士等分別主持絨綫編結法傳授事宜，新式編結法的公開於世，當以此爲嚆矢。</p>
<p>編結的人物</p>
<p>首先應提到的，當推黃培英女士。黃女士畢業於民立女子中學後，卽負笈東渡，專攻絨錢編結，民十七回國，發明檯針機，民十八呈准國民政府，獲得專利，曾創辦培央傳習所，著有培英編結法，其作品曾在普益習藝所國貨展覽會獲得特等獎章，廿二年應麗華公司羝羊牌絨綫部聘爲編結敎授，理論技術，兩皆完美，堪稱編結界先進。與黃女士齊名的尙有鮑國芳女士，伊之硏究絨綫編結，爲期甚早，民廿二年在上海中國國貨公司羝羊牌絨綫部任編結敎授，决年赴蘇州中國國貨公司主持又决年赴松江中國國貨公司主持，嗣後曾在中西電台播音傳授編結法，空氣中之編結法傳授，以鮑女士爲第一人，伊著有編結專書，至今仍銷行甚佳。再决爲馮秋萍女士，伊畢業求德女中，在校時對絨錢編結卽感極大興趣，課餘硏習發明許多新奇花式，同學每多向伊請益，無形中伊已成爲編結敎師，出校後曾任大新，新新，福安等公司編結敎授，並創有良友編結社，門牆桃李甚多。尙有倪秀悅女士，現服務於興聖街絨綫巨擘恒源祥總店，諄諄以最新頴之編結法授顧客，並受上海毛絨廠之聘於每晨十時起在新華電台播音敎授，倪女士精於編結，態度和藹，實爲編結界後起之秀。</p>
<p>編結的展望</p>
<p>編結不能僅以女紅之一種目之，此實為許多婦女從事生產之新路，觀於目前絨綫衣服之風行上海，將來必能普及全國，鄉村婦女雖不少諳編結技能者，但墨守陳規，不知改良，亟須加以提示，作者甚望將來有編結雜誌之印行，編結職校之設立，甚至編結社一似蘇廣成衣舖，街頭巷尾，到處可見。</p>
<p>織工的隱痛</p>
<p>自外匯繁縮後，海外乃以大量絨綫輸入，利用中國極微工資，招工編結，然後再運往歐美，經營此種出口事業者為英商赫德生洋行及信記洋行，目前以手套為大宗，彼等以每付四角餘之工資發出，中經大包小包數重剝削，工人實際所得爲數僅二角餘，而句工據以自肥，有因之積資數十萬者。願出口商行，顧念女工之生活艱難，謀一補救辦法，或直接發與工人，則更爲工人所熱望也。</p>

<h3>送「日光節約運動」</h3>
<p>— 楊志誠</p>
<p>「日光節的運動」已於本月十二結束了。這個運動的原意是想革除一般人對時間的浪費的壞習慣，使得節省物力人力，其用意湛深可見一般。但是這個習慣的養成，當然不能像某些人所說：「中國人的本性是懶惰的，不節省時間的」來籠統地包括的。試看在中國廣大的鄕村裏，人們數千年來承襲着「日出而作，日入而息」的習慣不怠；卽使在上海，大多數的人們（職工·學生等）也還是很有規律地把握他們的時間而不浪費的。但也不可吾認，上海是有着許多日當夜以當日的人們，這當然不單單是「習慣」的問題了。而是上海這個社會。它產生了各式各樣的人們，更產生了一批成日荒淫作樂者，於是賭塲，舞塲，戲館，…道是資本主義社會不可免避的畸形發展啊！日光節的運動的結果，或者使他們改變了些生活的時間，但是問題的癥結是在於他們的「生活」。時間的節的與生活的整頓原是不可分離的二個環節，一個生活充實而緊張的人，他決不會浪費他的時間的。反之，一個閒散荒淫的人，時間的節的對於他的生活究竟有什麼絲毫的改進呢？所以當着日光節的運動結束的時候，我們希望每僩人深深地審查一下自己的生活，使每一分鐘的時間做有利於改進的事業上。假使每個人能節省和支配他的時間，那也不必大聲疾呼什麼「日光節的運動」了。</p>
<h3>利用練習生做投機</h3>
<p>— 白書年</p>
<p>某商號之惡毒政策</p>
<p>上海淪爲「孤島」，遂造成各業之畸形發展，允其是投機事業蓬勃盛興，出人意表　在證券，外滙，棉布，食糧及日用品圍疇之外，竟有利用招考練習生爲名，從事引誘失業失學靑年之投機資本家，橫暴慘酷之手段演愈演愈烈，實又爲社會上一嚴重之問題。</p>
<p>筆者家庭原僻處鄕間，僅筆者在外爲衣食奔走。「八一三」事變後，鄕間蒙受影響，遂避難來滬，數口之家，賴筆者微薄薪金以維持，亦至苦事。時弟方卒業小學，因無力櫃續求讀，乃應某商號招考練習生之徵，前往考試，竟獲錄取。筆者乃與該號接洽一切手續，由經理延見，面授規程，內有練習期間爲三年，由號中津貼零用每月叫元，在限期之內，練習生或因犯規而被號中開除，或目行吿退者，則在職期中所有號中耗於該生之膳宿等費，須由該生負賠償責任，幷須具備殷實保證人。至練習生之工作情形，明文未載，筆者當時雖覺條件太苛，然迫於生計，亦不得不默爾承受。吾弟入該號未及一月，卽向筆者訴說工作勞苦，待遇苛刻之情形，當時筆者意或爲少年不耐勞苦之通病，故勸其努力，母遇難而退却。於今時將三載，吾弟前日歸來，忽鄭重向筆者聲言：目下危機將至。詢其原因，蓋該號經理於數日前，竟藉故開除其他練習生數名，因而索回賠償費達千餘元之巨。兎死狐悲，物傷其類，共事者咸悚悚自危；蓋人孰無過，倘偶一不愼，在在均有藉口被開除之危險；個人旣失業，幷須担負賠償費用，名譽方面，復蒙影響，前途隱憂實深。筆者處於極困難之境，除勉余弟格外謹愼外，無別法。</p>
<p>竊思人家子弟，棄學經商，原冀學習謀生技術，俾能立足社會，孰料喪心病在之徒於此失業嚴重時期，竟從而利用之。况練習生之工作繁重，可以倍於普通職員，然幷不支出薪金，今復施此種甚於欺詐之手段，加之於一輩清寒失學靑年，能不令人切齒！社會不乏主持正義者，為特鏤述始末，以爲呼籲。　（却酬）</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第九章　驚人消息</p>
<p>我點頭道：「是的。那末，你想這個甲印是老毛留下的嗎？」</p>
<p>霍桑忽然站起來，一壁搖着頭，嘴裏自言自語說：「我不知道。我委實還解釋不出。」他把兩隻手放在背後交握着，開始在辦公室中低著頭踱來踱去，顯見他又已陷入深思狀態。</p>
<p>室中靜默了一回，霍桑仍沒有什麼表示。我有些忍耐不住，父問道：</p>
<p>「霍桑，你在想什麼？照你說，那陸健生旣然已解除了行兇的可能，余甘棠的供詞假使完全可信，也不像那案中的主兇，那末，三僩嫌疑人祇剩趙伯雄一個人了。現在叉根據余甘棠的證實——那自然要憑他的話完全可信，作一個先決條件——趙伯雄的嫌疑，更耍加深了一層。我們祇要逼他實供出來，自然可以水落石出。擬怎麼反而這樣子躇躊不決？——霍桑，你究竟在想些什麼？怎不說出來聽聽？」</p>
<p>霍桑的步子仍舊不停，神思倘怳地答道：「我在想趙伯雄的冷笑，又在想——」</p>
<p>一陣急促的電話鈴聲，把他的語聲打斷了。霍桑突的停了脚步，略一躊躇，忙奔到電話機旁去。我也跟着他過去，好像我有一種本能的直覺，覺得這一次電話裹會有什麼驚人的消息。霍桑拿起聽筒接話以後，我知道對方是倪金壽。倪金壽的聲音特別響亮，我站在旁邊，句句都聽得清楚。那消息果眞是驚人的。</p>
<p>倪金壽道：「霍先生，事情弄僵了——僵透了！趙伯雄已經走了！」</p>
<p>霍桑那隻握聽簡的手，也震了一震，張大着眼睛問道：「走了？可是逃走的？」</p>
<p>「不是，崔廳長放他走的。我在家裏吃過了飯，趕到廳裏去，準備要向趙伯雄問話。據說他起先寫了一個紙條給廳長，後來又要求打一個電話出去。一回，廳長就叫他進見，談了一回，當塲把他放掉，你想這件事尶尬不尶尬？」</p>
<p>「奇怪！」霍桑除了這兩個字以外，竟說不出別的話。他呆住了。我也認爲這個消息太出人意外，一時非但想不出應付的步驟，速那崔廳長憑着什麼理由，竟濫用權力，把這樣一個最重要的嫌疑主犯輕輕放掉，也完全捉模不著。不料那驚人消息又接連着從電話中傳出來。（一三五）</p>
<h3>從「監獄人滿」說起</h3>
<p>— 史偉</p>
<p>本月十日各報載有一則値得重視的新聞，那就是法租界馬斯南路江蘇上海第二特區監獄，因爲監房並不廣大，所以會規定監犯之容量不得超過一千六百人；「惟自「八一三」滬戰發生，生活日益高昂後，作奸犯之徒，亦與日俱增。」據云最多時竟達二千五百餘，而當局因爲經濟困難，所以在本年二月曾將判處徒刑五年以下及非累犯者，准予保釋，至本月九日爲止，巳舉辦過四决了。</p>
<p>因生活「高昂」而去作「奸犯」，這可說是「自古已然，於今爲烈」。事實非常明白，一個人不生在世上則已，一生在世上總要想活下去的；而當睏水門汀，倒冷飯不能維持呼吸的時候，那就要抱着「與其餓煞，不如犯法」的「生存原則」來鋌而走險了，而偶然得免脫法網的話，那當然還可以挨些日脚；卽使不幸被獲，也還可以去「坐吃監飯」的。</p>
<p>寫到這裏，想起故事來了：幾年前，就在上海，有一個失業巳久的靑年，因生計無着，去投黃浦了；結果被救生會救起。救生會裏的當事人對他說：「你年紀輕輕，萬事要想得開些。」但那個靑年回答說：「我沒有飯吃，你能救救我嗎？」當事人說這不在他們的職權之內，於是在第二天，黃浦江上浮起屍首來了。</p>
<p>現在這被保釋的幾百個奸犯中，是吾還會有「重登禁地」的，那有待於事實的證明；但觀於搶竊舞弊的流行，那末「後來者」是大有人在的。這樣說來，安定市民生活，制裁市民生活的擾亂者—特別是「米蛀虫」，該是刻不容緩的急務了。</p>

<h3>U.S. Government Dispatches Two Giant Ships to the Far East to Transport American Nationals; Roosevelt Sternly Criticizes the Tripartite Pact; Rumor of U.S. Fleet Sailing to Singapore Within the Month</h3>
<p>Washington - Secretary of State Hull, while hosting news reporters yesterday, stated that as soon as two American giant ships, the Washington and the Manhattan, are inspected and ready for service, they will be dispatched to the Far East to transport American nationals. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Washington - Secretary of State Hull announced yesterday that the two large liners "Manhattan" and "Washington" are currently being prepared to urgently sail to the Far East to facilitate the evacuation of American nationals from China, Japan, Hong Kong, and Vietnam. News from New York indicates that the "Washington" has received orders to sail to Shanghai on Thursday. Officials of the U.S. Mail Steamship Company declined to comment on the order for the ship's preparation for sailing. This order was received late last night from Washington. The General Manager of the U.S. Mail Steamship Company is currently in Washington conferring with U.S. Customs officials. The United States will prepare sufficient tonnage of ships in the Pacific to handle the evacuation of American nationals from the Far East. These American nationals will swiftly evacuate according to the State Department's "recommendation." The "Washington" will depart on Thursday; if workers can quickly add seating in the ship's large cabins, it may depart earlier. Customs officials declared yesterday that they are in negotiations with the U.S. Mail Steamship Company to utilize the largest liners in case of emergencies to evacuate American nationals from the Far East. Shipping circles indicate that the recently completed "America" ship could be used in emergencies. During periods of extreme tension, U.S. Navy and Army transport ships can also assist with evacuation matters. (Taiwan Public Telegraph, 13th)</p>
<p>Washington - A non-official authority here, the "Army and Navy Journal," carried a report yesterday stating that the United States may expand its embargo against Japan within the month and order U.S. warships to Singapore to take parallel action with Britain in reopening the Burma Road. The report stated, "The next ten days will be a crucial period for determining the extent to which the war will spread and whether the United States will move closer to war." The report stated that when Britain reopens the Burma Road on October 17, the United States will reaffirm its support for Britain's action. According to the report, this declaration may be made in a new form that goes beyond official documents, "It is highly possible that it will be done by sending U.S. warships to Singapore or expanding the embargo against Japan." Observers point out that the newspaper's commentary on the Far East coincides with the State Department's announcement that two giant U.S. liners will be dispatched to the East within the week to expedite the evacuation of nationals. General developments over the past week have strongly reinforced the view among people here that the administration is planning to take stronger steps in the Far East.

<h3>U.S. Military Aid to Britain Cannot Be Prevented by Other Nations; Roosevelt's Columbus Day Speech</h3>
<p>Dayton, Ohio - President Roosevelt delivered today one of the strongest-worded speeches of his life. Roosevelt declared in his speech that the Allied nations in Europe and Asia cannot prevent the United States from aiding Britain, which is fighting to the death with the Axis powers. The President's speech was broadcast via radio to the entire United States and the twenty sister republics of the Western Hemisphere. Roosevelt said during the broadcast, "The United States does not want to fight with any nation," but the reason for its full armament on both oceans is that recent history shows that the promises of dictatorships in Europe and Asia are worthless. At the same time, Roosevelt directly stated that no country or group intends to prevent the United States from aiding Britain. Roosevelt's resolute speech is one of the strongest speeches he has made in his long political career. Roosevelt's speech was delivered from a temporary studio in the dining car of the presidential train, which has just concluded its tour of defense facilities in Pennsylvania and Ohio and arrived here today. President Roosevelt resolutely defended the government's "gradually drawing us into the war" policy. (International Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>American Nationals in Japan Consider Evacuation; American Business "The Japan Advertiser" Ceases Publication</p>
<p>Tokyo - According to news here today, most American missionaries in Japan are currently awaiting developments in the Japanese attitude. Fifty to one hundred people have already planned to leave Tokyo. There are over nine hundred American nationals in Tokyo and Yokohama. Reports from Korea indicate that American missionaries there have also planned to stay, but their activities have recently become visibly unwelcome. (United Press dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - A dispatch from Tokyo states that the American business publication "The Japan Advertiser" announced its cessation of publication effective immediately and its merger with the Japanese English-language evening newspaper "The Japan Times," only seventeen days away from its 50th anniversary.

<p>Dayton, Ohio - President Roosevelt gave a speech here last night, announcing the Western Hemisphere's doctrine of "all for one, one for all," while also criticizing the new military alliance between Japan and the Axis powers. The President declared that the United States has decided to continue its aid to Britain because "that country's heroic war prevents aggression from approaching our shores." The President added, "We are determined to aid the last free nation in the world. The dictators of Europe and Asia, even if they unite, cannot change America's intention. Britain is actively fighting, keeping the dictatorships beyond the gulf." Roosevelt also stated that the U.S. rearmament program is for the defense of the United States, "and to cooperate with the democratic nations of the Americas to defend the Western Hemisphere. An unprecedented crisis has prompted the United States to build a stronger naval and air force to protect American seaports and resist any combined enemy." The President added that the United States has obtained eight new naval and air bases in the Western Hemisphere from Britain, which "is not only to protect America itself." According to the President, "The reason why the United States obtained these bases is to protect the entire Western Hemisphere, and all the democratic nations of the Americas can jointly use them." Roosevelt also endorsed America's intention to continue to "traditionally use the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans peacefully." He solemnly declared that, in the past few years, he has done everything in his power to keep the United States and the American democratic nations from participating in any wars in the world. (United Press dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Columbus - President Roosevelt received a 21-gun salute yesterday on Columbus Day when he visited local manufacturing plants and steel mills here. The factories visited by the President are all participating in the national rearmament movement. When the President arrived, thousands of local residents crowded the streets adorned with national flags, cheering loudly and watching the presidential motorcade pass by. Later, the President gave a speech, the main point of which was to urge the public to accelerate the production of defense materials. The President said, "The best way to avoid being attacked is to be prepared to accept attacks from others at any time. Therefore, steel manufacturers once told the workers in the factory, 'Our other requirement for rapidly increasing production is to further increase speed. The faster, the better. I especially declare this intention to you. You must accelerate as much as you can within your ability.'" The President told reporters in his special train heading here yesterday morning that the United States could avoid being drawn into a widespread war vortex, but the President demanded that the rearmament program be completed as soon as possible to make the United States unbreakable. The President also said that he felt it was difficult to maintain a non-belligerent position in a world at war, but he declared boldly that he believed the United States would be able to avoid participating in the war. Columbus residents enthusiastically celebrated yesterday under the President's leadership, with parades and speeches everywhere. All shops and markets were closed. Most states and counties were officially closed for holidays. In New York City, no fewer than thousands of people participated in the grand parade, including garrison troops and various social, political, and patriotic organizations. All parades stopped at the Columbus Circle. The local mayor, La Guardia, stood before a huge bronze statue of Columbus and gave a closing speech, urging the American people to unite to jointly defend the Western Hemisphere. At the same time, various Italian organizations held parades here to celebrate the 447th anniversary of the discovery of America. (United Press dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>New York - Former Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Yarnell, warned the American people yesterday while attending the Columbus Day celebration here that if the Axis powers control Africa, the defense of South America will be impossible. The Admiral pointed out that the victory of Germany, Italy, and Japan will threaten world civilization. The Admiral finally predicted that issues related to post-war economic trade, currency, and tariffs must be discussed by organizing an international association. (United Press dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>New York - Commander of the New York Garrison, General Bowler, spoke last night at a public celebration of Columbus Day in New York, warning Americans about the ethnic prejudice that might occur after the outbreak of the European war. (United Press dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>The United States Has No Intention of Avoiding Responsibility for Defending the Philippine Islands</p>
<p>Washington - The non-official authority, "Army and Navy Journal," carried a report here yesterday stating that the United States has no intention of avoiding its responsibility to defend the Philippine Islands in the event of war in the Pacific. Although the newspaper is privately run, it usually reflects the opinions of senior government officials on the government's defense policy. The newspaper said that the United States' guarantee to defend the Philippines has been "repeatedly stated in Manila, London, and elsewhere." The newspaper stated, "High Commissioner of the Philippines, Mr. Sayre, publicly declared in Manila this week that the United States is preparing for events in the Far East, which has broad implications. If the people of the Philippines mobilize for training, the United States will provide munitions and training facilities at the request of recent Philippine officials." The newspaper continued, stating that the U.S. plan to defend the Philippines does not mean that the United States will cancel other important regional defense plans, "Washington's attention to Philippine development has been unprecedented in recent years." (United Press dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Deploy Mobile Anti-Aircraft Artillery Units Along the Coast</p>
<p>Washington - It was learned here today that the United States, learning from the lessons of the European war, has abandoned the suggestion of surrounding its densely populated cities with fixed anti-aircraft artillery units and will rely on powerful and rapid mobile units. The National Defense Commission, on the advice of anti-aircraft artillery strategists of the Army Department, is now allocating huge sums to purchase equipment for mobile units. This equipment can shoot down aircraft at altitudes of over 20,000 feet. The Army Department's research on air-raid shelters has been completed and will be announced next week. Several major coastal cities need to build air-raid shelters. It was learned from international sources that several senior officials, during secret presentations before the Congressional Committee, have convinced congressional leaders that enemy aircraft attacking the United States will be limited to a few hundred due to the protection of the vast oceans. In the event of an air raid on the United States, mobile units can immediately rush to the threatened city upon receiving the alarm. However, officials refused to disclose what kind of air defense equipment exists or what equipment has been ordered. Military experts are currently drafting plans to establish naval and air bases in Newfoundland, Bermuda, British Guiana, Antigua, Trinidad, the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Saint Lucia. Reliable sources claim that President Roosevelt will request Congress to allocate $600 million to build and improve these bases in the Pacific. (International Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Military Equipment - Ambitious Plan</h3>
<p>Washington - It was learned here today that although the U.S. Army Department's plan has not been formally announced, defense army leaders have accepted the following procedures: (1) The current military strength of the Defense Army will increase to approximately 400,000 by January 1 of next year. (2) Each division will include 14,000 soldiers. (3) Four more divisions will be added by October 15, and further increases will continue by December 15. (4) All soldiers will be equipped with various new weapons currently being manufactured, and then they will undergo the largest field exercises. (5) Then, the soldiers will take on garrison duties as part of the regular army duties. If an accident occurs, the peacetime military strength of 14,000 men per division can be increased to a wartime military strength of 19,000 men per division. The U.S. government has ordered four full divisions to enlist, consisting of four infantry regiments, three artillery, engineering, medical, and quartermaster regiments. Garrison camp sites are under construction, with barracks and training grounds that can accommodate more than double the current number of national defense troops already enlisted. The troops are trained according to wartime military strength, not peacetime military strength. General military leaders generally believe that after this group of soldiers has undergone training camp, they will be transferred to the nearest base to Britain, Panama, Cuba, Alaska, Puerto Rico and other island nations.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Wishing Thailand Self-Respect</h3>
<p>Ten days ago, Japanese articles expressed a threatening tone towards the opening of the Burma Road, saying that if Britain reopened the road, it would inevitably lead to the outbreak of a world war. Now, the imminent opening of the road has become a fait accompli because of the offensive Japan has taken against Britain and the United States. As for whether a world war will break out immediately as a result, the negative answer has been obtained in the recent attitude of the Japanese authorities. Therefore, the Chongqing side had speculated that if Japan had no countermeasures, the current cabinet would inevitably fall. This view still held that the Japanese authorities would inevitably take some kind of countermeasures, whether for the sake of interest or face. The easiest thing to do would be the bombings that the Japanese side has already publicly declared. In addition, according to news from Vichy yesterday, it was rumored that the Japanese side would use Thailand to create "disturbances" before the road opened, and use Thailand as a base for attacking the Yunnan-Burma Road traffic. The Thai authorities also expressed an intention to cooperate with the Tripartite Pact. After Japan occupied northern Vietnam, its second goal for southward expansion was none other than Thailand. If at this time it could use the pretext of disrupting the Yunnan-Burma Road to seize bases in Thailand and bring Thailand into its fold, nothing could be better. What is incomprehensible is why the Thai authorities would willingly be used by others? When France and Japan were negotiating the Vietnam issue, Thailand also took the opportunity to demand land from Vietnam, causing disturbances for many days, and recently ended temporarily with the organization of a mixed delegation. In Thailand, this has already formed an objective accomplice, but it is not without reason to recover lost territory. As for the aforementioned rumors, it is tantamount to using the nation's fortune as a lone bet to engage in a major international gambling adventure.</p>
<p>The extent to which Thailand will help Japan still needs to be proven by the facts, but it can be asserted that its importance lies not in China but in British Burma. Because Thailand and China do not border each other, and the airports in Thailand are farther from Yunnan Province than Hanoi and Lao Cai, Japan cannot obtain any convenience from Siamese territory for invading Yunnan Province. On the other hand, if it is used to spy on British bases, Thailand has significant value. Rangoon, the capital of Burma, is not far from the Thai-Burma border, and is most susceptible to threats from Thai territory. At the same time, the Kra Isthmus is a vital threat to the east coast of the Indian Ocean, and the southern end of the Siamese peninsula directly threatens the back of the Malay Peninsula, which can make the Singapore fortress face enemies on both sides. If the status quo is changed by force, it will naturally not be tolerated or tolerated by Britain or even the United States. On the Thai side, at what cost or conditions would it lightly throw itself into a dangerous international vortex, and would not hesitate to abandon its long-standing policy of neutrality and side with Japan to become an enemy of Britain and the United States, is a huge question.</p>
<p>Thailand is the only remaining independent country in South Asia, and its years of striving to move upstream have also been sympathized with by the world. However, since the military took power, it has lacked vision and firm views, and has been blindly seeking immediate gains and admiring the strong and bullying the weak. It has sought to attach itself to aggressive countries, and has frequently slandered neighboring countries struggling to survive. Although its diplomatic policy seems to be operating in many ways, it is secretly based on relations with Japan and even Germany and Italy. This situation has painted a bleak prospect for Thailand's future. Therefore, the current rumors of participating in the Tripartite Pact and even acting as a scapegoat for aggressors are not impossible. Its recent threat to demand territory by taking advantage of France and Vietnam's danger has been widely recognized as unjust. If it further deeply integrates with the axis of aggression, its intentions can hardly be understood by ordinary people. The United States' note to Thailand to maintain the status quo and restrict the transportation of military supplies to Thailand has provided an initial warning: if it increasingly reverses course, it will inevitably encounter greater international pressure. Moreover, Thailand is situated between two major powers. Relatively speaking, the pressure from British India and Burma is more direct and imminent. Even if Japan has obtained bases in northern Vietnam, it may not be able to provide effective support to Thailand other than pursuing its own expansionist ambitions. As for Germany and Italy to Thailand, they are even beyond their reach. In this way, if it wants to hastily form an alliance with a country that cannot be waited for, offending a strong neighbor nearby, it is feared that it will be even more detrimental than beneficial for both Britain and Japan to join the Tripartite Pact, but from Thailand's own situation, it is obviously more clumsy than Japan.</p>
<p>In this increasingly acute international confrontation, the only way for small countries to protect themselves is to be firm and calm, to uphold justice and not be biased. Even if they encounter adversity, they do not worry about having nothing to survive, such as Switzerland, which is a clear example. If it does not measure its virtue and strength, and rashly thinks of attaching itself to a powerful beam and sharing the leftovers, and the country it regards as its ally is even a country that has always been known for disregarding faith, this is no different from treading on thin ice and treading on a tiger's tail. It is an extremely foolish adventure. As Poland and Romania have lacked firm views on their foreign policies and have been deeply associated with aggressors, they have finally fallen into a situation of being unable to recover. These lessons are all worth learning from Thailand today.</p>
<p>From the common standpoint of small nations, Thailand has no relationship. If from the common standpoint of Eastern small nations, Thailand should not be afraid to support the opening of the Yunnan-Burma Road, because China's interests are also the common interests of Eastern small nations, and Thailand cannot exclude itself from this. If the current Thai authorities still lack this kind of understanding and awareness, then at the very least, it is hoped that they can turn their attention from those who are concerned about the Yunnan-Burma Road to the future of their own national destiny.</p>

<p>Vichy: According to news from French sources in Bangkok yesterday evening, Thailand may assist Japan in keeping the Yunnan-Burma Road closed after the United Kingdom reopens it on October 17th.

<h3>The U.S. Presidential Election Situation Gradually Becomes Tense, Willkie Gains Many Votes in the East</h3>
<p>Washington: According to the most recent surveys, the upcoming presidential election will depend on undecided voters in three or four pivotal states. The votes of one state could decide the outcome of a race that has been close for years, but the final three weeks of the race could also overturn the current situation. President Roosevelt, in his bid for a third term, is in a favorable position, but Republican candidate Willkie has made great gains in the last three weeks, especially in the East. Democrats are secretly concerned about Pennsylvania, Illinois, New York, and Massachusetts, as their votes in the election will reach 119, accounting for one-quarter of the 531 total votes cast in the last election. All political observers in the United States believe that the election may be decided in the last few days, and it is generally expected that there will be surprising moves, and it is expected that there will be many split tickets at that time. (13th International News Agency dispatch)</p>

Therefore, Willkie had engaged in anti-black activities in Elwood City in Japan. (13th United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Demonstrations Held in Various Parts of Japan to Celebrate the Tripartite Pact, Matsuoka Speaks at Public Assembly</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka spoke to more than 50,000 people at Hibiya Park yesterday at a rally celebrating the establishment of the Tripartite Alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan. He said that he believed Germany and Italy would win, but if the war situation was unfavorable to Germany and Italy, Japan would help them. Matsuoka also admitted that Japan was willing to make peace with China as soon as possible, but this peace should be an honorable peace. Matsuoka said, "We are willing to reach peace as soon as possible, but this peace must be an honorable peace. If the Japanese people are tired of the China Incident, then they are not suitable to be the people under the principle of "Eight Corners under One Roof," and the days to come for our country, I dare to say, may be limited." Matsuoka also said, "I think Germany and Italy will win this war, but if the war situation is unfavorable to them, Japan should be prepared to help them. We should be prepared to fight alongside Germany and Italy. I don't care whether the Japanese people agree with this alliance, because I think Germany and Italy will win." Matsuoka said that Japan's conclusion of this alliance was because Germany and Italy recognized the principle on which Japan had built its country for 2,600 years, that is, "Eight Corners under One Roof," which means "One World Family." Matsuoka also said that the alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan welcomes any other country that agrees with the spirit of "Eight Corners under One Roof," but we will resolutely exclude any country that hinders the spirit of "Eight Corners under One Roof." Matsuoka then pointed out that Japan's past foreign policy was too weak, saying that since Germany and Italy withdrew from the League of Nations, these three countries should cooperate with each other. He also said that the alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan was established for peace, to prevent neutral countries from participating in the European War and the Sino-Japanese War, and to ensure that every country has its proper place. Matsuoka also emphasized that the alliance signatories had decided not to engage in combat with any country that attacked Germany, Italy, or Japan. Matsuoka then read to the public a speech by Prime Minister Konoe, which emphasized that the Tripartite Pact was the driving force for building a new order in Europe and Asia for the purpose of world peace. Matsuoka read this article because Prime Minister Konoe was suffering from a slight illness and could not attend the speech in person. Konoe's article also stated that Japan was facing a critical turning point, and therefore the government had taken a decision to build a new national structure. German Ambassador to Japan Ott and Italian Ambassador Indelli also gave speeches to celebrate Japan's alliance with Germany and Italy. (13th United Press dispatch)</p>

<h3>Preliminary Control of the Balkans, German Troops Invade Romania Becomes a Reality, Turkey Issues Strong Warning to the Axis Powers, Two Million Soldiers Ready to Resist Aggression, Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union Returns to His Post to Discuss How to Deal with the Situation</h3>
<p>London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that the situation in the Balkans is gradually becoming clearer. The invasion of Romania by German troops is beyond doubt and has now been confirmed by official circles. This development at least shows Germany's policy, which is a preliminary step in controlling the Balkan Peninsula, or a sign of abandoning the plan to invade Britain this year. It will not be a matter of a day or two for Germany to occupy the entire territory of Romania, but it will take several weeks to complete. After that, it will deal with the problems of Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Greece. However, these three countries are not as easy to deal with as Romania. Germany will probably ask Yugoslavia to allow its troops to pass through with a sad and beautiful plea, and will promise Bulgaria Greek territory in the Aegean Sea. However, according to newspaper reports, Bulgaria, regardless of Italy's pressure, has refused Italy's bribe. The Bulgarian government maintains a correct and friendly relationship with the Southern and Hellenic countries, and its attitude towards Turkey is also very firm. Therefore, the propaganda of Germany and Italy has not made any progress in Bulgaria. Although the situation may change after the German army occupies Romania, there are still forces that are unfavorable to the Axis powers, such as the attitude of the Soviet Union, which is enough to influence the situation. At the same time, Turkey also issued a strong statement, expressing its attitude, which cannot be ignored by the Axis powers. This statement reflects the official opinion, warning Germany that 2 million Turkish soldiers stand on the way to the Bosphorus Strait and the Middle East. Turkey is not only bound by the British treaty, but also wants to fulfill its obligations. Turkey's remarks can be said to be a timely warning. (13th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Ankara: Turkish Prime Minister Saydam had a long discussion with Soviet Ambassador Vinogradov yesterday. The content of the talks was not revealed by officials, but it is believed that they must have studied the possible consequences of the Axis invasion of the Balkans. (13th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Moscow: Dr. Akita, the Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, returned to Moscow last night after resting in Ankara for two months. At this time, just when the Axis powers and the Soviet Union are about to be in conflict due to Germany's "bloodless" invasion of the Balkans, it is believed here that the Ambassador's return to Moscow is an attempt to form a united front with the Soviet Union to deal with Germany's southward advance from the Balkans and the threat of the country's invasion of Greece and Yugoslavia. (13th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Well-informed sources here said last night that Ambassador Akita suddenly returned to Moscow from Ankara and was about to seek the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Axis powers' invasion of the Balkans. Reliable sources also said that Akita carried instructions to inquire about the Soviet Union's policy on Turkey's armed assistance to Greece. The British believe that in the current situation, the Soviet Union will not interfere with Turkey, but it is believed that the Soviet Union will guarantee Turkey that if Turkey decides to assist Greece, the Red Army will not attack Turkish territory. As for the entry of German troops into Romania, it is deeply believed here that Mr. Akita will also ask the Soviet Union to express its attitude in his talks in the Soviet Union. (13th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Istanbul: Although Turkish people have seen the lurking threat of the German army's occupation of Romania, they do not want to worry unnecessarily before clarifying the strength of this occupied army. According to Ankara's opinion, the Soviet Union should be more concerned about this Nazi action than Turkey. Germany may be worried about the uncertainty of the Soviet Union's policy, so it preemptively acted to prevent the Red Army from invading Romania and losing the oil production needed for British military affairs.

<p>Calling Up Reservists to Enlist, Greece Prepares to Defend Itself</p>
<p>Athens: Well-informed sources here, commenting on the entry of German troops into Romania, asserted that if Greece encounters a surprise invasion by the Axis powers, it will use all its military power to prepare for self-defense. (13th International News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Greek Capital: Greek Prime Minister Metaxas has now signed a decree to continue to call up reservists to enlist. It is believed that the decree will be announced next week, and then three levels of reservists will be mobilized. (13th Haitong dispatch)</p>
<p>Greek Capital: It is said that King George II of Greece met with Rear Admiral Santalari, Chief of Naval Staff, to hear a report on the Greek Navy's preparations for war and the navy's defense capabilities. It is reported that the King also met with the Undersecretary of Defense, Patimas, for a long conversation. (13th Haitong dispatch)</p>
<h3>Assisting in Training the Romanian Army: German General Staff Arrives in Bucharest. Led by Hansen Speidel. 20,000 German Troops Arrive Continuously in Romania.</h3>
<p>Bucharest: According to the local gazette, the first batch of German troops dispatched to train the Romanian army arrived here yesterday, fully equipped.

Columns of troop trains are visibly passing through Hungarian territory, and many ships are also arriving at ports along the Danube River. Recently, twenty German air force officers, led by Lieutenant General Speidel, also landed at a military airfield outside Bucharest by plane. In the past few days, German pilots and technicians have been arriving in Romania. The Romanian people learned of the German troops' entry into Romanian territory from the gazette published in yesterday's newspapers. On Friday, the Iron Guard fired hundreds of pistol shots at the garden of the residence rented by British military officers, with bullets raining down, hitting the walls, and shattering glass. The bullets came from the neighboring yard. The adjacent house was formerly the residence of Mrs. Lupescu, the mistress of Romanian King Carol. Although the British immediately protested to the Romanian authorities, the Romanian authorities did not stop it, and the Iron Guard continued to fire for a while before stopping. Fortunately, no one was injured. (Reuter's dispatch from the 13th)</p>

German and Romanian flags were hung high at the station, and a guard of honor paid their respects at the station. The military band played the national anthems of Germany and Romania. General Ion Antonescu delivered a welcome speech on behalf of General Antonescu, saying, "The cooperation between the German and Romanian armies at this historically important time gives us great hope for the future. Romania and its army have long admired German military technology, so they are extremely eager to cooperate with Germany. Now that our wish has been fulfilled, we will sincerely establish a firm relationship." The German military delegation replied, "We are extremely grateful for the warm welcome we have received from the Romanian army and people along the way.

To enhance the friendship between the two countries, Germany has agreed to Romania's request and sent a military delegation to come. The first group, led by General Hansen and General Speidel, arrived yesterday. When the delegation passed through Outer Transylvania, the residents there gave them a warm welcome. (Haitong dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>London: Official news agencies in Berlin and Rome simultaneously released explanations from the Axis powers today regarding Germany's entry into Romania. According to the German official news agency, the Romanian people must feel secure in order to engage in social and economic construction in an atmosphere of peace and tranquility. The entry of German troops into Romania is a symbol of German guarantees. They will provide the Romanian army with their acquired experience in technological warfare and assist Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu in building a strong Romanian army. The Italian news agency stated that Romania must consider the possibility of its oil-producing regions being bombed. The normal production of Romanian oil is important for the Axis powers' war effort and Romania's economic life. The entry of German troops into Romania is the result of a complete compromise between Romania and the Axis powers. (Reuter's dispatch from the 13th)</p>

After Friday night, the London area was frequently alarmed the next day. According to the gazette, several locations in the London area were bombed from high altitude by enemy planes on Saturday morning. Several bombs also fell in the areas of Kent and Sussex.

As for the private belongings found in the rubble, they will be preserved by local authorities for the original owners to claim. Useless debris will be used to fill holes or dumped into the sea.

<h3>Soviet Red Army Changes Training Methods: Combat Exercises Underway</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Truth Daily commented that the current exercises of the Red Army and Navy are still in progress. This exercise shows the efforts of the Red Army and Navy to enhance their strength. The Second Imperialist War, in which the world's largest capitalist countries participated, has given us new insights in military technology. The Red Army is the most well-prepared army in the world. In order to maintain this position, the Red Army should carefully study the experience of this war. Based on the experience of recent battles, the Red Army has greatly changed its military training methods. Attention should be paid to the joint actions of infantry, artillery, tanks, and the air force. Artillery should first destroy the enemy's defenses, and then tanks and infantry should advance. In short, all training should be based on realistic wartime scenarios and comply with wartime operations. This is a special feature of the Red Army's exercises in 1940. In the future, the authorities will definitely train Red Army personnel based on this point. The current exercises are about to end, but winter war exercises will continue, so that the needs of modern warfare can become the basis for military training. (Telegraph from the 13th)</p>

<h3>Former U.S. Army Chief of Staff Advocates Timely Aid to Britain: Telegram to Aid Britain Committee</h3>
<p>Manila: Former U.S. Army Chief of Staff and current Philippine military advisor, General MacArthur, recently sent a telegram to Mr. White of the American Keep America Out of War Committee, stating that the issue of whether you will continue to aid Britain and safeguard civilization has come to us. To solicit my opinion, I can summarize the history of military failures in two words: missing the moment. Knowing the enemy's poisonous schemes and the nation's crisis too late, preparing for war, uniting for resistance, and providing aid to allies too late are all reasons for defeat. Victory in war is not mysterious; it all lies in gathering superior military force in a timely manner. The secret of victors in history lies in careful planning to subdue the enemy. The Axis powers have repeatedly been victorious in this war, and their way lies in this. If the United States does not understand the importance of timing and allows history to record the United States missing the moment again, it would be the biggest strategic mistake. The aid that our country's leaders deem appropriate should be carried out at the same time as Britain's efforts, so that the English-speaking people of the world will not be divided in the slightest. If each exerts its strength and unites with each other, the weaknesses of being alone will naturally disappear. The time cannot be lost; do not leave behind the grief of being too late. Start planning today; do not wait for tomorrow. (Reuter's dispatch from the 13th)</p>

<p>Second Notice To Be Issued Within Days</p>
<p>After the U.S. Consulate in this city issued a notice last week urging American men and women and children with no tasks to evacuate, American residents living in the Hongkou area have registered with the U.S. Consulate, determined to evacuate. It is learned that the U.S. Consulate will issue a second notice next week, urging all American women and children in Shanghai to evacuate, with the exception of American men in Shanghai who have businesses and tasks. The U.S. garrison in Shanghai will also not be evacuated at present.</p>
<p>Commercial Firms Subsidize Staff Members' Travel Expenses</p>
<p>Most American nationals in this city have received the U.S. Consulate's notice to prepare for evacuation, and a small number have not been able to deliver it immediately due to unknown addresses. It is also confirmed that important American commercial firms in this city have received notices from their U.S. headquarters, advising their staff to evacuate their family members and subsidize their travel expenses. The content of this notice is said to be the same as that issued by the Mobil headquarters. Regarding ships, there is a severe shortage, but the U.S. Mail Steamship Company has been ordered to send the two largest U.S. merchant ships, the Washington and the Manhattan, to the Far East to assist in transporting evacuated Americans back home.</p>
<p>Japanese Residents in This City Panic</p>
<p>According to what foreign businessmen know, Japanese residents in this city are very panicked about the strong stance taken by the United States, especially Japanese merchants, as they are also self-aware. Some Japanese residents feel extremely difficult about the future of the Sino-Japanese war. If a U.S.-Japan war breaks out, the future of Japan is truly unimaginable. This kind of panic among Japanese residents is also very prevalent among Japanese personnel in some international organizations.</p>
<p>To Settle the European Situation, First Settle the Far East</p>
<p>Since the U.S. government has taken concrete actions with a strong stance in recent days, the attitude of Japanese official circles has softened. Some say that the situation may be easing, but this is not very optimistic among some foreign diplomats who lean towards democratic countries. According to the observations of a certain foreign diplomat, Japan must collude with Germany and Italy to the end, otherwise its diplomacy will become more isolated, but if it colludes with Germany and Italy, it cannot help but speak out and support Germany and Italy, and stand against Britain and the United States. The sudden softening of the Japanese attitude a few days ago was to quietly wait for the expression of Berlin and Rome, and according to the actual overall situation, if Britain and the United States want to stabilize the European situation, they must first defeat Japan, the weakest link in the Axis powers, and then deal with Europe. This is the best policy.</p>
<p>Japanese National Defense Relies on the United States</p>
<p>A reporter once asked a certain economic authority about the effects that U.S. economic sanctions against Japan could produce. According to him, a U.S. embargo against Japan at this time is a golden opportunity, because after the outbreak of the European war, Japan's required national defense and heavy industry products have completely relied on the United States for supply. Before the war, all aircraft parts, military equipment, vehicles, machinery, spare parts, and other items could still be imported from Germany in part. After the war broke out, the source was cut off. If the United States prohibits exports, Japan's national defense equipment and industrial construction will be hit immediately.</p>
<p>Great Power to Stabilize the World</p>
<p>The abundance of the United States' resource reserves is inherently unique, and the creativity of its people is no less than that of the Germanic peoples, so its manpower and material resources are unparalleled in the world. In addition, the natural resources of South America are sufficient for the United States to use, so it has the great power to stabilize the world, which is by no means an exaggeration. The United States' coal and gasoline production accounts for 60% of the world's total, and the United States' production of iron sand, iron ore, steel, copper, zinc, aluminum, and other important raw materials ranks first in the world. The manufacturing of vehicles and aircraft is also better than Germany's.</p>
<p>Economic Sanctions Are the Best Opportunity</p>
<p>Japan's previous arrogance towards the United States and its subsequent compliance are entirely due to its fear of the United States' manpower and material resources. Its threatening noises are based on the assumption that the United States may not be willing to shed blood. Therefore, it is hoped that the U.S. government and the public will know themselves and their enemies, resolutely implement economic sanctions, and not be intimidated by empty threats. The earlier the sanctions are implemented, the fewer opportunities there will be for the navy to shed blood, and the Pacific will be peaceful sooner.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Landed Outside Xiangshan Port Without Success: Fired More Than 200 Shells, Also Used Machine Guns to Strafe</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang provincial organizations in Shanghai received the following telegram from eastern Zhejiang: (1) At 10:30 AM on the 12th, five Japanese warships anchored on the Hengshan sea off Xiangshan Port suddenly opened fire on the shore with more than 40 shells. Until 5:45 PM, two Japanese warships suddenly sailed into the sea off Hutou Ferry and anchored, with no abnormal movements. (2) At 1:56 PM, a Japanese warship on the Hengshan sea lowered three small motorboats and patrolled back and forth on the sea, and strafed Hengshan with machine guns. At 2:12 PM, the boats fled back to their original ship. (3) At 4:20 PM on the 12th, the Japanese warship on the Hengshan sea suddenly opened fire blindly on the shore with more than 240 shells, with four shells landing at Hutou Ferry, destroying four houses, three shells landing on Dajiao Bank, destroying five houses, and two shells landing near Hengshan x x, with no losses. The rest all landed on wasteland. (4) The Japanese warship anchored on the Longshan sea opened fire on the Longshan coast with 17 shells at 12:36 PM, with the shells landing on beaches and sand, with no losses.</p>
<h3>French Concession Police Will Mediate the Water and Electricity Workers' Strike Again: Engine Room Work Will Not Be Disrupted</h3>
<p>Since the French Concession Water and Electricity Company's workers' strike caused the suspension of public transportation the day before yesterday, the French Concession police's political affairs department believes that the stalemate of this strike has a profound impact on social security and urban prosperity, and it is now heard that it will conduct mediation again, and plans to invite both labor and management to hold negotiations within days. It is heard that the striking workers, after a meeting in a certain place in Nanshi the day before yesterday afternoon, in addition to insisting on the original sixteen conditions and two new conditions, added the condition that temporary short-term workers will be given half a month's severance pay by the management when they resign, and wages will be paid for Sundays and holidays. It is heard that the management has expressed that the vehicle department can obtain the same treatment as the mechanical department with regard to the increase in rice subsidies, but the content of the sixteen conditions currently insisted on by the labor side has nothing to do with the interests of the mechanical department. Yesterday, due to the Sunday holiday, the labor side did not send representatives to visit the political affairs department authorities, nor did it hold a meeting. It is also learned that the parts of the Water and Electricity Company currently participating in the strike are the vehicle department, the mechanical department, and the engine room department, while the workers in the electrical department and the water department are still working as usual, and the management has rehired more than fifty White Russian workers to fill the engine room work, everything is prepared, so the water and electricity supply in the French Concession will definitely not be interrupted. Yesterday, the security at the Water and Electricity Company's main plant on Rue Lupan was still very tight.</p>
<h3>Impending Reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road: Shanghai Merchants Rejoice, Anticipating Active Domestic Sales of Shanghai Goods; Thorough Measures in Place to Prevent Bombing; Southwest-Bound Mail to Be Routed Via Rangoon</h3>
<p>Following the temporary closure of the Yunnan-Burma Road by the British side in mid-July, a period of three months has elapsed. The term expires on the 17th of this month, and the British government has decided to reopen it on the 18th. Merchants from all walks of life, both Chinese and foreign, are encouraged by this news. Despite Japan's various obstructions and protests, they ultimately failed to shake the British government's resolute confidence. A certain industrialist commented that since the Japanese army blockaded the Yunnan-Vietnam Road, followed by the coastal ports of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, which were also sealed off, China's foreign trade and domestic transportation have inevitably suffered some impact. However, the imminent reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road means that various raw materials and armaments from Britain and the United States can be transported through this route, and goods from Shanghai destined for provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi can also be transferred through this road without restrictions. Therefore, the reopening of this road is extremely important.</p>
<p>Caution Against Bombing</p>
<p>Since entering Vietnam, the Japanese army has occupied various buildings and important airfields, using them as bases for their air force. Bombing and destruction of the reopened Burma Road are naturally expected. The government has thorough plans in place to address this. Judging from the previous successes of repairing railways like Guangzhou-Kowloon and Nanning-Hanoi as soon as they were bombed, there will be no significant losses. Road workers and engineers are stationed along the entire road, and they will immediately set out to repair any damage caused by bombing, ensuring that vehicles will not be stopped due to road damage.</p>
<p>Returning Goods from Vietnam</p>
<p>Regarding the domestic sales situation, Mr. X mentioned that since the blockade of Shanghai, Vietnam, and various coastal ports, domestic sales of goods have almost completely disappeared. Although transportation between Shanghai and Hong Kong remains smooth, transportation to ports is intermittent. While goods from Shanghai can be transported to Hong Kong, whether they can be transferred onward is a problem. Recently, the Vietnamese government has agreed to return goods that were imported but remained within Vietnamese territory to Hong Kong, which is what the industrial and commercial sectors have been hoping for day and night. Although China and France had previously signed a treaty stipulating that goods destined for foreign countries or inland areas, transiting through Vietnam, would be released without detention, the Chinese diplomatic missions stationed there had already withdrawn, making it impossible to negotiate locally. Now, due to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' protest, the Vietnamese government has granted permission, which is a great blessing for merchants.</p>
<p>Mail Route Via Burma</p>
<p>Since the Yunnan-Burma Road is scheduled to reopen on the 18th of this month, the Shanghai Post Office has received a telegram from the General Post Office, deciding to route mail to the southwest through this line, entering through Rangoon and transporting it to the interior via the Yunnan-Burma Road. Subsequently, the postal delivery rate should increase compared to before. As for airmail, it will still be transported to Hong Kong and then transferred by airplane. Furthermore, since the outbreak of war in Vietnam, more than 30,000 pieces of mail had been stranded in Haiphong. The General Post Office is currently negotiating with the Vietnamese government for their release, and some have already been rushed out of Vietnam.</p>
<p>Shanghai Goods to Be Shipped</p>
<p>With the Yunnan-Burma Road scheduled to reopen on the 18th of this month, import and export firms in Shanghai are actively preparing to transport goods accumulated in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Haiphong to the interior through this route. The ships that recently set sail from the port, such as Shen'ai, Jinan, Haisui, and Qingyuan, which set sail yesterday morning, are all heavily loaded, mostly with foreign imported goods transferred through Hong Kong, awaiting the opportunity to be transported in via the Yunnan-Burma Road. Therefore, the entire cargo transport is gradually showing signs of activity.</p>
<h3>Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau Plans to Establish a Savings Network Within the Year</h3>
<p>The Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau has achieved considerable success in handling remittance business through years of effort. The number of bureaus handling savings and remittances currently totals thousands, but this only accounts for one-third of the total number of post offices in the country, which is more than three thousand. Now, in order to rapidly popularize the financial network and intensify the promotion of national savings for national construction, the National Government has instructed the Ministry of Communications to open savings businesses in all post offices and postal agencies with the potential to absorb deposits within the year, in order to absorb private idle funds and enrich the strength of resistance and national construction. At least one thousand postal savings personnel will be recruited and dispatched to various locations to provide services in the short term. The procedures for handling business should be adapted to local customs and prioritize the convenience of depositors. The Savings and Remittances Bureau is currently actively working on this, so as to complete the national savings and remittances network as scheduled within the year.</p>
<h3>Banking and Money Industry Funds Shift Inward, Decides to Cooperate with the "Four Banks"; First, Establish More Branches in the Interior; Special Caution in Lending in Shanghai</h3>
<p>After a sharp increase in deposits in Shanghai's banks and money houses, the banks and money houses, realizing that reducing deposit interest rates could not solve the current crisis, selected the most reliable collateral for appropriate loans to avoid wasting interest. At the same time, they prepared to maintain 55% of the total deposit amount at all times. Because there is an extreme lack of proper investment channels in Shanghai, the problem of fund utilization has become increasingly serious, creating an unprecedented wave of speculation. After repeated consideration, the banks and money houses decided to transfer the surplus funds to the southwest, northwest, and inland areas, and cooperate with the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank of China to complete the mission of construction and development in the interior, indirectly curbing speculation in various underground markets in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Internal Transfer of Funds</p>
<p>In the past, less attention was paid to the finance of the southwest and northwest regions. Since the authorities have been steadily advancing in transportation, and highways and railways have been completed one after another, the industrial and commercial sectors are becoming increasingly prosperous. The authorities are providing various conveniences for investment in the interior. Therefore, major commercial banks in Shanghai are making every effort to establish branches in the interior to seek development to the greatest extent possible: (1) investing in land reclamation, water conservancy construction, and agricultural development; (2) investing in national defense production and mineral development; (3) investing in public transportation undertakings; (4) investing in economic construction undertakings; (5) investing in joint production and sales undertakings.</p>
<p>Increasing Reserves</p>
<p>Regarding various industrial and commercial loans within the Shanghai concession area, the banks and money houses have decided on principles. Credit loans are certainly out of the question. Except for money houses that grant loans to old customers as appropriate, banks completely refuse to undertake large-scale commodity mortgages. Moreover, fearing social criticism and suspicion of assisting hoarding and manipulation, they are extremely cautious in identifying and verifying commodity mortgages, requiring that their use be normal, so as to avoid being misunderstood by society on the one hand and not betraying the purpose of supporting industry and commerce on the other. However, in order to suit the environment during this time of resistance against Japan, they have increased reserves to cope with the situation.</p>
<h3>Gong Bida's Life Can Be Saved, Surgery Proceeding Well</h3>
<p>Gong Bida, Deputy Inspector of the Chinese Constabulary of the Louza Central Police Station, was shot by a thug while returning to his residence from the police station at noon on the 8th. As he arrived at the entrance of Rihui Lane on Jin Shenfu Road, he was ambushed by a thug who pulled out a gun. He was shot twice in the back, but neither bullet exited. Gong fell to the ground after being wounded, and the assailant fled. He was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment in an ambulance. It is reported that after Gong entered the hospital, his condition was critical and he lost too much blood, so the doctor did not perform surgery. It wasn't until the morning of the day before yesterday that his condition showed slight improvement, so surgery was performed to remove one bullet. Another bullet will take more time to remove. However, the surgery is proceeding well, and his life may be saved.</p>
<h3>British Deputy Inspector Resigns to Serve the Country, Scheduled to Enlist in Malaya on the 14th, Police Officers Host a Farewell Banquet and Present Souvenirs</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, British Deputy Inspector Gault of the Xinzha Road Police Station has served in the Public Works Department Police for 14 years and has made considerable achievements. He recently resigned and is scheduled to leave Shanghai with his family on the 14th of this month to enlist in Malaya and serve the country. The police officers of the Xinzha Road Police Station held a private gathering at the police station yesterday (the 12th) at noon to bid him farewell and presented him with three gifts, including a watch, and raised funds to donate to the British War Fund. Gault previously served in the British Army. In July 1926, he joined the Public Works Department Police, serving in the Criminal Division and the Political Division. He was also once responsible for intelligence matters at the Police Department.</p>
<h3>After Britain and the United States Adopted Tough Policies, the Situation in the Far East Eased; Comments from British Commentator Woodhead</h3>
<p>British commentator Woodhead commented on the situation in the Far East in the English-language Greater Shanghai Weekly: "Last week was one of the most tense weeks in the Far East, the reason being the talks between Konoe and Matsuoka with the United States. Japan has actually notified the United States that unless the United States stops aiding China, does not oppose the 'New Order in Greater Asia', and cooperates with Japan to create a new order, Japan has no other way to go but to engage in war. When the US election campaign was at its most intense, the purpose of Japan's threat was to create division in the United States' opinions and prevent it from making decisions. The US government was not shocked by this threat at all, and is preparing to pay Japan's final move. The embargo is increasing, and naval reservists are also being called up. The US fleet and troops stationed in Hawaii are being strengthened. At the same time, overseas Chinese who do not have important tasks in the Far East are being advised to withdraw from China, Japan, and Vietnam. The attitude of the US official and press commentary has been very clear."</p>
<p>Empty Threats, Complete Failure</p>
<p>The United States considers it an intolerable insult to change its policies due to Japan's demands. The United States' response to Konoe and Matsuoka's threats, and Britain's announcement of the opening of the Yunnan-Burma Road, have a calming effect on Japan. The roaring attitude of the Japanese press has greatly decreased, and the Foreign Ministry's explanation is also mitigating the trend of this crisis becoming serious. What surprised Japan was that the United States lightly regarded the threat to Tokyo. Although this matter is not optimistic, the danger of an immediate war between Japan and the United States, although not completely resolved, can be said to have eased somewhat when the author drafted this article. Even the provocation of opening the Yunnan-Burma Road to Britain will not lead to a serious conflict, unless some irresponsible Japanese pilots mistakenly recognize Hong Kong and Burma as Chinese territory, or mistake British and American mail ships as targets for shooting practice.</p>
<p>The Plight of Small European Countries</p>
<p>As for the military moves in Europe, both sides are still limited to air raids. Neither Britain nor Germany has solved how to deal with night raids. However, the British Royal Air Force has focused its attention on military targets, constantly inflicting great damage on German seaports, airfields, invasion bases, oil refineries, armaments factories, and railway centers. The British Royal Air Force's visit to Berlin is enough to make the German government quickly evacuate children. To what extent the Axis powers' conspiracy in the Balkans will go remains to be seen. Germany and Italy are causing the disintegration of Romania in order to win the sympathy of the Romanian people. Now, they are using military occupation of its remaining territory to express their friendship. The new European order does not care about the rights and claims of small countries. These countries are being whipped and enjoying "new freedom" under the Axis powers. China has been betrayed by France, and Kunming has suffered severely damaged air raids. How do the French people feel about the simple words in the letter attached to the paper umbrella presented by the Chinese community in Kunming to Marshal Pétain, saying: "Japan has bombed the cities of Yunnan. Thank you for your kindness. There is an ancient Chinese saying: 'Prepare for a rainy day.' Therefore, we specially present you with a Chinese paper umbrella."?</p>

<p>Japanese Plainclothes Police Search in the Eastern District of the French Concession; Search Conducted from Dongxin Bridge to the Bund in Conjunction with Detectives from the Police Station</p>
<p>Starting at 6:00 PM yesterday, the Japanese side requested the French Concession authorities to dispatch several Chinese and Western detectives to conduct searches at all major exits along the border of Avenue Edward VII from Dongxin Bridge to the Bund in conjunction with Japanese plainclothes police, with two personnel stationed at each location. The Japanese plainclothes police began to withdraw around 10:00 PM. It was later learned that nothing was found.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Set Up Sentries in the Western District of Shanghai</p>
<p>The Haig Road area in the western part of the French Concession has always been patrolled by French Concession police. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 11th), four Japanese military police suddenly set up sentry posts at the intersection of Mackenzie Road and Haig Road, strictly checking pedestrians, creating a tense atmosphere. They began to withdraw on the evening of the 12th. This is the first time since August 13th that the Japanese army has searched the border area of the French Concession in the western district.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Crushes a Man to Death; Autopsy Scheduled for Today; Relatives to Be Notified to Identify the Body</h3>
<p>At 1:03 PM yesterday, a Route 9 public bus owned by the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, driven by driver Lu Hengchang, No. 117 (23 years old, from Yangzhou, residing at No. 28, Kangle Village, Connaught Road), was traveling east on Avenue Foch towards the Zhaofeng Garden in western Shanghai. When it reached the western end of the intersection of Weihaiwei Road, near No. 865, Model Village, an unnamed man, about 30 years old, wearing a gray serge long gown, was crossing the road from north to south. When he reached the center of the road, the driver swerved the front of the bus to the south side of the French Concession boundary line to avoid him. Unexpectedly, in a state of panic, the man ran in front of the bus, and the bus was unable to brake in time, knocking the man down and crushing his head, killing him instantly. The Jing'an Temple Police Station was notified and dispatched detectives to investigate. The body was transported to the corpse examination office on Jiaozhou Road. As the incident occurred within the French Concession boundary line, the French Police Station was notified and sent detectives to investigate the scene and took the driver back to the police station for questioning. The body was transferred to the Tongren Supplementary Yuan Branch for a corpse examination, and the court will be requested to send personnel to inspect it today, and the relatives of the deceased will be notified. The deceased had short hair, cut in a Yuanping style, wearing a gray long gown, with a white short shirt and trousers inside, a gray cloth short shirt, old white-gray cloth leggings, gray Western socks, and wool-lined leather shoes. A notebook was found on his person, but there was no name or address. It only contained the telephone numbers of several well-known incense and candle shops such as Wang Dayou and Wang Dasheng, suggesting that he was a salesman or broker in the incense and candle business. If there are any family members or relatives, they can go to the Tongren Supplementary Yuan Branch for a corpse examination to identify and claim the body. The deceased had a lot of dark hair on his chest and abdomen.</p>
<h3>After Li Yuying's Death, So Many Disputes; Tailor Sues for Labor and Material Costs</h3>
<p>Li Yuying, a female nurse from Fujian who worked as the head nurse at the Franco-Chinese Sanatorium on Rue de Pushi, died suddenly in her bedroom on the night of June 10th, causing various disputes. Lu Zhenqing, the superintendent of the hospital, and Lin Zhengliang, a doctor, were prosecuted by the prosecutor of the Special No. 2 Court for the crime of forging certificates because they did not follow the regulations of the concession hospital to report the corpse to the police station for inspection, and instead signed a certificate stating that she died of a stroke. The first instance ruled Lu and Lin not guilty. Subsequently, the prosecutor handling the case appealed to the High Court Branch. Furthermore, because the deceased left behind more than ten thousand yuan in cash, clothing, etc., and the hospital did not hand it over to the deceased's relatives, the deceased's father, Li Shizhen, filed a lawsuit against Lu Zhenqing in the Special No. 2 Court to preserve evidence. In addition, the China Funeral Home filed two cases in the Special No. 2 Court against Li Shizhen, seeking to recover more than 2,000 yuan for the deceased's funeral expenses. While these were being investigated, accounts were examined, and witnesses were summoned, Bao Arong, a tailor on Avenue Albert, who made clothes for the deceased Li Yuying and purchased clothing materials, had an outstanding balance of 82 yuan for labor and materials before her death. Two pieces of clothing were still at Bao's shop. After Li's death, her father took them away, but he delayed paying the outstanding labor and material costs. Therefore, Bao Arong sued Li Shizhen, the deceased's father, in the civil court of the Special No. 2 Court, seeking a judgment for compensation. The case was heard by Judge Chen Ziguan the day before yesterday, who summoned both parties for trial. The hearing was adjourned, and the judgment is pending.</p>
<h3>Boiler Operator Training Class, Registration Tonight</h3>
<p>In order to save costs for hot water equipment in various apartments, the Industrial Section of the Public Works Department has decided to set up a boiler operator training class to specifically train boiler operators hired by various apartments located east of Jing'an Temple to the Bund, teaching them safe and economical methods for burning boilers. It is learned that the section is scheduled to conduct registration for trainees at the Health Sub-Office at No. 340 Hankou Road at 7:00 PM tonight (the 14th). Apartment owners who wish to send their boiler operators to attend the class should instruct them to report to the aforementioned location on time.</p>
<h3>Russian Woman Feigns Fainting, Robbers Unable to Plunder Fully; Company Suffers Loss of Several Thousand Yuan; Robbers Only Make Off with Over Two Hundred Yuan</h3>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, Heng Shi Bao Company in the Central Arcade on Nanjing Road was robbed yesterday (the 12th). Fortunately, a Russian female employee named Moxina was quick-witted, which allowed the company to suffer a loss of several thousand yuan. The incident occurred at 4:55 PM, after Heng Shi Bao Company had closed for business, with only the Russian woman and one Chinese employee remaining in the office,</p>
<p>Work Not Yet Finished</p>
<p>Suddenly, four robbers armed with handguns broke in. One robber pulled the curtains, and the remaining robbers used ropes to tie up the Chinese employee. Then, they forced the Russian woman to take out the safe key, but to no avail. The robbers then searched on their own and finally found the key in a desk drawer. They forced the Russian woman to sit down, place her hands on her knees, and tied her hands with ropes. Seizing the opportunity, they robbed the Russian woman of her diamond ring and gold watch. The robbers</p>
<p>Opened the Safe</p>
<p>And discovered that another key was needed to open the cash box inside. Seeing this, the Russian woman pretended to faint to avoid being forced to take out the key. The robbers were unable to open the cash box and only robbed 286 yuan before escaping from the back door. If the robbers had forced the Russian woman to take out the cash box key, the dozens of yuan contained in the box would have fallen into their hands.</p>
<h3>A Gardener Stabbed to Death in a Westerner's Garden; Gardener Previously Captured a Thief and Beat Him Severely; This Attack Appears to Be Revenge by the Thief</h3>
<p>A stabbing assassination occurred in the garden of a Westerner's residence at No. 210 Gordon Road, Shanghai, at approximately 4:00 AM yesterday morning. The victim was the gardener of the residence, named Yu Lun, who was stabbed six times, all in vital areas, and died on the spot. The assailant was a thief who fled after the incident. The details were learned after investigation. Yu Lun was 50 years old, a local, and had been working as a gardener and gatekeeper in the Westerner's residential garden for many years, earning a monthly salary of 15 yuan. Because he was loyal and diligent, he was deeply favored by the Westerner. However, the area is remote, and thefts often occur. The garden of the residence is also often coveted by thieves. There was one instance when a thief broke in to steal property and was captured by Yu, who beat him before releasing him, causing the thief to harbor resentment and develop the idea of harming him. At approximately 4:00 AM yesterday morning, Yu was sleeping soundly in the gatehouse as usual when the thief took the opportunity to sneak in and attack with a sharp knife, stabbing Yu all over. He was stabbed twice in the head, twice in the left and right hands, once in the waist, and once in the right shoulder. Blood splattered everywhere, and he was barely breathing. Seeing that he had achieved his goal, the assailant fled. It wasn't until dawn that he was discovered by other servants of the residence. Unfortunately, Yu had already died from his injuries. They reported it to the owner, who then reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate the scene and took footprints and fingerprints at the scene of the incident. Yu's body was transported to the corpse examination office on Jiaozhou Road, and the Special No. 1 Court was requested to send personnel to inspect and coffin the body. The police station has ordered police officers to pursue and investigate the escaped suspect in order to deter criminals.</p>

<h3>A Resident Robbed on Rue de Pushi Last Night; One Thief Intercepted, Original Stolen Goods Recovered</h3>
<p>A resident of the Huang surname, a rice merchant from Ningbo, residing at No. X, Lane 240, Rue de Pushi, was suddenly attacked by three robbers at approximately 7:30 PM last night. Two of them were armed with handguns. They entered through the back door and broke into the upstairs room, warning them not to make a sound. They robbed them of 3,500 yuan in national currency. As they were escaping with the stolen goods, a lodger surnamed Chen on the second-floor rear building followed them and reported them to the street police on duty at the entrance of No. 80, Avenue Petain. One thief was intercepted on the spot, and a portion of the original stolen goods, totaling 2,000 yuan, was recovered. The thief was arrested and taken to the police station for investigation.

<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the weather in China and the Yellow Sea would change from clear to cloudy with winds in no direction. The weather in the East China Sea would change from overcast to cloudy with localized showers. The temperature in Shanghai in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday was a maximum of 80.2 degrees and a minimum of 66.9 degrees. On the same day last year, the maximum was 79.2 degrees and the minimum was 68.9 degrees.</p>
<h3>American Company Has Filed a Lawsuit Over a Two Million Yuan Theft; Believes Ruifeng Company Should Be Responsible; The Thief, Hult, Has Not Yet Been Apprehended</h3>
<p>Swiss Consul General to Shanghai, Fontanel, submitted a memorandum to the Japanese Consul General the day before yesterday (the 11th), requesting cooperation and assistance in arresting the thief, Swiss citizen Hult, due to the fact that the Public Works Department Police's arrest of the thief, Swiss national Hult, was obstructed by the Japanese military police, resulting in the escape of the criminal. According to Police Chief Bainetto of the Public Works Department, he and police officers from the Japanese Consulate went to the Broadway Mansions in Hongkou last Thursday to arrest the thief Hult but were interfered with by Japanese military police who arrived at the scene, so that he could not be arrested. The circumstances of the case are very complicated. Since last Thursday, part of the copper ingots stored in the warehouse of Ruifeng Transport Company, worth US$100,000, has been moved. This batch of copper ingots belongs to the American company Maosheng Foreign Company. It was used as a payment when the Chinese government purchased machinery from the United States in 1937, and Hult claimed that the transaction was illegal. He believed that this batch of copper ingots was "contraband," so he represented the Japanese army in moving them away. The Maosheng Foreign Company denied Hult's claims the day before yesterday, and the company filed a civil lawsuit against the Ruifeng Transport Company, which should be responsible for the storage, in the American court.</p>

<h3>Western Union First Division Football Match: Tung Wah Achieves a Victorious Start, Defeating Jewish Recreation Club 4-3, After Trailing 1-2 in the First Half</h3>
<p>The second act of the Western Union First Division football match took place yesterday at the Recreation Ground between Tung Wah and the Jewish Recreation Club. The crowd gathered, exceeding three thousand, creating a grand spectacle. In the first half, the Jewish Recreation Club took the lead with 2-1. However, Tung Wah's fortunes turned, resulting in a 2-2 tie, and ultimately, they triumphed with a score of 4-3. Tung Wah had numerous opportunities but failed to capitalize on them. Although the Jewish Recreation Club was a Second Division team, they were newly promoted this year and scored twice in the first ten minutes. Tung Wah, amidst a difficult struggle, eventually overcame their opponents.</p>
<p>Tung Wah Team</p>
<p>Chin But-ko</p>
<p>Lee Ning, Chong Yau-yan</p>
<p>Leung Shu-tong, Tsoi Sing-sam, Hon Lung-hoi</p>
<p>Ng Ping-ho, Wong Hak-hau, Tai Lun-king, Ng Ki-cheung, Fei Chun-wa</p>
<p>Jewish Recreation Club Team</p>
<p>Cohen</p>
<p>Reisberg, Kremer</p>
<p>S. Shawi, Meyer, Donasfer</p>
<p>Jacob, Lawson-Hui, Abbott, Larent, Schamroth</p>
<p>Two Goals Conceded in the First Ten Minutes</p>
<p>The Jewish Recreation Club kicked off first, maneuvering in midfield without much progress for about two minutes. Suddenly, Tung Wah advanced from the right, bombarding the Jewish defense. Unfortunately, Tai Lun-king and Ng Ki-cheung missed their targets. The Jewish team launched a counterattack, and in the fifth minute, Schamroth crossed from the side, and Lawson-Hui headed the ball into the net. At that moment, the sun was shining, and Schamroth's cross fell from a high position, dazzling Chin But-ko, allowing Lawson-Hui to score. After conceding a goal, Tung Wah intensified their attack, but due to being overly hasty, they found it difficult to penetrate. The Jewish team, with their morale high, seized the opportunity to attack repeatedly. Five minutes later, the Tung Wah penalty area was besieged again, with enemy players crisscrossing in front of the goal. Jacob, from about twenty yards near the goal, volleyed another ball into the net amidst the chaos. Tung Wah lost two key positions in the first ten minutes. Tai Lun-king, in a fit of anger, finally recovered a goal four minutes later. After that, both sides defended very tightly, and the actions were extremely intense. Jewish Recreation Club's right-back Kremer even dislocated his right arm due to the intensity of the battle and had to retire, leaving them to play with only ten men for no less than twenty minutes. Tung Wah's luck was not good, and many attacks failed by a hair's breadth. The first half ended with Tung Wah trailing 1-2.</p>
<p>Turning the Tide, Coming from Behind</p>
<p>After the lemon break, both teams resumed the match. Tung Wah turned the tide. Just three minutes into the second half, Tai Lun-king penetrated the enemy's line, received a pass from Ng Ki-cheung, and volleyed the ball into the net, tying the score at 2-2. From then on, Tung Wah became increasingly impressive, and the Jewish Recreation Club was helpless. Lee Ning and Chong Yau-yan were like two iron gates. At that time, the situation on the front line was tense, and Fei Chun-wa had to withdraw due to cramps. Ng Ki-cheung was reassigned to the right wing and returned to the field five minutes later. At this time, Tung Wah's morale was high, and the Jewish Recreation Club retreated to a corner. All the attacks were controlled by Tung Wah. In the twenty-fifth minute, the Jewish Recreation Club's right inside-forward Kremer fouled Tai in the penalty area, resulting in a penalty kick. Tsoi Sing-sam took the shot, which was as fast as a cannonball. Tung Wah then took the lead with 3-2. Tung Wah's attack remained strong. There was a wonderful link-up between Ng Ki-cheung and Tai. Tai crossed to the center, a perfect position, but Fei Chun-wa was slightly slower due to the aftereffects of the cramps, resulting in a missed opportunity. However, one minute later (33rd minute), Fei broke through and crossed in front of the goal. Tai rushed forward and slid in at the eighteen-yard mark, hitting the upper left corner, establishing the winning score of 4-3. However, Fei aggravated his old injury due to excessive effort and had to withdraw again. The Jewish Recreation Club launched a desperate counterattack, and finally, in the fortieth minute, Tsoi's interception failed, allowing Frallent to shovel the ball into the net from fifteen yards, hitting the crossbar and bouncing into the net. It was too fast and sharp, and But-ko was unable to save it. In the next five minutes, the entire Tung Wah team retreated to defend, ending the game with a score of 4-3. Tung Wah celebrated a triumphant victory.</p>

<h3>Changes and Characteristics of the Shanghai Exchange Market Since "May 2nd"</h3>
<p>— Shi Yiwen</p>
<p>After the retreat of the National Army to the west, the government was unable to exercise its authority in Shanghai, and its financial control over Shanghai was also weakened. In March 1938, the government implemented foreign exchange control to protect China's wartime finance. However, due to the special circumstances of the concessions, the underground market's speculative activities could not be banned, and the Central Bank's foreign exchange control buying and selling system could not be maintained. The official exchange rate existed only in form, and the underground market rate actually dominated the exchange market. Since then, the exchange market has become increasingly uncontrolled, the market rate has fluctuated dramatically, and those who buy and sell foreign exchange are all aimed at speculation and profit. This situation is certainly extremely unfavorable to the entire wartime economy. However, since "May 2nd," the situation seems to have changed. Although the market rate still fluctuates, the pressure on the exchange market from speculators has been greatly reduced due to the government's success in maintaining the legal tender policy. So generally speaking, the exchange market after "May 2nd" is more stable than before. The following will discuss the changes in the exchange market after "May 2nd" and the recent situation, as well as some particularly special issues.</p>
<p>Changes in the Exchange Market After "May 2nd"</p>
<p>The "May 2nd" foreign exchange meeting's resumption of the suspension of the sale of foreign exchange was originally an economic defense strategy of the government. Its purpose was to strike at the Japanese economic offensive (the war-supporting policy) on the one hand, and to strike at speculative activities that sacrificed national and ethnic interests on the other. At the time, we also described it this way, but speculators did not view it that way. They still followed their past experience, believing that the longer the war lasted, the more the legal tender exchange rate would fall. Therefore, despite the already tight market rate, their scavenging work was still very vigorous. But in the end, they failed. In less than three weeks, the exchange rate returned to the level before "May 2nd." Previously, speculators always earned more and lost less, but only this time did they suffer heavy blows, with some going bankrupt and others disappearing or committing suicide. This trend also affected other speculative markets, and the entire Shanghai market declined as a result.</p>
<p>After "May 2nd," Shanghai's various speculative markets were very depressed, and the exchange market also changed very little. In early July, in order to fight for the right to export materials from the occupied areas and the free areas, the government revised the commercial exchange rate to four and a half (originally seven). This measure is obviously the same as the "May 2nd" suspension of foreign exchange sales in meaning, and is another strategy of economic defense warfare. However, the speculators, whose wounds had not yet healed, thought it was an opportunity for activity, so they competed to buy and hoard, resulting in the exchange rate being pulled down to about five and a half yuan (it was about six yuan at the end of June). Later (mid-August), due to the blockade of the Yunnan-Vietnam and Yunnan-Burma roads, the withdrawal of British troops, and the Japanese military's threat to Vietnam, a panic psychology formed in the market, and the exchange rate dropped again near the five-yuan mark. In early September, although it rose slightly, the trend was still hovering, and people's hearts were still tight. It was not until the end of September, when the Sino-US loan was successful, that it soared to beyond the five-and-a-half-yuan mark. (Speculators suffered another major blow.)</p>
<p>The main reason for this sudden surge in the exchange market was of course the success of the Sino-US loan. However, we must point out here that the real reason for this surge in the exchange market was not the fact that the loan was successful, but the significance of the loan's success. This significance was particularly evident after the announcement of the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, and played a significant role.</p>
<p>In terms of the loan's facts, the total amount was only 25 million US dollars. Using this amount to maintain the exchange market, we can frankly say that it would not have any effect. Moreover, the nature of this loan was exactly the same as the previous ones. In other words, it was an extension of the previous Sino-US loan agreement, and in fact not a new loan. Therefore, in terms of the nature and facts of this loan, its influence on the exchange market was also limited. This point can also be seen from the actual exchange market situation after the news of the loan's success reached Shanghai. I remember that the news reached the market around noon on September 26. At that time, although people in the market knew that the loan was successful, they did not know the details, so there were many rumors. Therefore, many people were hesitant to sell, and the market rate once rose from 5.3125 yuan to 5.46875 yuan, and finally closed at 5.4062 yuan. (A rise of 0.09375). The next day, the news content was published in various newspapers, and the market rate turned back to 5.375 yuan. This clearly shows that people did not attach much importance to this news. It was not until the news of the Tripartite Pact came (September 27) that people's hearts were stirred, and the exchange market took a sharp turn for the worse, soaring from 5.40625 yuan to 5.625 yuan. (Market rate on September 30)</p>
<p>The Sino-US loan and the Tripartite Pact were originally two different facts, but there was a causal relationship between them. We know that China's loan activities with the United States have been going on for some time. It was not successful before, but it was successful when the Tripartite Pact was about to be announced. This clearly shows the United States' intentions: it will intensify its aid to China, and the United States itself is also determined to participate in the war. Under the display of this significance, people with foreign exchange in hand naturally became panicked, and the loosening of the exchange market was inevitable.</p>
<p>Special Characteristics of the Exchange Market After "May 2nd"</p>
<p>The above is just a general analysis of the changes in the exchange market after "May 2nd" and the recent situation. Now, we would like to discuss several special issues that have appeared in the exchange market after "May 2nd." On the one hand, these special issues can be said to be the special characteristics of the exchange market after "May 2nd," and at the same time, they can also be said to be the reason why the legal tender exchange rate after "May 2nd" has been relatively stable.</p>
<p>First, the one-way decline of the legal tender exchange rate before "May 2nd" was largely the result of speculative activities, but the huge trade deficit was also one of the reasons. Judging from the customs' statistical reports, if the monthly import and export amounts are calculated in foreign exchange, then the total trade deficit for the entire country from January to August this year is 42 million pounds. If this deficit needs to be settled in foreign exchange, then the pressure on the exchange market will be considerable. However, for the current exchange rate, this pressure has not been expressed. Being able to maintain today's exchange rate with such a huge trade deficit is indeed a "mystery." Or some people use the reason of "overseas Chinese remittances" to solve this "mystery," but there were also overseas Chinese remittances in the same period last year, and the amount of the trade deficit was less than this year (41 million pounds), but the exchange rate fell more than this year. We believe that to solve this "mystery," we can only explain it from the potential of legal tender. Because the evolution of the past situation was unpredictable, the amount of legal tender exchanged into foreign exchange for storage or escape abroad was very considerable. (This foreign exchange storage and escape capital are all the potential of legal tender.) Since "May 2nd," because the prospects for the war have become optimistic, the status of legal tender has become more stable, and the past escape capital (including stored foreign exchange) has returned one after another (the increase in Shanghai bank deposits is a counter-evidence), thus offsetting a portion of the huge trade deficit. We have no way to prove this fact from statistics, but we are certain that it is related to the relative stability of the exchange market after "May 2nd."</p>
<p>Second, the speculative activities of any speculator must have a prerequisite, that is, to have speculative funds. If there are not enough funds, even if there is an opportunity for speculation, it may not be possible to proceed. Before "May 2nd," there was a considerable amount of hot money in Shanghai. Therefore, speculators also had to use this hot money to operate. But judging from the situation of exchange drafts, discounts, and bank deposits, there was more hot money after "May 2nd" than before. In terms of the speculative environment, it is more suitable for speculative activities. But in fact, speculators cannot use these large amounts of hot money to make greater threats to the exchange market than before. This phenomenon is obviously due to the fact that speculators were hit after "May 2nd" and did not dare to operate as recklessly as in the past. Therefore, it gave the stability of the exchange market a lot of help.</p>
<p>Third, the past attacks and oppression of the legal tender by the Japanese, and the frequent tightening of the exchange market were also related. Since "May 2nd," the Japanese have deeply felt that the depreciation of the legal tender is also unfavorable to the Japanese, so they have stopped attacking the legal tender and adopted a more realistic policy! On the one hand, they use legal tender, and on the other hand, they strengthen the value of military tickets. This change in the Japanese policy has naturally reduced a major pressure on the exchange market. However, we want to add here that the Japanese change in the policy of attacking the legal tender is not the reason why the exchange market after "May 2nd" can be relatively stable. On the contrary, it is the result of the legal tender's abundant strength and the Japanese knowing that they cannot destroy it.</p>
<p>The Future of the Shanghai Exchange Market</p>
<p>How will the Shanghai exchange market develop in the future? To answer this question, we must examine it from two aspects: first, whether the value of foreign exchange (US dollars or British pounds) itself will change; and second, what the future of legal tender is.</p>
<p>In terms of the first point, whether the value of the US dollar or British pound will change depends on how the situation in the Pacific develops. If there is no change in the Pacific, then the value of the US dollar and British pound will certainly not change in the future. Conversely, if there is a conflict between the United States and Britain and Japan in the Pacific, then Shanghai's transportation and trade relations with the United States and Britain will inevitably be cut off, and it is not difficult to guess who will control the Shanghai market. At this time, there is a question as to whether Shanghai still has a foreign exchange supply and demand relationship. Because the occurrence of the foreign exchange market is originally based on foreign trade relations. Once the trade relationship is cut off, the foreign exchange supply and demand relationship will naturally have no way to occur. Without a foreign exchange supply and demand relationship, the foreign exchange market cannot be established. In this way, even if the value (purchasing power) of the US dollar or British pound remains unchanged in their own country, but because people in Shanghai who hold US dollars or British pounds cannot purchase goods from that country, and no one wants to buy them on the market, then the foreign exchange becomes a property on the books. In other words, it becomes a bad debt that cannot be recovered. When this bad debt can be recovered depends on when the war ends and trade relations are restored. To take a step back, even if the United States and Britain and Japan are waging war in the Pacific, and Shanghai's trade relations with the United States and Britain still exist, because the United States implements foreign exchange control, the external value of the US dollar will inevitably be affected, and the exchange rate of the US dollar against legal tender will naturally fall. This situation has already been significantly manifested in the recent Shanghai exchange market. The United States and Japan have not yet started war, and the situation is already like this. After the official start of the war, the impact will certainly be greater. (The depreciation of the US dollar, British pound, Hong Kong dollar, etc. will also follow the depreciation, which is self-evident)</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of the future of legal tender. If a war breaks out in the Pacific, the value of legal tender will certainly improve (as mentioned above), which is unnecessary to say. If the international situation remains unchanged and the Sino-Japanese war still exists, we can also say with certainty that the value of legal tender will only rise and will not fall. What is the reason?</p>
<p>We feel that the establishment and evolution of the legal tender system is quite symbolic of the development of the Chinese nation in recent years. The life of legal tender is entrusted to the unified foundation of the Chinese nation, so the fate of Chinese legal tender is also completely consistent with the fate of the Chinese nation. If it is determined that the Chinese nation has no future, then there is no point in discussing whether legal tender has value in the future. But the current facts show us that the Chinese people have established the foundation of national liberation through more than three years of hard fighting and countless sacrifices of blood and flesh, which cannot be destroyed by any external force. Therefore, we can conclude that legal tender, which shares the future of the nation, will never have a reason to fall again in the future. On the contrary, due to the exhaustion of the aggressors and the increasingly favorable international situation, the new life of the Chinese nation is constantly strengthening. The future value of legal tender will only develop upwards day by day.</p>

<h3>Financial Review</h3>
<p>— Sheng Kaiqiong</p>
<p>— October 12th —</p>
<p>How Will Foreign Exchange Trends Develop?</p>
<p>At the beginning of September, when foreign exchange tightened, my observation was that the tightness in exchange rates at that time was due to the old bulls and those using rumors and the Vietnam situation to sell their August-term exchange purchased in July. The new bulls hoped to profit from the tightening exchange rates caused by the Vietnam situation. I predicted that the chances of exchange rates easing were greater than the chances of tightening. In fact, in September, apart from the tightest price of the month on the 4th, at £3.4375 and $5.09375, although the market situation fluctuated between tightness and looseness, it generally showed a tendency to hover upwards. However, the changes in the first half of the month did not have a clear trajectory. Entering the first week of the second half of the month, the lowest US dollar price stopped at 5.25, and the second week's opening, closing, high, and low records all rose uniformly. As for the British pound, the lowest price generally stopped at 3.484375 and above.</p>
<p>The expectation of exchange rates hovering and easing was originally based on the hope of an improvement in the international situation favorable to China's war of resistance. Sure enough, on September 26th, the United States formally announced the continuation of a $25 million loan to China, followed by the Axis powers declaring the establishment of a military and economic alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan, and Japan's empty threats to the United States. The United States responded with various measures of preparedness for war, and Britain decided to reopen the Burma Road. The situation in the Pacific Ocean changed drastically, and foreign exchange bulls sold endlessly. The US dollar suddenly rose to 5.625 at the end of September, rose again to 5.78125 on October 7th, and broke through the 6 yuan mark on the 9th, reaching a high price of 6.0625; the British pound also reached a high price of 3.875 on October 9th. Speculators who bought October-term exchange at market prices of around £3.5 and $5.3 in September, since the end of September, realizing the unfavorable situation, have been cutting their losses to avoid further losses due to any more unfavorable developments in the Pacific situation for the bulls. However, the foreign exchange market situation has hovered and contracted again this weekend. What will the future trend be?</p>
<p>Let's start with the international situation. The reason why the exchange market has tightened somewhat in the past two days is that there has been no new development in the Pacific situation. After the United States responded to Japan's empty threats with strong actions, the "no hesitation to fight" attitude turned into a moderate tone. Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke asserted that the Tripartite Pact was aimed at the United States, hoping that the United States and other countries in a neutral position would not be drawn into the vortex of the European war, and would not clash with Japan because of the China issue or other reasons. Speculators therefore believe that although the situation in the Pacific Ocean is on the verge of explosion, Japan does not have the courage to launch an attack on the United States. Secondly, from Japan's economic perspective, it is well known that Japan lacks foreign exchange. The resources for the current war completely rely on the ability to export trade with Britain and the United States. If Japan disregards everything and starts a war with Britain and the United States, the silk goods sold to the United States and the cotton goods sold to Britain will inevitably lose their original markets. The cotton industry, the economic lifeline of Japan, would find it difficult to obtain the supply of raw cotton from the United States and Egypt, and it would be even more difficult to obtain copper from Canada, minerals from the United States, and iron and jute from India, as well as nickel, aluminum, tungsten, etc. from Britain. At present, the various economic embargoes imposed by the United States on Japan have already caused Japan great inconvenience. Once Japan goes to war with Britain and the United States, a comprehensive economic war by Britain and the United States against Japan will cause Japan's export trade to come to a complete halt. Military resources would be impossible to obtain. Without waiting for a military victory, Japan would be placed in a situation of certain defeat economically. Therefore, Japan would never dare to go to war with the United States and Britain. With the elimination of the negative factors, the market turned tighter.</p>
<p>If the above is true, the exchange market may hover around the current level or even contract slightly in the near future. However, the situation in the Pacific Ocean will certainly not continue as Suma, a spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, claimed, "The overall situation here is very calm." The Axis powers of Germany and Italy are letting Japan maintain its vested interests in Vietnam. The Axis powers' whip of challenge is whipping the Japanese military tightly. The opening of the滇緬 Burma Road, and the active aid to China by the United States and Britain, are huge conflicts and blows to Japan's determination to build a "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." The situation changes rapidly. There are many negative factors and few positive factors. This can be determined. Let's further speculate based on the situation as follows: (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Raw White Slightly Up</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the lower grade "car white" continued to ease. The association's price was 14.75 yuan per picul for spot raw white from local warehouses, up 0.20 yuan; 74.80 yuan per picul from foreign warehouses, up 0.40 yuan. Re-export spot remained at 59 yuan. Dutch Red spot was 56.30 yuan. Taikoo "car white" B mark from western warehouses was 72.50 yuan, up 0.20 yuan; DY mark 70.40 yuan, up a small 0.80 yuan; HX mark 69.80 yuan, down a small 1 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cooked Coal Soars</h3>
<p>Recently, it has been heard that the output of cooked coal from 自來火行 "self-ignition" suppliers is low, and the cost of sources from various places is high due to high external expenses, making it uneconomical. As a result, spot goods are decreasing daily, and prices are soaring. Among industry peers, cooked coal chunks are 190 yuan per ton, and unified coal is 185 yuan. Local street shops generally sell it for 10 yuan per picul, it is said.</p>
<h3>Dried Longan at Unprecedented High Price</h3>
<p>Due to the long interruption of shipments and lack of stock in the market, dried longan from Fuqing, with dozens of varieties, which arrived a few days ago, are regarded as rare commodities. It was heard yesterday that the price had already been opened, four to five times higher than before, creating an unprecedented high price. Xing Si Yuan's sales have even been raised to 760 yuan. However, it is heard that there are efforts to transport goods from 石碼 Shima and Quanzhou, etc., and the market will inevitably ease later.</p>
<h3>Walnuts Also Trending Upward</h3>
<p>This year's new walnut harvest is still abundant, but due to the difficulty of sourcing and the small amount of goods arriving, the price has been rising again and again. Yesterday, 200 bags of ordinary Qingzhou peaches were opened, priced at 94 yuan, which is the same as the opening price of the first batch of hand-picked peaches. It is also a new high price.</p>
<h3>Black Iron Billets Firm and Steady</h3>
<p>The market for black iron billets has recently been quite lively due to the enthusiastic bidding from local hot water bottle factories, etc. However, customers from other places are unable to purchase in large quantities due to shipping schedules and transportation difficulties, so they are unable to raise prices. Currently, good quality goods are sold at 1,300 yuan per 2,000 pounds, while the second-best quality is sold at 1,000 yuan plus an odd bundle.</p>
<h3>Thin Galvanized Iron Sheets Attractive</h3>
<p>Due to the wide range of users and the lack of raw materials, thin galvanized iron sheets are not produced much by the factories, and the stock in the hands of traders is also limited. For a time, the trend was exceptionally hot, and the asking price soared. Currently, 3' x 7' sheets are sold at 8.50 yuan each, and 3' x 6' sheets also require 7.50 yuan, it is said.</p>

<h3>China's Wartime Finance (Continued 2)</h3>
<p>— Yu Xie Lin</p>
<p>(3) Improvement of the Wartime Tax System</p>
<p>According to the financial precedents of various countries, increasing taxes is originally the mainstay of wartime finance. During the Fifth European War, the United States advocated the "half tax, half bond" theory; after the outbreak of the current European War, Britain's wartime emergency budget reached 193.3 million pounds, but 99.7 million pounds of which were new tax revenues. Moreover, from the experience of the previous European War, the higher the proportion of tax revenues in wartime finance, the easier it is to reorganize finances after the war, and the budget can be quickly restored to balance after the war. Therefore, wartime tax policies are valued. However, the success of increasing taxes depends on the country's tax system, the people's ability to pay taxes, and the wartime environment. The reason why Britain's wartime tax revenues can reach a satisfactory level is that its peacetime finances have already been based on direct taxes. But this is not the case in our country. Peacetime finances are mainly based on customs, salt, and consolidated taxes. After the successive fall of the coastal provinces, revenues have been drastically reduced. However, in order to make up for this shortfall, and to consider the fairness of the people's burden, we are quite proactive in reforming the tax system. Reforming the tax system can increase wartime tax revenues and lay a good foundation for post-war finances. The wartime tax policy will be discussed in three aspects:</p>
<p>(1) Direct taxes are called good taxes because they meet the three principles of fairness, universality, and elasticity. In the peacetime finances of the United States and the United States, direct taxes are also the mainstay, and they are even more important during and after the war. The financial authorities of our country, in view of this, are working hard to build a direct tax system, so that the future tax revenue center can be placed on direct taxes. Direct taxes are based on income tax, inheritance tax, excessive profits tax in extraordinary times, and stamp tax as the mainstay. Although income tax has not been established for a long time, and the methods of taxation are not yet perfect, and at the current time when the war zone is expanding, the tax revenue has doubled compared to before the war. Inheritance tax has also been officially levied from July 1 this year. As for the excessive profits tax in extraordinary times, it has also been widely promoted, and the results are very good. The stamp tax was also increased from October 11, 1937, increasing the tax rate and expanding the scope of pasting. In terms of the current state of national tax revenues, direct tax revenues have risen from the sixth place before the war to the third place. If the direct tax system can be improved, the increase in future tax revenues will be unlimited, and it will make a great contribution to the reorganization of post-war finances.</p>
<p>(3) Our country's indirect tax system is very unreasonable. The tax rates on luxury goods seem to be still low, and the tax rates on daily necessities are already too high, making the people's burden even more unfair. In order to make up for the revenue shortfall of customs, salt, and consolidated taxes, the government authorities have actively reorganized the indirect tax system to gradually make the tax system more reasonable and the people's burden fairer. And without hindering the people's lives and the national economy, the tax rate will be moderately increased to enrich the national treasury. For example: (1) reorganizing the salt tax; (2) expanding the local goods entrepot tax from October 1, 1937; (3) the consolidated tax is changed to be verified and supplemented by the first-level competent consolidated tax authority upon entry, and promoted to various provinces in the inland; (4) from October 13, 1937, the additional levy of local wine and the implementation of local tobacco tax; (5) modifying the customs tariff rates, reducing the tax rates on imports of necessities, changing the current tax rates to one-third; as for the export of local goods, from June 1, 1938, the current export selection of handicrafts, fishery products, and agricultural products 34 are exempted from export tax to facilitate foreign sales. From the above, the government has both increases and decreases in tax rates. The increased ones are all luxury goods, which can both increase tax revenues and encourage frugality.</p>
<p>(3) In order to show consideration for the people's hardships and protect the people's strength, the financial authorities of our country give appropriate exemptions or rent reductions to those affected by the war in the war zone and near the war zone, in order to lighten the people's burden, so that the areas affected by the war can gradually recover their vitality and cultivate future tax sources.</p>
<p>In short, the purpose of the reorganization of our country's wartime tax system is not only to seek an increase in current income, but to establish a sound tax system, open up reasonable tax sources, make people equally responsible for their ancestors and citizens, and make tax revenues elastic, in order to establish a strong foundation for post-war finance.</p>
<h3>Soviet-German Trade System</h3>
<p>— Wu Yugan Answers</p>
<p>(1) What are the differences between the international trade methods of Germany and the United States and Britain?</p>
<p>Germany's foreign trade is now being conducted under the government's vigorous control. The difference between this and the international trade of Britain and the United States is: in essence, only the degree of control is different; in terms of methods, only the scope of control is different. Originally, since the completion of Germany's new economic control plan in 1936, the control of foreign trade was stricter than that of Britain, the United States and other countries. Britain, the United States and other countries often used tariff policies and other items as tools to control trade, while Germany now focuses on the control of imported foreign exchange. Although the operation of imports can be freely conducted by the people, the remittance of import prices must obtain the approval of the control authority in advance, otherwise it is not allowed to be划付劃付划付劃付 paid. The government's reason for controlling imported foreign exchange in this way is naturally the same as the import and export commodity exchange system that was vigorously carried out in the past few years. It is also to restrict unnecessary imports in order to seek a balance in foreign trade income and expenditure. Therefore, Germany believes that this method of control is slightly better than the free trade system of Britain and the United States. As for export trade, Germany has also been controlling export foreign exchange recently. Exporters can certainly transport and sell goods abroad as much as possible, but the foreign exchange obtained must be sold to the government at the exchange rate stipulated by the government. These are all places where Germany's control of foreign trade is stricter than that of Britain and the United States.</p>

<h3>The Knitting Industry in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Si Hua</p>
<p>The History of Knitting</p>
<p>Wool yarn was introduced to China more than 50 years ago. At that time, it was not used much, only for tying hair. Later, Westerners introduced knitting technology to the public to help sell wool yarn, which proved to be very effective. However, the knitting method was ordinary, without any patterns or styles, and there were no specialized knitting talents. The first items hand-knitted with wool yarn were only hats, gloves, shoes, and scarves. The knitting of lined wool vests came later. Because they were light and warm, much better than cotton vests, they were once very popular. In 1933, the Tianjin Ram Brand Wool Yarn Factory held an exhibition in Shanghai, at the China National Products Company, Sincere Company, and Lihua Company, and invited Ms. Liao Fenghua and others to preside over the teaching of wool yarn knitting methods. The public unveiling of the new knitting method started from this.</p>
<p>Knitting Figures</p>
<p>The first to be mentioned should be Ms. Huang Peiying. After graduating from Minli Girls' High School, Ms. Huang went to Japan to study wool yarn knitting. She returned to China in 1928 and invented the table needle machine. In 1929, she was approved by the National Government and obtained a patent. She founded the Peiyang Training Institute and wrote the Peiying Knitting Method. Her works won a special prize at the Puyi Crafts Institute National Products Exhibition. In 1933, she was hired by the Ram Brand Wool Yarn Department of Lihua Company as a knitting professor. Her theoretical and technical skills were both perfect and she can be called a pioneer in the knitting industry. Ms. Bao Guofang is also famous as Ms. Huang. She researched wool yarn knitting very early. In 1933, she was a knitting professor in the Ram Brand Wool Yarn Department of the China National Products Company in Shanghai. In the same year, she went to the China National Products Company in Suzhou to preside over the same position, and again to the China National Products Company in Songjiang to preside over the same position. Later, she broadcasted and taught knitting methods on the China Radio Station. Ms. Bao was the first to teach knitting methods in the air. She wrote a knitting book, which is still selling very well today. The third is Ms. Feng Qiuping. She graduated from Qiude Girls' High School. She was very interested in wool yarn knitting when she was in school. She studied and invented many novel patterns after school. Many classmates often asked her for advice. She has already become a knitting teacher. After leaving school, she has served as a knitting professor in Dasin, Xinxin, Fuan and other companies, and founded the Liangyou Knitting Society. She has many students. There is also Ms. Ni Xiuyue, who currently works at the flagship store of Hengyuanxiang, a wool yarn giant on Xingsheng Street. She earnestly teaches customers the latest knitting methods, and is hired by the Shanghai Wool Yarn Factory to broadcast and teach at the Xinhua Radio Station every morning at 10 o'clock. Ms. Ni is proficient in knitting and has a kind attitude. She is truly a rising star in the knitting industry.</p>
<p>Prospects for Knitting</p>
<p>Knitting cannot be regarded as just one type of needlework. It is actually a new path for many women to engage in production. Considering the current popularity of wool yarn clothing in Shanghai, it will surely spread throughout the country in the future. Although many rural women are familiar with knitting skills, they stick to the old ways and do not know how to improve. They urgently need to be guided. The author hopes that knitting magazines will be printed in the future, knitting vocational schools will be established, and even knitting shops will be like the Su Guang clothing stores, which can be seen everywhere on the streets and alleys.</p>
<p>The Hidden Pain of Weavers</p>
<p>Since the shrinkage of foreign exchange, overseas countries have imported large quantities of wool yarn, using China's extremely low wages to recruit workers to knit, and then transport them to Europe and the United States. The British-owned Hutchison &amp; Co. and Xinji &amp; Co. are engaged in this type of export business. Currently, gloves are the main product. They issue wages of just over 4 jiao per pair, which is reduced by layers of exploitation through large and small contractors. The actual amount workers receive is only just over 2 jiao, while the contractors enrich themselves, with some accumulating assets of hundreds of thousands. I hope that export firms will consider the difficult lives of female workers and seek a remedy, or directly pay the workers, which is what the workers eagerly hope for.</p>

<h3>Umbrella Pine Pattern Knitting</h3>

<p>The umbrella pine pattern is very suitable for knitting children's clothing, women's new clothes, and waistcoat, etc. The knitting method is simple, and the pattern is clear and elegant. However, when we learn, we must pay special attention to one point, which is the three methods of decreasing stitches. The methods are as follows:</p>
<p>First method... That is, knit two stitches together.</p>
<p>Second method... First pick out one stitch, knit the next stitch, and cast off the picked out stitch.</p>
<p>Third method... This method is used for knitting two stitches together. First pick out one stitch, knit two stitches together, and cast off the picked out stitch.</p>

<h3>The National and Public Welfare of Knitting Wool Yarn</h3>
<p>— Yao Huifang</p>
<p>At this time of emergency, everything is expensive. People living on isolated islands, regardless of upper, middle, or lower classes, the three items that are necessary for daily life and cannot be separated from are clothing, food, and housing, with clothing being the first. Originally for hygiene and to express one's appearance, from spring to winter, the four seasons alternate, costing a lot of money; the wealthy certainly have no problem, but ordinary classes or families with large populations have a significant expense, especially in the current situation, it feels even more difficult. But to solve this problem, to seek a cheap, high-quality, and durable solution, I felt that the modern popular wool yarn knitting of various costumes can be called a win-win situation, extremely convenient. Wool yarn raw materials are originally made of wool, which is extremely warm and can replace fur. Fur clothing is difficult to modify and expensive, while wool yarn can be disassembled at any time if it is not suitable. After washing, even after three or five years, it is still as good as new. Being able to learn knitting can also save the high cost of tailoring. Small items such as children's clothing, gloves, shoes, socks, scarves, hats, coats, overcoats, etc., can be made as thick or thin as you like, with endless variations. As the art of knitting has not yet become widespread, I want to compete with Europe and the United States to develop the knitting industry in China, so that women have more production skills. Therefore, I am broadcasting oral instructions daily on various radio stations in Shanghai, and have printed a wool yarn knitting manual for guidance. (Sold at Guofang Knitting Society, No. 51, New Market, Jing'an Temple Road, Mullin Road. Those who are interested in knitting can contact or discuss it there and will be welcome.)</p>

<h3>Sending Off the "Daylight Saving Time Movement"</h3>
<p>— Yang Zhicheng</p>
<p>The "Daylight Saving Time Movement" ended on the 12th of this month. The original intention of this movement was to eradicate the bad habit of wasting time among the general public, so as to save material and human resources. Its profound intention is obvious. However, the formation of this habit cannot be simply and broadly attributed to what some people say: "The Chinese are inherently lazy and do not save time." Just look at the vast countryside of China, where people have been inheriting the habit of "working at sunrise and resting at sunset" for thousands of years without slacking off. Even in Shanghai, most people (workers, students, etc.) still grasp their time very regularly and do not waste it. But we cannot deny that there are many people in Shanghai who treat night as day and day as night. This is of course not just a matter of "habit," but rather the result of Shanghai's society. It has produced all kinds of people, and even a group of people who spend their days indulging in pleasure. Thus, gambling dens, dance halls, theaters... this is the inevitable malformation of a capitalist society! The result of the Daylight Saving Time Movement may have changed their living time a little, but the crux of the problem lies in their "lives." The conservation of time and the rectification of life are two inseparable links. A person whose life is full and intense will never waste his time. Conversely, what improvement does the saving of time bring to the life of a lazy and dissolute person? Therefore, when the Daylight Saving Time Movement comes to an end, we hope that everyone will deeply examine their own lives and use every minute of their time for undertakings that are beneficial to improvement. If everyone can save and manage their time, then there is no need to shout loudly about any "Daylight Saving Time Movement."</p>
<h3>Exploiting Trainee Employees for Speculation</h3>
<p>— Bai Shunian</p>
<p>The Malicious Policies of a Certain Business</p>
<p>Shanghai's fall into the "isolated island" status has led to the abnormal development of various industries, especially the flourishing of speculative businesses, which is beyond expectation. Beyond the scope of securities, foreign exchange, cotton cloth, food, and daily necessities, there are even speculative capitalists who use the name of recruiting trainee employees to entice unemployed and out-of-school youth. Their brutal and cruel methods are escalating, which is another serious problem in society.</p>
<p>My family originally lived in a remote rural area. Only I was working outside to make a living. After the "August 13th" Incident, the countryside was affected, so we took refuge in Shanghai. My several family members relied on my meager salary to survive, which was very difficult. At that time, my younger brother had just graduated from elementary school. Because we could not afford to continue his education, he responded to a recruitment advertisement for trainee employees from a certain business and went to take the exam. He was actually accepted. I then contacted the business to complete all the procedures. The manager received me and personally gave me the regulations. These included a three-year training period, with the business providing a monthly allowance for pocket money. Within the time limit, if the trainee was expelled by the business for violating regulations, or if he resigned on his own, then all the costs incurred by the business for the trainee's food and lodging during the employment period had to be compensated by the trainee, and a reliable guarantor had to be provided. The details of the trainee's work situation were not explicitly stated. At the time, although I felt that the conditions were too harsh, I had no choice but to accept them silently due to the pressure of making a living. Before my younger brother had been with the business for a month, he complained to me about the hard work and harsh treatment. At the time, I thought it was a common problem for young people to be unable to endure hardship, so I encouraged him to work hard and not give up in the face of difficulties. Now, almost three years have passed. My younger brother returned home the other day and solemnly declared to me: a crisis is imminent. When I asked him the reason, he said that the business manager had, a few days ago, dismissed several other trainee employees on some pretext, and had demanded back compensation fees amounting to more than a thousand yuan. Like rabbits mourning the death of foxes, sympathizing with their own kind, all the colleagues were trembling with fear; because who is without fault, if one is slightly careless, there is always a pretext to be dismissed; the individual not only loses his job, but also has to bear the compensation costs, and their reputation is also affected, causing deep anxiety about the future. I am in an extremely difficult situation, and I can only urge my younger brother to be extra careful.</p>
<p>I secretly think that other people's children abandon their studies to go into business, originally hoping to learn skills for making a living so that they can establish themselves in society. Who would have thought that heartless and sick people would take advantage of this period of severe unemployment. Moreover, the trainee's work is heavy, perhaps twice as much as that of an ordinary employee, but they are not paid a salary. Now they are using this kind of method, which is worse than fraud, on a group of poor, out-of-school youth. How can this not make people gnash their teeth! There is no shortage of people who uphold justice in society, so I have specifically detailed the beginning and end of the matter as an appeal. (Refuses remuneration)</p>
<p>Hawthorne Detective Case</p>
<h3>The Ending of the Dance Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Nine: Astonishing News</p>
<p>I nodded and said, "Yes. So, you think this A print was left by Old Mao?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne suddenly stood up, shaking his head as he muttered to himself, "I don't know. I really can't explain it." He put his hands behind his back and began to pace back and forth in the office with his head lowered, showing that he had fallen into deep thought again.</p>
<p>The room was silent for a while, and Hawthorne still didn't say anything. I couldn't bear it any longer and asked,</p>
<p>"Hawthorne, what are you thinking about? According to you, since Lu Jiansheng has been ruled out as a possible perpetrator, and if Yu Gantang's confession is completely credible, he doesn't seem to be the main culprit in the case either. Then, out of the three suspects, only Zhao Boxiong remains. Now, based on Yu Gantang's confirmation—which naturally requires us to completely believe his words as a prerequisite—Zhao Boxiong's suspicion should be further deepened. We only need to force him to confess the truth, and naturally everything will be revealed. Why are you so hesitant? Hawthorne, what exactly are you thinking? Why don't you tell me?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne's pace still didn't stop, and he answered distractedly, "I'm thinking about Zhao Boxiong's sneer, and I'm also thinking—"</p>
<p>A burst of rapid telephone ringing interrupted his words. Hawthorne suddenly stopped, hesitated slightly, and hurried to the telephone. I also followed him, as if I had a kind of instinctive intuition that this time the phone call would bring some startling news. After Hawthorne picked up the receiver, I knew that the other party was Ni Jinshou. Ni Jinshou's voice was particularly loud, and I could hear every word clearly as I stood next to him. The news was indeed startling.</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou said, "Mr. Hawthorne, things have gone sour—completely sour! Zhao Boxiong has left!"</p>
<p>Hawthorne's hand holding the receiver also trembled, and he asked with wide eyes, "Left? But did he escape?"</p>
<p>"No, Director Cui let him go. I had dinner at home and rushed to the bureau, preparing to question Zhao Boxiong. It is said that he first wrote a note to the director, and then asked to make a phone call. After a while, the director called him in for a meeting, talked for a while, and let him go on the spot. Don't you think this is embarrassing?"</p>
<p>"Strange!" Hawthorne couldn't say anything else besides these two words. He was stunned. I also thought that this news was too unexpected. For a moment, not only could I not think of a response, but I also couldn't figure out what reason Director Cui had for abusing his power and letting go of such an important suspect so easily. Unexpectedly, even more startling news continued to come from the phone. (135)</p>
<h3>Starting from "Overcrowded Prisons"</h3>
<p>— Shi Wei</p>
<p>The newspapers on the 10th of this month carried a piece of news worth paying attention to, that is, the Jiangsu-Shanghai Second Special District Prison on Route Massenet in the French Concession. Because the prison cells are not large, the capacity of prisoners is stipulated not to exceed 1,600 people; "However, since the "August 13th" Shanghai Battle occurred, and the cost of living has risen day by day, the number of criminals has also increased day by day." It is said that at most, there were more than 2,500 people. Because the authorities had economic difficulties, they had allowed bail for those sentenced to less than five years of imprisonment and non-recidivists in February of this year. By the 9th of this month, four such rounds had been held.</p>
<p>To become a criminal because the cost of living is "high" can be said to be "the norm since ancient times, and even more so today." The fact is very clear: if a person is not born into the world, then so be it. Once born, a person always wants to live on; and when drinking cement and eating cold rice cannot sustain breathing, then one must embrace the "principle of survival" of "rather commit a crime than starve to death" and take a risk. If one is lucky enough to escape the law, then one can still survive for a few days; even if one is unfortunately caught, one can still "sit and eat prison food."</p>
<p>Writing this, I am reminded of a story: a few years ago, right here in Shanghai, a young man who had been unemployed for a long time went to throw himself into the Huangpu River because he had no means of living; as a result, he was rescued by the Life Saving Society. The person in charge of the Life Saving Society said to him, "You are young, you must think positively about everything." But the young man replied, "I have no food to eat, can you save me?" The person in charge said that this was not within their jurisdiction, so the next day, a corpse floated up on the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>Now, among these hundreds of criminals who have been released on bail, whether some will "return to the forbidden land" remains to be proven by facts; but considering the prevalence of robbery and fraud, there are certainly many "followers." Therefore, stabilizing the lives of citizens and punishing those who disturb the lives of citizens—especially the "rice weevils"—should be an urgent task that cannot be delayed.</p>
<h3>The Rise and Fall of Rice Prices</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Rice prices rose, from 15 yuan to 20 yuan.</p>
<p>Rice prices fell, from 20 yuan to 19 yuan.</p>
<p>Rice prices rose, from 19 yuan to 30 yuan.</p>
<p>Rice prices fell, from 30 yuan to 29 yuan.</p>
<p>Rice prices rose, from 70 yuan to 99 yuan.</p>
<p>Rice prices fell, from 99 yuan to 95 yuan.</p>
<p>Rice prices fell!</p>
<p>Rice prices fell!</p>
<p>Rice prices fell!!!</p>
