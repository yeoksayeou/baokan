<h3 id="c12">豫鄂戰役論 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>去年蔣委員長雙十節告國人書中，曾指出『吾人今日在軍事方面實已建立基礎，必能爭取勝利，凡我前綫將士，必能日益充實革命基礎，發揮車事力量，竭盡軍人衛國保種之天職，以慰我同胞之期望。』這種昭示，一再經事實證明；及至最近，華軍在豫南鄂北又獲空前大捷，更見制勝基礎的確鑿與雄厚。</p>
<p>日本現階段的對華政策，雖以奸偽爲媒介，似乎偏重於政治進攻與經濟進攻，但以軍事完成其侵略的夢想，還是始終不放棄的。他在最初，滿以爲武漢攻下後，就可以解決中國問題，而兩年來的事實證明，一切都不如日本所想像。日本雖佔領了中國一部份主要的交通綫，可是交通綫的兩側，依然在華軍控制之下，隨時用了機動的戰略，切斷父通綫，威脅他在交通綫上的重要據點。日本如果不能用所謂掃蕩戰來解除自身所受的威脅，隨時有被中國寸寸切斷，處處打擊的可能。但日本一年來掃蕩戰的結果是什麼？中條太行的八决進攻，遭了八决的慘敗；滿望肅淸山西的華軍，却每决找到了自已的墳墓；滿想渡河南下，指望着肅淸豫北華軍，西犯潼洛而進窺關中的夢想，不但終成泡影；且蹈了去年的覆轍，又遭了迎頭痛擊，大敗而回。最近費了三個月的時間，調了十五萬軍隊，選了襄樊爲目標，大舉作第三次的進攻；他以爲控制了襄樊，不但可以解除武漢的威脅，並且也可作爲窺潼洛四川的重要根據地；不料與以前兩次的同樣目標之下，同樣戰略之下，而較前兩次失敗更速，傷亡更重。由他的三攻襄樊而三大敗，至少證明了他的敗決非偶然，中國的勝決非僥倖，却有其必然條件：第一，日本對華慣用的戰略，即是迂迴包抄戰，那就是兩翼迅速的行動，予中國軍隊以打擊，而中間用錐形的突貫，以擊破華軍的主力：這一策略，不但早爲中國將領所識破，且彼的兵力不夠適應這種戰略的需要，士氣衰頹，不經苦戰；而華軍復加强兩翼的實力，中央堅守，日本就無法獲得它預期的效果。去年日軍進犯鄂北，分兩路前進，一路佯攻沙洋，一路直逼隨縣洋梓；其後，日軍先在新野唐河遇到華軍嚴重的打擊，同時隨縣棗陽的華軍，在日軍後方破壞交通，日軍遂一潰而不可收拾。這决日軍的進攻，它依然用那種迂迴包抄的戰略；由信陽犯桐柏，由長台關犯泌陽，由隨棗犯唐河，由鍾祥犯長壽店，數路進展，都以殲滅華軍，佔領襄樊爲其最後目標。而華軍不但未受包圍，目以更美妙的戰略，由多方面的機動戰，奏了大功。第二，鄂北豫南這一地帶，一方面是漢水以東長江以北古雲夢澤一部分的沼澤地帶，一方面也是大洪山桐柏山的山陵地帶；原來日本陸軍的長處，就是機械化部隊比華軍較優，這在平原纔是他最理想的戰塲；今乃不自量力而進窺山陵沼澤地帶、，使他自已的部隊先犯半身不遂的重症，宜其慘敗。第三，日本旣不放棄侵略，而想以和平來欺騙中國軍民；此其結果，並非中國方面的當然不會上當，却是日本方面的當然兵無鬥志，又安得不敗。這三條件，是日本方面慘敗的主因，何况中國方面更有制勝的因素呢！</p>
<p>華軍這决空前的勝利，不獨予國際及國內人士對中國抗戰的力量，有更正確的認識，更堅定的信心，同時也該使日本軍閥對於軍事完成侵略的迷夢，及早幻滅吧。中國勝利之基礎，誠如蔣委員長所謂業已建立，而全國軍民當今日的急務，還在發揮威力，直逼最後勝利的關頭。</p>

<p>「無論誰做皇帝、做百姓祇有納糧、」這是汕頭失陷前最流行的漢奸理論、有人還痴想着「外兵到來更好、洋米免稅、大家有平米食、政府小許洋米免稅進口、反設立公司屯糧、那是官奪民食、如此政府、要他來何用、」這些思想、這般理論、殊令人痛心、現在鐵一般的事實給你看、你們希望吃平米、速米袋包亦不給你看見、你想食餅、他給你一條蛇、你想保持私人商業家產、不遵命疏散搬走、留在淪陷區的東西、、除了淸風明月空氣海水之外、完全沒有給你自由享受、自己佔有的可能、休說一切沒有你份、連自己的身體、妻子骨肉、都已非你自己所有、礦山·沙川·土地·房屋·工廠·學校·年靑的姑娘、十二歲以下的孩子、沒有一件不給「和平提携」的人搶去了、有何話說的、有何官司可打呢、</p>
<p>然而我們絕對不悲觀、光明之子、終投到光明的營壘中、蛇的後裔、沒有死去之前、已經投入活地獄裏、試想、豺狼羣裏、豈能應許羔羊的存在麼、蒺藜的園中、生長小出美好的百合花、看吧、社會大變的剎那間、遺留着很多可歌可泣的事跋、給大家看、一看便會淸醒過來、</p>
<p>（一）汕頭市的鐵路·公路汽車·內河汽船·自來水廠·電燈局·大的旅館·洋房·一切的一切·都給福大公司·××會社、無條件佔了去、以後、有人高呼經濟提携合作、你們試想、私人所有的、已經完了、誰肯再拿錢出去、創辦實業、繁榮市面呢、以後惟有給日人們自己一手去創造、去繁榮、他們沒有錢、祇能印刷軍用票、軍用票在外國買不到物資、常然沒有人存積常資財、那些軍用票、連日台人亦不信用、時時掉換中國法幣收存、所以、汕頭市失了將近一年、沒有一間新建房子、沒有新購的物品、市面上除了洋行之外、看不到商店進貨、洋行開張、等於物資的兌換店、日人將軍用票在市面散出、人民得了、依舊向洋行買物、等於一種兌現、他們獨佔潮汕市塲、其意義非常簡單、不過如此而已、民族資本、華僑匯款、仍不斷的向內地流入、</p>
<p>（二）汕頭至平路臣盛公司、是潮安人蔡石珊開的、代理香港洋行經售電燈機器·發電機·汽車等、每年獲利不少、去年、華軍華振中旅長、下令谷工廠商店將貨物搬走、臣盛公司獨違令不搬、當時有謠言、說需要運動費、可以緩搬、如某火柴工廠、被迫遷移、出了若干銀子、乃延緩一月、潮汕鐵路被迫拆軌、該路負責人張福英到韶關運動之後、可以拆到菴埠爲止、疏散物資的作用、不過有人想發國難財、搬遷之時、僱船僱工、如何困難、政府人員途中檢查、如何留難、造謠中傷政府的人、畫蛇添足、可謂遺憾之至、好了、天地轉變了、不能受痛苦煎熬的人、終歸淘汰出去、發國難財的人、離脫了抗戰陣營、擺在眼前的事實、當時破壞不澈底的鐵路·電燈·自來水公司、現在便落在日人的荷包中、而且臣盛洋行·致和祥五金店等均被封了、他們妄想以爲戰事一起、貨物小能進口、所存的貨品、可以高價出售、並反譏笑公昌公司、千辛萬苦、把機器運上梅縣去、出了巨額運費、當古董一般藏起、眞不値得、公昌負責人章公劍說、我的機器運往梅縣、縱令不能售出、寗可白白送給政府用、然而、臣盛公司的蔡石珊、却自己打私人算盤、沒有遠見、給日人査封了、還想發財、眞笑話極了、二十輛汽車沒有裝好、連同十五副發電機、蔡對日人說、這是洋行寄售的物件、日人答、你可照價開單罷、通通要買受、一槪搬走了、臣盛果然開單去到日特務機關領錢、一次·二次·以至十餘次、得一個答復說、你的政府欠下我政府的錢，將來賠款淸算之時、這款必有着落、我簽字給你罷、算是點收了若干、以後不必再來了、致和祥五金店的銅鐵器具、被封多天、花錢數千元、託人揭封、目的達到之後、貨物是禁品、全給人搬走代管了、還有一家、是昇平街的蟻興記培基茶店、往年以台灣茶冒充福建茶每年獲利十萬元以上、歷次發生愛國運動、他都有法子做生意、茶葉運入台人貨倉、改裝之後、當作閩茶、運銷南洋各埠、自己以後結交了好朋友、這回日兵到來、他以爲是他們的世界了、不料招牌·店位·貨架·存茶·全副傢伙、給一個日人租去了、寫回一張借單、把蟻興記夥伴東家趕走、天天照常營業、茶由台灣運來汕頭、以上不過略舉數端、還有很多大公司、已經不動聲色、易了主人了、</p>

<p>據外人方面消息、滬郊游擊隊領袖葉琛及顧復生、最近議決某種策略、務期於聯合之步伐下、予日人以嚴重打擊、葉琛所部戰士，不下五萬人、在上星期中、曾自北部挺進至吳淞區內、以策應軍事當局對日軍之攻勢、</p>
<p>葉部開到士氣大振</p>
<p>據華方之消息、在上月中，葉琛與顧復生曾數度會晤、就戰略上及各方面、會商合作辦法、目前聞已有若干結果、葉琛之部隊開抵滬郊後、已使滬郊游擊隊員精神爲之大振、且實力亦爲之增强、</p>
<p>大量軍火運滬接濟</p>
<p>又據傳葉琛在前數月、曾在揚子江某區內、加緊其部下之訓練、目備有輕兵器及來福槍等、爲數可觀、且傳葉之部隊曾由某處運來大量軍火、接濟滬郊原有之游擊隊、至於葉顧所預定之戰略、即將江蘇省區內劃分爲兩大游羣區、一爲沿京滬路至其北部、一爲沿滬杭路綫之區域、</p>
<p>一度交綏日偽受創</p>

<p>昨天是Whitmondav降臨節之後一日，離開復活節（俗稱外國淸明），已有七個星期了。在這所謂Whitsuntide—「降臨節之週」的開始中，上海的初夏量象，也就在吾們眼前活躍起來。</p>
<p>本來，吃通了珊紅的櫻桃，雲白的酒釀，大家無疑地已走進了夏日之門。從隆冬的厚重衣服中解放出來，每個人的身上，色彩愈弄愈明顯，質料越看越單薄；肚裏裝的東西，也從濃膩的厚味，漸進於輕鬆流利之途。假使這夏之門是實體的，那末，一定很窄很狹，和財主們所必經的天堂門一樣呢。</p>
<p>「可口可樂」……冰洪淋……橘汁……汽水……這偉大的冷飮包圍圈，不知不覺地已把整個的上海做了它們的包圍對象。從現在開始，這包圍圈如何發揮它的威力，只不過時間與空間之爭而已。</p>
<p>上海最著名一家糖果餅乾公司的紀念冊中，裏面有這樣的一段：「開胃的早餐，晨間的咖啡，工作忙碌人們的中膳，朋友間的茶話，娛樂以後的冷飮，幽靜的晚餐，以及全日飲冰室的服務……」冷飲在上海某一階級中的地位，不是很明顯的吿訴我們了麽？</p>
<p>出售冷飮的所在，在上海普通稱之爲飮冰室，其實是脫胎於美國的S　oda　Ffountain—蘇打泉。發明這買賣的祖師是一個逃亡於美國的法國人，名叫杜朗—E.Durand。他於一八二五年四月間，開始在費拉台爾菲亞開飮冰室。那時離開現在一百十五年—淸道光五年，還在梁啟超誕生之前哩！</p>
<p>我們跑進一家上等的冷飮室時，就可以看見所謂「蘇打泉」的特徵。通常是一隻長的櫃台，外面鑲有大理石或磁磚，除了裏面所藏的冰洪淋桶，沙濾水櫃外，靠櫃面一排都是龍頭導管，隨時用手撳，或扳旋那方或圓的箱桶中所儲的發泡飲料。從道一排龍頭中傾瀉出來的液體，發着吱吱嘶嘶的聲昔，同時有一股泡沫浮在杯口，這嘶嘶的聲息，和　花一現的泡沬，便是「正宗」蘇打泉所發生的作用。</p>
<p>考究的蘇打泉櫃台，後面的背景往往是一面晶融光潔的大鏡子，左右桃心木的架子上，放看許多鮮艷奪目的菓汁玻瓶，各種罐頭菓品，和特製的飲料調製器：像「可口可樂」的冷藏箱，紅得像少女的嘴脣，上面兩個C字，靈蛇般的活潑。好立克奶粉的調攪器，高聳鶴立，另有一副秀逸的神情；玻管中一疊高高的消毒紙杯，無異紳士帽子的集團。此外還裝飾着各種色澤協調的廣告畫，玲瓏柔和的反光燈等，一種活動的氣息，打到每一個熱中的顧客心胸裏。（未完）</p>

<p>又訊洋米定貨相繼到埠、今後定訂不劃、乃又引起實力囤買之吸收、兼因五月上期拋貨實碼不足、空頭急於抵補、隨多放價、故五月上期西貢原根結價開六十二元、市上則自六十二元五六角至六十二元八角、已到暹邏二號開六十一元及六十一元半、又小絞六十元零八角至六十一元、比之上週末均大元外、</p>

<p>股票交易、成交大中華火柴公司股一百股、價為二十四元二角半、</p>
<p>衆業股市開盤、人心略現猶豫、賣風較盛、市况似軟、但不久實業股之購者、不復能耐、羣起收買、價格倐被改善、竟晨交易、活潑非凡、直至嚮午、競購者始略歛跡、下午開盤稍有回風、以迄晚收前之一刻鐘、此風轉厲、但售方對於脫手各股、並無急遽之象、</p>

<p>前月底，杭城艮山門外之機神廟，敬神演戲，計有兩晝夜。所演之戲班，聞係由嘉湖雇來，價甚昂貴，班中子弟，共有一百餘人，大半為京班中著名腳色，小旦尤色藝俱佳，行頭亦極鮮艷，襯裏衣袴，皆以五色綢為之，故不惟城外各鄉，遠近奔集，即城中仕女，亦幾傾城往觀，至營中旂人尤成羣結隊而往。但村廟演劇，雖兒童不凖上台，例禁極嚴。是日有數十旂人站立台上觀看，台下之鄉人，高聲呼禁，旂人始則置若罔聞，繼且大聲嚷罵，鄉人等咸為忿忿，齊聲吶喊，勢將作鷹鸇之逐。咖哩　有數十人將戲房門把守，恐其脫逃。乃旂人既以為滿營之可恃，又以為男力之足憑，渺此鄉僻村　，何足當尊拳一飽。其時旂人之在廟觀戲，總計約有七八十人，其輕裘緩帶，儒雅恂恂者，僅有二三十人，餘　好勇鬥狠，輕生任氣之流，見眾鄉人如此佈置，台上之人，必遭網羅，相約一齊動手，為奪門刦人之舉。</p>

<h3 id="c106">母親的品格　（二） <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>母親可分爲數種：有放浪形骸，不盡天職的，有生性不仁，出賣兒女的，還有邪惡如古時耶西下其人的。我們信基督的人，對於這樣的母親，當做點補救的工作。大凡敬愛母親的人，莫不於任何環境之下，盡力保護婦女的。現在社會有種種陷害婦女的事，我們當合力取締，否則，我們提倡「母親日」不免有點滑稽。（二）美麗，白花之形，表明母親的美麗。這句話的意思不是說，凡母親都是美麗的。有的母親不注重外表。這裏所謂美麗，是指母親的生活而言。請看母雞帶領小雞，母牛帶領小牛，多麼有趣，做母親的抱着嬰孩，看上去自然更有意思。世上是最偉大的書，是馬利亞抱聖嬰孩圖，這種美麗，百看不厭。夜深人靜，信主的母親，抱着嬰孩，坐在火爐旁邊，輕唱催眠歌，此情此景，與畫家所繪天使滿臉　歡站在母親周圍的圖畫，初無二致，西諺說，「母親搖搖籃的手，震動天下」，上帝把寶貴的小生命，交托母親手中，要她做聖神工作，使這無疵的童心從小得着良好印象，這種生活，够多麼美麗！（三）愛心，白花之香，表明母親的愛心。花能結果給人食，即把牠摘下撕壞，牠的香氣仍舊長存在，仍就能使人嗅着快樂。母親的愛心，就是這樣。不論她是喜還是憂，是笑是淚，都能使接近的人，得着祝福。上帝所給人的感化力，將給兒女織成一件人格的衣服，要他們永遠穿着。」（待續）如欲詳細研究　函郵箱一二二七號</p>

<h3 id="c107">同情學校 <a href="#c107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— 夏楚</p>
<p>當代英國散文家劉加勘（E.V.Lueas）曾有一篇文章記述他參觀「同情學校」的經過。雖然世界不一定真有這樣一所學校，然而它確能代表一種很新的敎育理想，我們覺得值得介紹給我國讀者。</p>
<p>他說，這所學校的校園校舍都很整潔悅目，可是他一踏進校門，就看見有一個約摸九歲光景的男孩，雙目都給繃帶裹着，另有一個年齡稍大的女孩，謹慎地領了他走路。在會客室裏，他從窗內望出去，看見塲地上有許多快活的小朋友在遊戲，可是他覺得很奇怪，也覺得很難過，　　這許多小朋友並不是個個都像理想中那樣的活潑康健。他看見兩三個孩子，眼睛都像有病似的，有繃帶裹着，看別的孩子領了走路。他又看見一個女孩子，走路撐着枴杖，看樣子她的蹺脚已是沒有希望痊癒的了。</p>
<p>校長當即解釋給他聽道：「她貴在並不真蹺脚，不過今天是她的「跛足日」罷了；同樣的，那些小朋友也不是真瞎子，今天恰巧是他們的「盲目日」罷了。」她接着又說道『這是我們學制的主要點：我們並不灌輸多少思想給兒童，我們要啟發他們的同情心，敎他們能够體帖判給別人的苦難，所以我們先叫他們自己嘗受苦難。在一學期之中，我們每一個兒童都有一個盲目日，一個斷肢日，一個啞口日。在盲目日的那天，他們的眼睛絕對紥緊，不許偷看。繃帶在隔夜裏好，明天早晨醒來，他們就是瞎子了。他們於是樣樣事情都要靠別人幫忙，我們也指導別的兒童，事事去幫助他們，領導他們。這一種辦法對於扮瞎子的和幫助瞎子的兒童，都是很好的敎育。裝瞎子的當然很苦，但許多孩子都說啞口日才是最可怕的，因爲嘴巴上是不紥繃帶的，孩子們必須要運用自已的意志力，才可以不說話……你要到校園裏自己去看看嗎？』</p>
<p>校長領他到一個紥了眼睛的子孩面前，『這裏有一位先生要同你談談，』校長說完就跑開了。</p>
<p>劉加斯問她道：『你偷看過嗎？』</p>
<p>他說：『啊，沒有，這樣變做欺騙了。』</p>
<p>他又問道：『領導你的小朋友待你怎麼樣？』</p>
<p>她說：『很好。可是輪到我去領別人的時候，我一定比他們還要當心。已經裝過瞎子的小朋友，領導別人的時候總很細心的。做瞎子真是苦事，先生，你自己要試試嗎？』</p>
<p>他沒有試，可是他領了她在學校各處走了一周，他把所看見的東西，講給她聽，她覺得很開心。這樣的走了一邊，他覺得自己心裏也充滿了慈祥之氣，很能關心別人的苦痛了。</p>
<h3 id="c108">妻子的力量 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— 金川</p>
<p>做妻子的，不僅如希特勒所說的供給戰塲上的戰士罷了，確能直接影響她丈夫的思想和事業。這裏我記起一件故事來了：</p>
<p>後漢時有個洛陽人叫樂羊子，一天，他在路上拾到一塊金子，滿想妻子看見了一定會很快活，所以　急急的回到家裏，欣然告訴他妻子，想不到妻子反而不快活起來，變色說道：「我聽見古人說過，孔子不飲盜泉之水，廉潔的不吃嗟來之食；何况去拾人家路上所遺失的東西，你太看不起你的人格了。」這一番話說得羊子入地無洞，於是依舊把拾來的金子放在路上。他覺悟到自己沒有學問了，於是就跑到遠處去求師，隔了一年，他又回到家裏，他的妻子跪著問他爲什麼回來，羊子回答說：「沒有別的事，不過因爲很久沒見面，懷念着你罷了。」他妻子突然變了色，拿著刀把織機的帛一刀割成兩段，說道：「這機上的帛是一根一根絲織成的，由絲而寸，由寸而匹，現在把0它割斷了，等於把日積月累的功夫一旦付與東流，你中斷你的求學，何異我割斷這帛！你自己想想吧。」羊子大大的感動了，他覺悟到一分時間的荒疏啼以影響到全部學業，於是再繼續去求他的學業。</p>
<p>這一類妻子影響丈夫的故事，在歷史上是不勝枚舉。如宋朝的王　氏，幫助丈夫秦檜作奸求榮，是很顯明的例子。所以我奉告有丈夫的同胞，時時督察和勸導丈夫，如發覺丈夫在囤積發國難財了，應該快快的苦諫他一人笑，萬人哭的勾當，何異在屠塲上舐血吃的飾餓狗？他容或一時糊塗了，你該快快的呼醒他，使他返向光明之路。現在正在暴風雨的時候，　匹夫匹婦的責任是一樣的。</p>
<p>人物</p>
<h3 id="c109">多才多藝的邱吉爾 <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— 陳師超</p>
<p>曾任英國首相溫世通邱吉爾，是個「快樂鬥士」，是美國收潮中的「主要角色」。「無時不準備赤手迎　，無時不向假想敵軸戮。」這兩句話，堪爲邱吉爾性格的寫照。</p>
<p>他歡喜參加各種的辯論。他對各種事物和無論甚麼人都採取敵對的態度，他所屬的保守黨，認他是個反抗最倔强和最難應付的黨員。他若是一時一刻不攻擊甚麼事物或人物，就覺得滿肚皮不舒服。經過了四十年的下議院生活，他還是反抗到底。</p>
<p>邱吉爾是世界上最多才多藝的一位人物。萬能　士的頭銜，他很可受之無愧色。三百六十行幾乎樣樣都會，又樣樣都幹過他曾歷任戰地通訊員，兵士，政治家，著作家，時裝專家，馬球運動員，泥水匠和庖丁。</p>
<p>以政治家而言，他所任的職務比英國現在的任何政治家爲多。本來衹有一個職位他還沒有做過，這個職位也就是他最垂涎欲得的—就是首相。現在竞連這個職位也給做到了。</p>
<p>一九三一年，英國國民內閣組成之後，邱吉爾幾乎成爲個政治棄兒。表面上他雖還是個保守黨黨員，但是因爲他的猛烈抨擊政府，事實上他的黨籍已經被鮑爾溫派開除了。</p>
<p>邱吉爾的高傲性格，他的愛好聲譽和權勢，可以說是由他的父親傳下來的。他的父親蘭道甫邱吉爾，是一位著名的保守黨政治家。母親是美國紐約哲羅姆的女兒珍妮。據說，他所賦有的那種美國人特殊好戰，喜歡冒險和傾向煽情主義，是由他的母親得來的。</p>
<p>溫世通於一九〇〇年回英後不久，就開始他的政治生活，那一年他被奧羅漢區選爲保守黨的卜議院議員。他和黨內領袖競爭六年之久。一九〇六年的總選前未幾，他突然加入自由黨，消息一播，全國人士，均爲震動。他的反對派叫他做「倒戈者」，一　見面就這樣稱他，使其無時或忘。</p>
<p>一九〇八年，邱吉爾以商務大臣資格，首次任閣員，但是他的紅運之來臨，却是在一九一一年，當時他被任爲海軍大臣，並受首相亞士葵的坦白訓令：「須將艦隊準備妥當，於受德國攻擊時可隨時應戰。」</p>
<p>一九二九年工黨富政之時，邱吉爾實爲麥唐納內閣坐立不安的針氈。到了一九三五年，在保守黨內，他才獲得插足的餘地。關於印度問題，黨中約有二分之一，贊成他的主張。第一次歐戰時邱氏任海相，應付裕如，所以這一次張伯倫首相不得不請他重爲馮婦，以收駕輕就熟之效，可見其槃槃大才堪任艱鉅之一般。邱氏生於一八七四年十一月三十日，結婚後，共育二女一男。</p>

<p>美國著名傳敎士兼著作家襲斯德博士在他所著「勝利的生活」一書中，對於笑的雅量，有這樣新穎的分析。他說：</p>

<p>最低微的人是始終不發笑的。</p>
<p>其次一種人只對自己所開的玩笑發笑。</p>
<p>更其次一種人只對別人所開的玩笑發笑。</p>
<p>最高尚的人是能够對他自己發笑的。因爲一個人具有對自己發笑的力量，足見得這個人能用客觀的態度審察自己。</p>

<p>今日上海話劇界，以團體劃分，有三大派，即上海劇藝社，中國旅行劇團，及猶未公演過的新藝劇團。</p>
<p>當上海劇藝社在璇宮出演時，今日新藝之幹部大半爲劇藝社中堅份子，迨「明末遺恨」上海多日以後，魏如晦　忽以小小人事關係退出劇藝社，其時中旅團長唐槐秋正來滬活動，遂與魏如晦等合作重振「中旅」，繼劇藝社而在璇宮演出，不久，劇藝社與辣婓劇塲訂約，掉至辣婓上演。此時，話劇界遂有上述兩大主流。</p>
<p>魏如晦等與「中旅」合作未久，亦以小小人事關係退出，另行組織新藝劇團，至是乃成目下之三派。</p>
<p>劇藝社之基礎，築於每一社員身上，以是比較鞏固，不致因一兩位幹部之意向而影響全社，「中旅」則職業性比較濃厚，故幹部須負最大責任；近來，唐槐秋以外間流言正多，故有努力幹去以事實作答復之決心；至新藝劇團，則尚未有何公關表現，內容不詳。總之，今日話劇界之所以成爲三派者，　山人事關係而起，無容諱言，私人間之不快之感，至今猶未消釋，若言劇運，豈非一大阻碍。此時此地，而有此現象，言之痛心！</p>

<p>Fancheng: The battle to annihilate the Japanese in Southern Henan and Northern Hubei has been extremely fierce in recent days. Since the Japanese have had their retreat routes completely cut off by the Chinese forces, they have no way to escape and are forced to make a last-ditch struggle. They launched a counter-offensive at one point but were crushed by the Chinese. The Japanese also attempted to put up a stubborn resistance at various strongholds near Zaoyang. More than 3,000 Japanese infantry and more than 2,000 cavalrymen in the area south of the Yanbukou-Chengjiahe-Sanhezhen line to the northwest of Zaoyang launched a fierce attack on the Chinese forces, attempting to break through, but failed. More than 2,000 Japanese infantry and cavalry, with four artillery pieces, launched an assault from Huanglongdang towards Luojiagang, north of Lieshan, but were intercepted by the Chinese. The fighting was extremely fierce, and they ultimately failed to break through. The remaining Japanese troops in Zushidian, south of Shuanggou, and at Baliwo and other places northwest of Shuanggou, have been almost completely wiped out by the Chinese forces. On the evening of the 12th, more than 1,600 Japanese troops, with four artillery pieces, who attempted to flee from Qifanggou towards Youpenggang and north of Zhangjiaji, were also met with a head-on attack by the Chinese forces. Fierce fighting is underway, with heavy Japanese casualties. After the Chinese army on the Xianghua Road recovered Jingmingpu, east of Zaoyang, they are now expanding east and west. Currently, all Japanese strongholds outside Zaoyang are under intensified siege by the Chinese forces. The remaining Japanese troops in Zaoyang are already trapped. The Chinese pursuit forces in Southern Henan have cleared out all the remaining Japanese troops in Magutian and Maoji in Minan and Tongbei. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Luoyang: As of now, the Chinese army has achieved a complete victory in the Southern Henan battles. All important towns and cities that were once harassed by the Japanese, such as Tanghe, Biyang, Tongbai, and Minggang, have been recovered by the Chinese. The main force of the Japanese has been almost completely crushed by the Chinese. The remaining Japanese troops in Southern Henan are fleeing in disarray towards Xinyang, with abandoned corpses and weapons scattered everywhere. The Chinese are pursuing the remaining Japanese troops and clearing the battlefield, while actively restoring local order and comforting the people. All county magistrates of Tanghe, Biyang, and Tongbai counties have returned to their cities one after another with their staff to resume official duties. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Fancheng: The railway from Donghuangdian to Lijiaji on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway was completely destroyed by the Chinese on the evening of the 8th. The Japanese immediately gathered more than a thousand troops to cover the repairs, but after fierce attacks by the Chinese day and night, more than 400 Japanese were killed, and the Japanese, unable to withstand the attacks, fled in defeat. Another unit of the Chinese forces captured Lianghekou, annihilating over a hundred Japanese troops. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Shashi: The Japanese troops who were routed from Zaoyang towards the south of Zhongxiang have been intercepted by the Chinese forces along the way and have now been cut into several segments. One unit, consisting of more than a thousand Japanese soldiers combined with logistics units, with more than ten artillery pieces and six to seven hundred packhorses, has been surrounded by the Chinese forces between Yangjiapeng and Majiaji. On the 11th, the Chinese forces narrowed the encirclement and launched a fierce attack, repelling the Japanese. By noon, more than 800 Japanese had been killed. The remaining Japanese troops are now crowded near Zhaiguan Mountain and Daquanliu. Another unit of the Japanese is trapped near Huangjiadashan and Xianju Mountain (south of Majiaji). After a courageous assault by the Chinese forces, Wangjiadashan and Xianju Mountain have both been recovered. The Japanese launched several fierce attacks, attempting to break out of the encirclement but failed. The Chinese army is pursuing them on multiple routes, aiming for a complete annihilation. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Sources here have confirmed that the Japanese troops who invaded Xiangfan in four routes on the 1st of this month are now retreating eastwards back to their bases near the Pinghan Railway. It is now known that the Chinese army commander did not engage the Japanese army in a frontal battle but concentrated the main force of the Chinese army behind the Japanese army. When the Japanese troops fled to the plains a few miles east of Fancheng, they suddenly discovered that the main force of the Chinese army was not in front of them but behind them, and thus began a general retreat. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Fancheng: After being repeatedly defeated by the Chinese forces, the remaining Japanese troops in the Henan-Hubei border area are fleeing in disarray in several groups. (1) A group of Japanese troops fleeing from the direction of Tanghe Yuantanzhen in Southern Henan were overtaken by the Chinese forces in the area west of Tongbai, and were also intercepted head-on by the Chinese army stationed there. In the fierce battle that lasted until midnight on the 12th, this group of Japanese troops was completely annihilated. Another group of Japanese troops fled east in a panic along the mountain paths south of the Nanque Highway. This morning, they were surrounded and attacked by the Chinese army in the Maojiguxian (both northwest of Xinyang) area. The Japanese immediately collapsed, and the Chinese forces are now sweeping the area. After recovering Liucun Railway Station, Riguo Temple, and Lijiazhai (all south of Xinyang) along the Pinghan Railway, the Chinese army launched fierce attacks on the Japanese troops along the railway. The remaining Japanese troops along the railway fled to the mountains west of the railway. The Chinese army, while thoroughly destroying the railway, pursued and swept up the remaining Japanese troops, achieving great gains. Furthermore, the Chinese army that recovered Minggang moved south along the Pinghan Line, and in the past few days, pursued and annihilated the defeated Japanese troops at Chashan, Gucheng, Xingji, and Wanggang (all north of Xinyang), killing more than 4,000 Japanese troops and capturing more than 700 warhorses, creating glorious battle achievements. (2) In the Northern Hubei area, a unit of Japanese troops was held back by the Chinese forces near Zaoyang. Last night, they gathered more than 20,000 troops, but their retreat routes have now been cut off, making it impossible for them to escape. This morning, they attempted to advance southeast under the cover of more than 50 tanks but were intercepted by the Chinese forces. The Japanese tank formation suffered heavy damage and fled. This unit of Japanese troops is still trapped near Zaoyang. Currently, the Chinese armies on all routes are launching a large-scale frontal action, pursuing the fleeing Japanese troops.

<p>Tunxi: After the Japanese troops in Southern Anhui attacked Xuancheng and were repelled by the Chinese forces, the Chinese army launched attacks on multiple routes. Strongholds such as Hantingzhen (east of the Qingyi River) and Henglang Mountain have been recovered, and the remaining Japanese troops have been completely cleared. They are now advancing towards Wanzhi and other places. (13th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Fancheng: The Chinese army has achieved an unprecedented victory in the battles of Southern Henan, Northern Hubei, and Central Hubei. The greatest success lies in its strategy. Today, a reporter asked a military officer about this point. According to the officer, the Japanese army's large-scale invasion of Southern Henan, Northern Hubei, and Central Hubei was based on a strategy of forming an encirclement, attempting to destroy the main force of the Chinese army, and then seize Xiangfan and other important locations in Southern Henan. This kind of deep and wide encirclement had a major weakness, namely that it could not be sustained for long, because the forces used were all on the encirclement line and not in strongholds. Strongholds can be defended for a long time, but a line cannot. Therefore, whether the Japanese army's encirclement was successful depended on a very short period of time. In other words, if the Chinese army wavered when the encirclement was completed, it would be a success. If the Chinese army could hold out for a little longer, the Japanese army would fail. This time, when the Japanese army formed the encirclement, the Chinese army not only did not waver but also intercepted the Japanese army everywhere when they distributed their thin forces along the long encirclement line, causing the Japanese the greatest pain. At the same time, the most thought-provoking thing was that the encirclement formed by the Japanese army this time did not encircle the main force of the Chinese army. Therefore, the main force of the Chinese army was always outside the Japanese army's encirclement line. When the Japanese army went deep and the opportunity was ripe, the main force of the Chinese army immediately completed a strong counter-encirclement against the Japanese army, launching a fierce attack on the Japanese flanks and rear, causing the Japanese army to collapse. Secondly, the Japanese army's main actions were generally not beyond the Chinese army's expectations. Therefore, the Chinese army knew everything clearly and was able to expand its encirclement as much as possible. As a result, the Japanese army's planned strategy was shattered by the Chinese army, and the Chinese army was able to take the initiative and create a favorable situation, leading the Japanese army to a disastrous defeat. In short, the Japanese army's failure this time did not meet the strategic principles in terms of time and space. On the contrary, the Chinese army was able to achieve a complete and thorough victory in this large-scale battle because its strategic application was in a perfect realm and had great creative value.

<h3 id="e12">On the Henan-Hubei Campaign <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>In his National Day address to the people last year, President Chiang Kai-shek pointed out that "We have now established a foundation in military affairs and will be able to win victory. All our frontline soldiers will be able to increasingly strengthen the revolutionary foundation, unleash the power of military affairs, and fulfill their duty as soldiers to defend the country and protect the race, so as to comfort the expectations of our compatriots." This kind of pronouncement has been proven time and again by the facts; and most recently, the Chinese army achieved another unprecedented victory in Southern Henan and Northern Hubei, further demonstrating the soundness and strength of the foundation for victory.</p>
<p>Japan's current policy towards China, although using traitors and puppets as a medium, seems to focus on political and economic offensives, but it still never gives up its dream of completing its aggression through military means. Initially, it was fully believed that the Chinese problem could be solved after the fall of Wuhan, but the facts of the past two years have proven that everything is not as Japan imagined. Although Japan has occupied a part of China's main transportation lines, the sides of the transportation lines are still under the control of the Chinese army, which can use mobile tactics at any time to cut off the transportation lines and threaten its important strongholds on the transportation lines. If Japan cannot use the so-called mopping-up war to eliminate the threats it faces, it is likely to be cut off inch by inch and attacked everywhere by China. But what has been the result of Japan's mopping-up war in the past year? The Eight Route Army's offensive in the Taihang Mountains suffered a crushing defeat; it fully expected to wipe out the Chinese army in Shanxi, but the graves awaited them everywhere; and it fully intended to cross the Yellow River southwards, hoping to wipe out the Chinese army in Northern Henan and invade Tongguan and Luoyang to advance into Guanzhong, but not only did the dream come to naught; but it repeated the mistakes of last year and suffered a head-on blow, and retreated in great defeat. Recently, it spent three months, mobilized 150,000 troops, and chose Xiangfan as the target, launching a large-scale third offensive; it believed that controlling Xiangfan would not only eliminate the threat to Wuhan, but also serve as an important base for invading Tongguan, Luoyang, and Sichuan; but unexpectedly, under the same goals as the previous two times, under the same strategy, it failed even faster than the previous two times, and suffered even heavier casualties. Its three attacks on Xiangfan and three great defeats at least prove that its defeats are not accidental, and China's victories are not fortunate, but have their inevitable conditions: First, the strategy commonly used by Japan against China is the roundabout encirclement, that is, rapid actions on both wings to inflict blows on the Chinese army, and the use of a cone-shaped breakthrough in the middle to break through the main force of the Chinese army: This strategy has not only been recognized by Chinese generals long ago, but also its troops are not enough to adapt to the needs of this strategy, its morale is declining, and it does not engage in fierce battles; and the Chinese army has strengthened the strength of its two wings and firmly defended the center, so Japan cannot achieve the effects it expected. Last year, the Japanese army invaded Northern Hubei, advancing on two routes, one feinting an attack on Shayang and the other directly approaching Suixian Yangzi; later, the Japanese army first encountered a serious blow from the Chinese army in Xinye and Tanghe, and at the same time, the Chinese army in Suixian Zaoyang destroyed transportation in the rear of the Japanese army, and the Japanese army collapsed. This time, the Japanese army's offensive still used that kind of roundabout encirclement strategy; it attacked Tongbai from Xinyang, Biyang from Changtaiguan, Tanghe from Suizao, and Changshoudian from Zhongxiang. The final goal of all routes of advancement was to annihilate the Chinese army and occupy Xiangfan. But the Chinese army was not only not encircled, but also achieved great success with a more wonderful strategy of multi-faceted mobile warfare. Second, the area of Northern Hubei and Southern Henan is partly a swampy area of the ancient Yunmeng Marsh east of the Han River and north of the Yangtze River, and partly a mountainous area of the Dahong Mountains and Tongbai Mountains; originally, the strength of the Japanese army was that its mechanized units were better than the Chinese army, and the plains were its most ideal battlefield; now it does not know its own limitations and advances into the mountainous and swampy areas, causing its own troops to suffer from hemiplegia, so it is right that it suffered a miserable defeat. Third, Japan does not give up its aggression, but wants to deceive the Chinese army and people with peace; as a result, of course, the Chinese side will not be fooled, but of course, the Japanese side has no fighting spirit, and how can it not be defeated. These three conditions are the main reasons for Japan's disastrous defeat, not to mention that the Chinese side has more factors for victory!</p>
<p>This unprecedented victory of the Chinese army not only gives international and domestic people a more correct understanding and a firmer confidence in the strength of China's resistance war, but also should make the Japanese warlords dispel their dreams of completing aggression through military means as soon as possible. The foundation of China's victory, as President Chiang Kai-shek said, has been established, and the urgent task for the soldiers and civilians of the whole country today is still to unleash their power and directly approach the final victory.</p>

<p>Tokyo: A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently stated that at 6:00 PM on Monday, British Ambassador Craig visited Foreign Minister Arita, holding a reply from the British government regarding Arita's opinion on the Dutch East Indies on May 11. Craig told Arita that the British government also shared the same concerns as the Japanese government regarding the Dutch East Indies, but believed that the Dutch forces in the Dutch East Indies were sufficient to maintain the status quo of the East Indian islands, and that the United Kingdom had no intention of interfering in these islands. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris: French Ambassador to Japan, Henri, held talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita today to discuss the issue of the Dutch East Indies Islands. Political figures here recently declared that what Japan wants to maintain is not only the territorial status quo of the islands, but also the economic status quo of the islands. The key to this issue, however, remains in the hands of the Dutch government, as the government of that country is free to decide how to use the resources of the islands, but it is believed that it will not intentionally hinder the interests that Japan has in the islands. It can be asserted that the governments of both Germany and the Soviet Union are now paying special attention to this issue, and both are wary of conflicts caused by the Dutch East Indies. Especially in view of the recent statements of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Japanese government seems to have understood that a prudent attitude is the most important thing.

<p>Tokyo: A spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that he believes that the Japanese government has no reason to change its long-standing policy of not participating in the European war due to Germany's invasion of the Netherlands, and also said that he believes that the status quo of the Dutch East Indies will not change even if Germany's invasion of the Netherlands has occurred, because US Secretary of State Hull has repeatedly stated that he will protect the status quo of the Dutch East Indies, and The Hague has also guaranteed that the status quo of the Dutch East Indies can be maintained. "We have 100% confidence in the guarantee made by the Dutch government." Regarding the issue of British and French troops in the Dutch West Indies, the Japanese government has not yet received formal notification, so it will not take public action for a while.

<p>London: Responsible parties here stated that the Allied countries first fully consulted with the Dutch government before deciding to send Allied troops to land on the islands of Curacao and Aruba in the Dutch West Indies to prevent the important oil refineries on the island from being sabotaged by conspiracies. Although the governor of the island has taken strong actions, it is considered necessary to have stationed troops to be able to immediately deal with any unforeseen circumstances. Once the Dutch government is satisfied that the safety of the island is fully established, or when sufficient Dutch troops are available for transfer, the British and French troops will withdraw from the island.

<p>Tokyo: The news that Allied troops have landed in Curacao and Aruba in the Dutch West Indies after consulting with the Dutch government, which came from London, is attracting much attention. People here say that this move is in clear contradiction with the statement issued by the Dutch government and the Dutch embassy in Tokyo on May 11, which stated that the Dutch government, regardless of the situation of the mother country, is able to maintain the independence of its overseas colonies and does not want to accept any proposals from any foreign country to protect its colonies, and the Dutch embassy also stated that the authorities of the Dutch West Indies have full power to rule their territory. People here also said that the steps taken by the Allied countries have indeed affected the Dutch East Indies issue, which is of great concern to Japan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is unwilling to make any criticism without receiving official reports on the matter, but it is heard that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs attaches great importance to this matter. Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Gu Zhenzhi and Director of the European Affairs Bureau Nishichunhiko held a meeting yesterday to exchange views on the matter. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The "Asahi Shimbun" reported that the Dutch ambassador to Japan recently visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to explain the situation of the occupation of Curacao Island in the Dutch West Indies by Allied troops.

The Dutch ambassador said that the Dutch government will not entrust a third country to protect the Dutch East Indies.

<p>Canberra - Opposition Leader Kou Ting-s recently delivered a speech here, mentioning the military importance of the Dutch East Indies to Australia in the event of any action by a certain major country currently maintaining conservative neutrality. He stated that he had requested the government to increase funding to strengthen the defenses of Darwin and certain areas on the northeast coast, as well as the coast of Queensland. Now that Australian troops have been dispatched to the Middle East, although there are reasons for incidents to erupt in the Middle East, considering the inviolability of Australia and the security relationship between the stability and friendship of the strategic islands of the Dutch East Indies and the safety of Australia, the Middle East is not as militarily important to Australia and New Zealand as some islands between Australia and the Suez Canal. Kou also stated that the opposition party's views on the war have remained consistent and denounced the tyrannical behavior of the aggressor nations in Europe. He said that if we believe that all the struggles in this war will not extend beyond the European continent, then we are harboring a mistaken notion of security. He believes that there are various reasons for Australia to be in a position to act swiftly and decisively when needed. This cannot be achieved without a large-scale organization and a reorganization of the defense forces, and the deployment of the defense forces must be such that they can be readily mobilized to meet emergency needs. We do not know where Australia needs to defend itself. The Middle East, where Australian troops have already been sent, is not within the actual war zone. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>

<p>Chongqing - Moscow News: The Soviet newspaper "Labor" published an article entitled "The Chinese Intellectual Class in the War of Resistance," stating that the Chinese intellectual class has actively engaged in the sacred war of resistance of the motherland, resisting Japanese imperialism's aggression against China and striving for national freedom. Students, teachers, and writers across the country have united to defend the motherland. Since the July 7th and August 13th Incidents, the Chinese army has risen up to resist, and the intellectual class and the good sons and daughters of the Chinese nation have participated in the war of resistance. They all possess an indomitable spirit. No matter how the Japanese act, how they wage war, or how terrible the methods of the traitors are, they still fight to the end with a fearless spirit. Patriotic organizations in the occupied areas operate in secret, combining righteousness and courage. Intellectuals across the country unanimously condemn those who surrender and traitors, helping the country to get rid of Japanese bondage and achieve national liberation and national independence. On the same day, the "Labor" newspaper also published an article describing the suffering of Japanese youth and workers, claiming that according to official statistics published by various Japanese newspapers, the wages of Japanese workers are decreasing daily, and workers in general are suffering from hunger and cold. Countless people are dying from illness. Young people often commit suicide because they cannot endure the pain of life. Even Japanese newspapers cannot deny this fact.

<h3 id="e23">Disaster Situation in Gaoyang <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Beiping - According to recent news from a British clergyman in Gaoyang County, southeast of Baoding, Gaoyang County, formerly a northern cotton industry center, has now become one of the most miserable disaster areas in Hebei Province. The local people are eating tree leaves, wheat sprouts, and mud. Moreover, these items must be sold for five cents per pound. The clergyman also stated that the American Changzhi Hospital in Baoding is currently engaged in epidemic prevention work in Baoding and its surrounding villages, in order to prevent the spread of epidemics caused by the disaster. The hospital has done its best in this regard. In addition to examining countless patients every day, all Chinese nurses often go to various villages to investigate their hardships. The Salvation Army, led by a German and composed of six people, is also doing its best to distribute food to those who are suffering the most. The stored grain is distributed once every ten days, and those in the most difficult situations are given priority. Apart from this method, it is impossible to carry out more widespread relief or estimate the number of refugees and patients, as there are thousands of people who gather in the streets to beg during the day and live in abandoned houses at night. The mortality rate of these people cannot be investigated. According to those who have witnessed the results of the disaster in the same area in 1921, these disaster victims can be saved if they can prolong their lives for another two months, because the wheat sown in winter has already begun to flourish and will be ripe by early July. The area could have grown sorghum, but the planting of sorghum was prevented by the Japanese in order to prevent guerrillas from hiding in the sorghum fields. Among the disaster-stricken areas, the scene in Gaoyang is the most desolate. The rich have all fled elsewhere, and those who remain are surviving by selling a very small number of miscellaneous items. All industry and commerce have completely stagnated. Many people are forced to eat tree leaves, and some even pick the flowers blooming on the trees in their neighbors' courtyards to eat. These people no longer eat tree bark, perhaps because the supply of this "food" is already scarce. (United Press dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e24">Yu Bin Gives Public Lecture in Guiyang <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Guiyang - Bishop Yu Bin gave a public lecture tonight at the invitation of the Anti-Japanese Support Association, entitled "The Current Stage of American Aid to China." He briefly stated that the United States' consistent policy towards the Pacific and China for the past forty years can be seen in its entirety in the Nine-Power Treaty. Since the war of resistance, he has traveled abroad twice, visiting Europe and the United States, and deeply feels that the American people have the clearest understanding of China and the most sincere friendship. The facts of aid to China over the years, as well as the declaration denying the "New Order in East Asia" and the puppet organizations, can be taken as clear evidence. The American naval community in particular regards the bombing of the "Panay" as a great disgrace and cannot forget it, because the United States is a world power and will never allow others to undermine its dignity. However, it is regrettable that the United States has not implemented an embargo, but he believes that humanitarianism and justice will eventually punish the violent powers. China's war of resistance was originally a self-reliant effort and a struggle for world peace. While international sympathy and assistance should be warmly welcomed, we should not expect too much or demand it too urgently, but must base it on mutual trust and understanding in order to enhance eternal friendship.

<p>Tokyo - After Professor Abe Isoo, a member of the Japanese House of Representatives and leader of the Social People's Party, recently initiated the organization of the "Labor People's Party," Minister of Home Affairs Kodama Hideo recently issued an order to prohibit it and issued a statement explaining the reasons for this move. He briefly stated that Abe and his staff are deeply rooted in Marxist ideology and are determined to incite class struggle. If the party were to be established, it would weaken the national unity and hinder the smooth resolution of the "China Incident." Therefore, the decision was made to prohibit it. The Yomiuri Shimbun recently commented on this, briefly stating: "During the last European war, democracy and Marxism in Japan suddenly became rampant, and Japan suffered greatly. Based on past lessons, the measures currently taken by the government are extremely timely. It is hoped that the government will continue to take effective measures to monitor all ideas and inappropriate actions that are not welcome in Japan." Regarding this matter, the General Confederation of Labor feels quite uneasy and generally believes that the government's second step may be to dissolve various labor unions, so that the labor organization presided over by the government, the so-called "National Industrial Service Movement," which aims to promote labor-management cooperation, can be stimulated and developed. However, Professor Abe himself is quite calm about this matter. He said: "Everyone should abide by the laws and regulations promulgated by the government, and I have no complaints. I have no intention of filing an appeal at this time and will take a break for a while." (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>Tokyo - It has recently been learned that General Kobayashi Seizo, the Governor-General of Taiwan, will soon submit his resignation. It may be succeeded by General Nomura Kichisaburo, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs. According to the Miyako Shimbun, General Kobayashi has been the Governor-General of Taiwan for five years and has made many contributions to the development of Taiwanese industry and the Japanization of the natives. However, recently he suddenly had the desire to retire. The Japanese Navy Ministry attaches great importance to Taiwan because it is close to Nanyang and is a base for controlling southern China, and advocates that a naval officer should serve as the Governor-General. However, whether Nomura will succeed him in the future has not yet been fully determined. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3 id="e28">European War Has Entered Decisive Phase, Observations of London Newspapers <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>London - This morning, various newspapers here admitted that the war has entered a decisive phase where Hitler is making a desperate gamble, and expressed satisfaction with the establishment of Churchill's new cabinet. The diplomatic correspondent of the Times stated that although the news from the Netherlands and Belgium is quite chaotic, there is no doubt that Hitler and his generals want to determine victory or defeat in a single summer offensive. At the beginning of the war, Hitler was still hesitant, hoping that Britain and France would fall into the trap of his peace proposals. However, after France was not moved by propaganda and the British people also demanded intensified warfare to respond to Germany's hypocritical peace plan, Hitler suddenly realized that it was not enough to win by relying on peace proposals, and that victory must be sought in the war itself. The correspondent then analyzed the paths that Hitler could follow: (1) Wait for an opportunity to establish a strong living space in the Balkans through diplomatic and economic pressure and import goods from the Soviet Union, while witnessing the substantial progress of the Allied military preparations, or (2) Launch a decisive attack with the German military force, which has reached its peak. In addition to the military evidence that proves that the decisive battle has just begun, we also have a cumulative understanding of Hitler's psychology and policies. Hitler has always wanted to create his army for sudden attacks and has absolute confidence in the final desperate gamble. German generals and industrialists know quite well the extent of this gamble. According to news received in London, they pointed out to Hitler that although Germany's preparations are large, they are strictly limited. Steel supplies seem to be able to meet the needs of six months of wartime (full-scale war will consume it even faster). Supplies of alloy steel and major base metals are more abundant, but copper is scarce and can hardly be obtained except from Vladivostok. If judged on the basis of a full-scale war, the oil supply is only sufficient for a few months, and the subsequent shortages will be impossible to make up. At present, Germany can still meet the need for 8 million tons per year, but it is feared that it will become a problem to maintain the supply of 18 million to 20 million tons required on the basis of a full-scale war. In addition, Germany has been saving railway maintenance costs for many years. Even if bombing is not taken into account, the needs of large-scale warfare alone will make Germany's railways unable to cope and lead to delays and even collapse. Although the German people are trying to keep the above situation secret, London can still find out about it. Hitler underestimates the preparations of the Allied countries. Hitler may be worried about the possibility of failure, but even if Germany fails, it may not collapse immediately, but even in terms of attack, Germany cannot withstand a long-term siege, nor can it restore its current military production. Therefore, we can believe that Hitler, now that he is personally directing the troops on the Western Front, will first use his forces and the terror of modern warfare, and does not want himself and his country to suffer this setback.

The British Air Force's assistance to the Dutch forces has been very effective; (2) In Belgium, enemy forces continue to advance on Belgian troops west of Maastricht and in the Tongeren area.

<p>The Hague: A communiqué from the Dutch Army Headquarters has been released here, stating that German troops have crossed the rivers Lies and IJssel. The Dutch army has retreated from part of the area according to plan. During the retreat, Dutch aircraft bombed the advancing German troops. The northern provinces have no defenses, so the Dutch army retreated in good order. Furthermore, according to sources here, French troops have made contact with the enemy in Brabant Province. Many of the German paratroopers who landed in various locations have been wiped out and are no longer a threat. The remaining fleeing German soldiers are currently being rounded up. Several German paratroopers seized a bus and opened fire on civilians, but were attacked by Dutch troops, forced to surrender. According to official announcements, the Waalhaven airfield in Rotterdam was heavily bombed by the Dutch, rendering it useless to the enemy even if captured. German troops in Rotterdam are currently being cleared out. The Dutch Navy is cooperating with the Army to defend the country. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

German troops have occupied the provinces of Groningen and Friesland within two days and have reached the North Sea. Harlingen is north of the Zuiderzee dike, 120 kilometers from the German border. Groningen Province has an area of 2,368 square kilometers and a population of 419,000. The provincial capital, Groningen, has a population of 120,000 and is the sixth-largest city in the Netherlands.

<p>Berlin: Between the Dutch Zuiderzee and the Rhine River, there are several lines of defense. The first line of defense is the IJssel Line, from the mouth of the IJssel River to Aachen. Forty kilometers west of this line is the Grebbe Line, from Hilversum to Rhenen. South of the Waal River (the name of the Rhine River in the Netherlands) is the Peel Line between Rhenen and Roermond. The Dutch authorities have built many obstacles and fortresses to enhance their defense, but have failed to stop the German advance. (Haitong, 13th)</p>

The fortress is said to be the center of the Meuse River defenses, and its mission is to prevent the enemy from crossing the Meuse River and the Albert Canal. The fortress has many gun emplacements equipped with long-range and short-range cannons. The fortress is surrounded by barbed wire and has tank traps. The fortress is garrisoned by 1,200 soldiers. Since German troops occupied it in a short time, the defensive capabilities of the outdated Maginot Line have become questionable. (Haitong, 13th)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to Monday's report, the German Air Force sank a British battleship with a single bomb yesterday and occupied the port of Liège, confirming the existence of new German weapons. The port of Liège is one of the most important and strongest fortresses in Europe, equipped with 28-centimeter caliber cannons. The general staff of Britain, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands jointly formulated a plan, considering it a cornerstone of resistance against Germany.

<p>German Troops Attack Liège; Belgian Troops Resist Heroically</p>
<p>Paris: Military sources here recently commented that since German troops invaded the three countries of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, the two sides have been engaged in combat for four days, but this is still only a preliminary battle. The major battle is still brewing. Here is a summary of the situation on each front: (1) Enemy forces are attacking the city of Liège in Belgium from two directions, north and south. The area was originally a Belgian defense zone, and Belgian troops are resisting heroically and are quite successful. However, the area between the Albert Canal and the Meuse River has been occupied by German troops. German heavy armored vehicle units are advancing from Maastricht towards the cities of Tongeren and Hasselt. However, due to the rapid arrival of British and French Allied forces, they have encountered significant difficulties. The air forces and mechanized units of Britain and France have launched fierce attacks on enemy units and their supply trains, inflicting heavy damage. Aircraft from these countries have also bombed German rear transportation lines on the east bank of the Meuse River. In the Tongeren area, our motorized units launched a major counter-offensive against enemy forces yesterday afternoon. This is the first time our tank units have made contact with enemy mechanized units, and fierce fighting is still ongoing. Judging from the progress of this battle, it can be seen that our tank units are no less capable than those of Germany. (2) Enemy forces in the northern Netherlands have broken through several strongholds, but Dutch troops are still able to hold their positions. The threat posed by enemy paratroopers in the interior of the country was originally very serious, but the situation has improved this morning, and most of the areas have been cleared. (3) Regarding the war situation in Luxembourg, our advance units have withdrawn from the front line to the Belgian province of Luxembourg, but the main force is concentrated in the area from the Moselle River to Longwy. Longwy is still in our hands. (4) German troops also launched an attack on our forces in the Moselle River area on the Western Front yesterday. A German division advanced, but was immediately blocked by our forces. (Havas, 13th)</p>

<p>London: Prime Minister Churchill presented a brief speech to the House of Commons on the resolution to require confidence in the new cabinet. He said, "Our goal in this war is to obtain the final victory on land, sea, and air at any cost and no matter how difficult. If the war is lost, the country will hardly survive. Therefore, we should use all the strength that God has given us to fight against the unprecedented tyranny in human history." All members of Parliament, regardless of party affiliation, applauded their approval. The Prime Minister then presented the resolution and asked the House of Commons to pass it. Labour Party MP Smith then spoke, expressing his congratulations to Churchill on his appointment as Prime Minister. Liberal Party MP Sir Harris also praised the Prime Minister as "strong and imaginative". Another Conservative MP spoke, saying that Lord President of the Council Chamberlain's bright and upright attitude was a model for the country. Former Liberal Prime Minister Lloyd George said that all subjects of Britain and the British Empire were prepared to sacrifice for Prime Minister Churchill. However, Independent Labour Party MP Maxton opposed the Prime Minister's proposed resolution. As a result of the vote in the House of Commons, it was unanimously passed. Although Maxton and another Independent Labour Party MP Campbell cast negative votes, according to parliamentary rules, these two votes were not recorded. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>London: The House of Commons convened this afternoon. When the new Prime Minister Churchill and the new cabinet members arrived in the House, all members of Parliament warmly welcomed the Prime Minister and Lord President of the Council Chamberlain (the former Prime Minister). Prime Minister Churchill immediately proposed a resolution stating, "The new cabinet is sufficient to represent the country's determination to continue the war against Germany and seek final victory. The House of Commons hereby welcomes it." After a brief discussion on this case, the House of Commons unanimously passed it with 381 votes to 0. This is the first major victory for the new cabinet. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>London: When Churchill attended the House of Commons for the first time today as Prime Minister, the entire House cheered loudly. Former Prime Minister Chamberlain entered the House after him and received the same welcome. When he walked to the government seats and sat next to the new Prime Minister, the entire House cheered again, which lasted for several minutes before stopping. On Churchill's other side was Lord Privy Seal Attlee. When he took his seat, he was also warmly cheered. Before Churchill rose to speak, the new Secretary of State for War Eden first answered a question in the House about the danger of German paratroopers landing in Britain, saying that he hoped to be able to announce something about this matter soon. Churchill then rose to speak, and the entire House cheered again. The gist of Churchill's speech was that after being ordered to form a cabinet, he immediately began to search for talent from all parties, and has now completed most of the work. The appointment of the remaining cabinet members will be announced soon. Our only goal is victory, and we will do our best no matter how difficult the process. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>London: Prime Minister Churchill has just announced the second list of cabinet members as follows:</p>
<p>Lord Chancellor: Sir Simon, National Liberal Party</p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer: Sir Wood, Conservative Party</p>
<p>Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security: Sir Anderson, Conservative Party (re-appointed)</p>
<p>Colonial Secretary: Lord Lloyd, Conservative Party</p>
<p>President of the Board of Trade: Duncan, Conservative Party (re-appointed)</p>
<p>Minister of Supply: Herbert Morrison, Labour Party Executive Committee Member</p>
<p>Minister of Information: Duff Cooper, Conservative Party Faction</p>
<p>Prime Minister Churchill also went to Buckingham Palace this afternoon to meet with King George VI and reported on the cabinet formation matters. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>London: After Prime Minister Churchill announced the second list of cabinet members, political figures here commented that the transfer of former Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir Simon to Lord Chancellor and the transfer of former Lord Privy Seal Sir Wood to Chancellor of the Exchequer were unexpected and might cause dissatisfaction in some quarters in the country. The former Chairman of the London County Council, Morrison, an executive member of the Labour Party, is known for his competence. His appointment as Minister of Supply will be welcomed by all parties. In addition, according to well-informed sources, Morrison has close ties with the trade unions and will be able to contribute greatly to the development of industry to meet the needs of the war. At the same time, it is rumored that the General Secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union, Bevin, one of the leaders of the Trades Union Congress, will also be appointed as Minister of Labour. If so, the two will certainly complement each other. One theory is that former Colonial Secretary MacDonald will be transferred to Minister of Health, while Conservative Party faction leader Amery (former Colonial Secretary) will be appointed as Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. The former Secretary of State for Air, Sir Hoare, is almost universally dissatisfied, and it is feared that he will be difficult to continue to participate in the cabinet. In addition, the Liberal Party figures Sir Harris and Lord Samuel are rumored to be taking on secondary cabinet positions. (Havas, 12th)</p>

<p>Rome – Anti-British slogans were found on the streets of Rome yesterday, causing disturbances. The incident occurred when a British man and three friends, including a British woman and an American scholar, tore down a slogan, leading to an assault by Blackshirt members, who chased them into a hotel. When the British Chargé d'Affaires, Noel, intervened, anti-British slogans were also plastered on his car. However, after Noel telephoned the Italian Foreign Ministry, the slogans on the car were removed. Fascist extremists are also very active. Last night, they burned many copies of the Vatican's newspaper, "L'Osservatore Romano," on the street. The newspaper, which is published impartially, is bought up in its entirety as soon as it is delivered to newsstands to prevent the public from buying and reading it. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>

Therefore, we believe that the new British government's Far East policy will not deviate from its position of upholding the Nine-Power Treaty and non-recognition of puppet regimes. At this time of the establishment of the new British government, we hope that Britain will adopt a more active policy in the Far East and take joint action with the United States to help China resist Japan, so that Japan will not enjoy the fisherman's benefit in the increasingly spreading European war.

<p>London – Belgian Prime Minister Pierlot broadcast to the Belgian people last night, detailing the military situation without any concealment, stating that on Friday, the German army failed to penetrate deeply into Belgium at any point. Belgium immediately and thoroughly implemented demolition work along the border, which hindered the German advance. However, north of the Albert Canal yesterday, the officer who was ordered to blow up the two bridges below Maastricht was killed by enemy aircraft bombs before he could carry out his mission, allowing the German army to occupy the two bridges and allowing motorcades to cross the river. However, soon after, another officer penetrated the German lines, went straight to where the mines were buried, disregarded his life and blew up one bridge, sacrificing himself heroically. Therefore, the enemy only had one bridge to pass through. After crossing the bridge, the German army launched a fierce attack on the Belgian army under the cover of a large number of tanks and aircraft. Although the Belgian army resisted fiercely, they had to retreat to Tongeren. In the afternoon, the Belgian army launched a counterattack with motorcades and aircraft, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy, but only managed to prevent them from advancing and could not push them back. In the evening, the German vanguard sneaked near Wavre. The Belgian headquarters took various steps necessary for the situation that day, so the enemy was prevented from advancing when they reached the new positions defended by the Belgian people. According to the latest reports, the enemy is trying to attack again. A total of 100 enemy aircraft were shot down that day. The Allied Air Force participated in important air battles from early morning, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. East and north of the Albert Canal, the Belgian army's resistance was effective, and the lines have not been broken. The enemy launched multiple fierce attacks on the defenses of the Liège area, but were all repelled. The slopes of the fortress are covered with enemy corpses. On the right bank of the Meuse River in Luxembourg Province, the Belgian army was attacked by a larger number of enemy troops, and finally retreated according to plan after a fierce battle. French motorcades attacked the German army in Luxembourg Province, and part of the province has fallen into German hands. Paratroopers who landed in Brussels and other places are currently being searched for. The progress of the Allied forces is very satisfactory. The enemy is spreading various rumors, such as the Belgian government planning to leave the capital, all of which are false. It is hoped that the people will not be fooled by them. The government asks the people to remain calm. The military situation is not unfavorable, but difficult times are inevitable. The headquarters is taking swift measures and the army is able to use its orders, so the situation is not a problem. It is hoped that the people will unite and believe in the final victory. With the help of the Allied forces, we will eventually win. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Brussels – Foreign Minister Spaak delivered a broadcast speech tonight, explaining the circumstances under which Belgium was forced to go to war, stating in brief, "The King and the government have done everything possible to prevent our country from being involved in the vortex of war. Who knows that we will finally suffer aggression. This is the second time in 25 years that our country has suffered aggression. Its horror is even greater than in 1914. In the past three days, the German army has launched fierce attacks, and no fewer than hundreds of civilians have died in various places. Fortunately, our soldiers have been brave and selfless in fighting the enemy. Our country takes the last European war as a model. Although we have suffered setbacks, we will never give in. Although our country has always been peaceful, but at this moment, we have decided to fight for independence. The people of the whole country are loyal and courageous in defending the country under the leadership of the King. In a word, there is no so-called party at this time. There is only the entire nation united to resist foreign aggression. As far as diplomacy is concerned, our country is fighting alongside Britain and France, and the troops of these countries have joined our elite troops to contact the enemy. Another page of history has begun, and it is expected that the result will be the same as the last European war, that is to say, justice will prevail over power. On the one hand, we deeply rely on the British and French Allied forces, and we should do our duty without fear." (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3 id="e45">Since the Fall of Shantou, Everything Has Changed in the Past Year The Cunning and Those Seeking to Survive Should Be Aware All Assets of Foreign Firms and Shops Have Been Occupied <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: There is a truth in society that is true and false, good and evil, black and white, good and violent. These are two classes in society that should not be confused or reversed by the world. Three years ago, the society in eastern Guangdong was very chaotic. It was difficult for journalists to distinguish who was a true patriot and who was an organization with integrity. It was really difficult to distinguish between fake and genuine, gentlemen and villains. However, since Shantou fell on June 21 last year, it has created a wonderful division for the society in eastern Guangdong: (1) The white, the true, the kind, the capable, the loyal, and the loving were driven out. (2) The black, the false, the vicious, the shameless, the cunning, and the murderous were promoted. (3) The gray, the confused, the cowardly, the compromising, the surviving, and the muddleheaded were reduced to dregs. This division is very beneficial to the future of the survival of the Chinese nation. The ancients said, "Misfortune is where fortune leans; fortune is where misfortune lurks." People who read books to death, put themselves in this era, and are tested and tempered, feel that this eyewitnessed experience is better than reading ten thousand books. It is indeed not insignificant for our lifelong conduct.</p>
<p>We have seen those sincere, patriotic, and kind people suffer all kinds of hardships, hunger, and disease. Although the suffering is bitter, their hearts are at peace, and they will never be disappointed in the future. Another kind of people, then, take advantage of their power, are arrogant, and are surrounded by others. They eat tens of thousands of dollars in one meal. They seem very happy, but they are in the cage of a living hell, unable to cry or laugh. Their thoughts, words, and actions are not free. They do not know whether they will have life tomorrow. There are also most people who, at first, hoped that everyone would contribute money and lives to protect their families and property. Then, they became servile and flattering, kowtowing and smiling, so as not to have their wives and children humiliated and their whole families starve to death. They thought they were the most clever and cunning, but in the end they were the most stupid and incompetent. They are in a cage, unable to live or die. The evolution of the grassroots society in eastern Guangdong has been a spectacle of the world in the past year.</p>
<p>"No matter who is the emperor, the people only have to pay grain." This was the most popular traitorous theory before the fall of Shantou. Some people were still delusional that "it would be better for foreign soldiers to come, foreign rice would be tax-free, and everyone would have cheap rice to eat. The government allows a small amount of foreign rice to be imported tax-free, but sets up companies to hoard grain. That is the government seizing food from the people. What is the use of such a government coming?" These thoughts and theories are very heartbreaking. Now, the iron-like facts show you that you hope to eat cheap rice, and you are not even shown the bag of quick rice. You want to eat cakes, and they give you a snake. You want to keep your private commercial property. If you do not obey the order to evacuate and move away, everything left in the occupied area, except for the clear breeze, bright moon, air, and seawater, you are not allowed to freely enjoy or possess. Not to mention that you have no share in anything, even your own body, wife, and children are no longer your own. Mines, beaches, land, houses, factories, schools, young girls, and children under the age of twelve are all snatched away by those who "promote peace". What is there to say? What lawsuits can be filed?</p>
<p>However, we are absolutely not pessimistic. The children of light will eventually join the camp of light. Before the offspring of snakes die, they have already entered the living hell. Just imagine, in a group of jackals, how can the existence of lambs be promised? In a garden of thorns, how can beautiful lilies grow? Look, at the moment of great social change, there are many moving and tragic stories left behind for everyone to see. One look will wake you up.</p>
<p>(1) The railways, highways, automobiles, inland river steamships, water plants, electricity bureaus, large hotels, Western-style houses, everything in Shantou City, were unconditionally occupied by Fuda Company and ×× Association. Later, someone shouted for economic cooperation. You think, the private property has already been completed, who would be willing to take money out again to start a business and prosper the market? In the future, only the Japanese themselves will create and prosper with their own hands. They have no money, they can only print military tickets. Military tickets cannot buy materials abroad. Of course, no one accumulates regular assets. Even the Japanese and Taiwanese people do not believe in those military tickets. They often exchange them for Chinese legal currency for storage. Therefore, Shantou City has been lost for nearly a year. There is not a single newly built house, and there are no newly purchased items. Apart from foreign firms, no shops can be seen importing goods. The opening of foreign firms is equivalent to a material exchange shop. The Japanese spread military tickets in the market, and the people get them, and still buy things from foreign firms, which is equivalent to a cash exchange. They monopolize the Chaoshan market, and its meaning is very simple, nothing more than that. National capital and remittances from overseas Chinese continue to flow into the interior.</p>
<p>(2) Shantou to Pinglu Chengsheng Company was opened by Cai Shishan of Chao'an, acting as an agent for Hong Kong foreign firms to sell electric light machines, generators, automobiles, etc., earning a lot of profit every year. Last year, Hua Zhenzhong, the Brigade Commander of the Chinese Army, ordered the valley factories and shops to move their goods away. Chengsheng Company alone disobeyed the order and did not move. At that time, there were rumors that an activity fee was needed to postpone the move. For example, a certain match factory was forced to move, and paid a certain amount of money to postpone it for a month. The Chaoshan Railway was forced to demolish its tracks. After Zhang Fuying, the person in charge of the railway, went to Shaoguan for activities, it could be demolished to Anbu. The function of evacuating materials was just that someone wanted to make a fortune from the national disaster. How difficult it was to hire boats and workers when moving, and how difficult it was for government personnel to check along the way. Those who spread rumors and slandered the government added fuel to the fire, which is very regrettable. Well, the world has changed. People who cannot bear the suffering will eventually be eliminated. Those who make a fortune from the national disaster have left the anti-Japanese war camp. The facts before our eyes are that the railways, electric lights, and water companies that were not thoroughly destroyed at that time are now in the pockets of the Japanese, and Chengsheng Foreign Firm and Zhihexiang Hardware Store have all been sealed up. They falsely thought that once the war started, goods could not be imported, and the goods they had in stock could be sold at high prices, and they ridiculed Gongchang Company for transporting the machines to Meixian with great difficulty and spending huge transportation fees. They were stored like antiques, which was really not worth it. Zhang Gongjian, the person in charge of Gongchang, said that my machines were transported to Meixian, even if they could not be sold, I would rather give them to the government for free. However, Cai Shishan of Chengsheng Company made his own private calculations and had no foresight. He was sealed up by the Japanese. He still wanted to make a fortune, which is really ridiculous. Twenty cars were not assembled, along with fifteen generators. Cai said to the Japanese that these were items consigned by foreign firms. The Japanese replied, "You can open a list according to the price." We want to buy them all and move them all away. Chengsheng did open a list to the Japanese special service agency to collect the money, once, twice, and more than ten times. He received a reply saying, "Your government owes my government money. When the reparations are settled in the future, this money will be settled." I will sign for you. It is considered that I have counted a certain amount. You don't have to come again in the future. The copper and iron utensils of Zhihexiang Hardware Store were sealed for many days. After spending several thousand yuan to ask someone to unseal it, the goods were prohibited items and were all moved away and taken care of. There is also a family, which is Yixing Tea Store in Shengping Street. In previous years, it pretended Taiwan tea to be Fujian tea, earning more than 100,000 yuan a year. In every patriotic movement, he had a way to do business. Tea was transported to the Taiwanese warehouse, repackaged, and transported to various ports in Nanyang as Fujian tea. He later made good friends. This time, when the Japanese soldiers came, he thought it was their world. Unexpectedly, the signboard, store location, shelves, stored tea, and all the equipment were rented by a Japanese, who wrote back an IOU and drove away the Yixing partners and owners, and the business continued as usual every day. Tea was shipped from Taiwan to Shantou. The above is just a brief account of a few things. There are still many large companies that have changed their owners without a sound.</p>

<p>Failed to Borrow Military Expenses from Puppet Troops</p>
<p>Throw Grenades to Intimidate</p>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: The Main Street outside the North Gate of Xiyi has always been a prosperous urban area. Since it was burned down during the fall, a small number of shops have built simple houses and barely operate. However, the original Wan Da Nanhua Store was not destroyed and is still managed by Miao Dongchen, and the business is still good, which is coveted by the puppet troops. At about 8 p.m. on the third day, two puppet soldiers entered the store and asked Miao to borrow 3,000 yuan for military expenses. Miao replied that he did not have this huge sum of money at the moment and offered to collect 200 yuan. Unexpectedly, they did not get what they wanted, and immediately threw a grenade into the store hall, which exploded instantly, wounding two employees, Ding Linbao and Sun Xiaopei, in their legs. They were carried to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. Afterwards, Japanese soldiers rushed to the scene and used the pretext of arresting the murderer to cut off traffic and search nearby shops, causing great disturbances.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Zhejiang Province Intensifies the Elimination of Illiteracy Popularizes Basic National Education It is Decided to Hold 6,000 Short Classes in the First Year Increase People's Schools to Eliminate 800,000 Illiterates <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>(Fangyan Correspondence) Zhejiang Province's three-year governance plan focuses on eliminating illiteracy and popularizing basic national education for education and cultural construction, and simultaneously implements compulsory education and vocational education for unemployed people. The implementation methods and progress have been separately specified as follows:</p>
<p>A. Intensify the implementation of compulsory education (1) In counties and districts where the number of school-age children enrolled has not reached 80% of the standard set by the ministry, continue to implement a one-year short-term compulsory education. Those who have reached the standard will begin to implement a two-year short-term compulsory education. Each short-term primary school class will be set up with one or two classes in the joint national school of every two or four Bao as the standard. The required expenses will be subsidized by the central and provincial governments by four-tenths and two-tenths respectively, the county will raise one-fourth, and the townships will also raise one-fourth. (2) Each county will appropriately increase the number of mobile schools. (3) The province will issue detailed and concrete methods for compulsory enrollment and order the counties to implement them effectively. (4) Hold centralized training classes for short-term primary school teachers. (5) The province will centrally supply short-term primary school textbooks. (6) The province and counties will increase the number of compulsory education supervisors to strictly assess the management of short-term primary schools. (7) The province will formulate methods for rectifying private schools and order the counties to implement them effectively to supplement the inadequacy of compulsory education. (8) In accordance with the minimum equipment standards, equipment for primary schools at all levels will be enriched in stages. (9) Enlarge the number of students in primary schools at all levels. (10) Supervise all primary schools to expand sports fields. (11) Instill common sense of medicine and hygiene to primary school teachers, and compile and print health reading materials to promote the physical and mental health of children. (12) Promulgate unified rules and regulations related to primary school administration, teaching, and moral education. (13) Implement counseling work. (14) Strictly assess the management situation, reward excellent primary schools, and banish bad primary schools. The implementation progress of the above methods: 1. Each county in the province will set up one or two short-term primary school classes in the joint national primary school of every two or four Bao as the standard, with a total of 6,000 short-term primary school classes. Two thousand classes will be added in the second and third years respectively. 2. In the eighth item, single-grade primary schools in the first year should reach the first stage of the minimum equipment standard, and multi-grade primary schools should reach the second stage of the minimum equipment standard. The second and third years should be enriched separately and reach the second, third, and fourth stages of the minimum equipment standard. 3. In the tenth item, the sports fields of township central schools and primary schools with four or more grades in the first year should be expanded to at least one mu (calculated as 30 square city feet per student). In the second and third years, the sports fields of primary schools with less than four grades should be expanded to one mu. 4. The remaining items will be held separately from the first year. B. Intensify the implementation of vocational education for out-of-school people (1) In addition to the regulations stipulated in the Ministry's revised regulations on people's schools, each county and city in the province should establish people's schools separately by people's groups, factories, and shops, one adult class and one women's class should be set up in each national school for every two or four Bao, with each class enrolling 50 out-of-school people as the standard. Counties and districts where national schools have not been set up should independently establish wartime people's schools. (2) In accordance with the methods promulgated by the ministry, intellectual elements should be mobilized to teach voluntarily. (3) Set up training classes for people's teachers to cultivate teachers for people's education. (4) The textbooks required for adult classes and women's classes in each national school and wartime people's schools will be allocated by the Ministry of Education and used. (5) The funds required for vocational education for out-of-school people in each county will be prepared based on the number of out-of-school people in each county. The annual implementation of the vocational education budget will be submitted to the province for approval, and the central and provincial governments will each subsidize one-third. (6) A number of social education supervisors will be set up separately in the province and counties, responsible for conscientiously handling inspection and guidance matters. The implementation progress of the above methods is to eliminate 800,000 illiterates in the first year and eliminate 1 million illiterates in each of the second and third years. Each item will be held separately from the first year.</p>

<p>Teachers of Shanghai-Registered Schools Can Also Register (Shaoguan Airmail Report) The Guangdong Education Department, in order to assist the evacuated teachers and staff from war zones and facilitate the registration of staff and students, has specially established registration procedures. Registration stations are set up in the following seven locations: (1) Qujiang, (2) Gaoyao, (3) Fengshun, (4) Huiyang, (5) Kaiping Changsha, (6) Suixi, (7) Kowloon. Teachers and staff of all levels of schools and students evacuated from the war zones can apply for registration at the registration stations. Teachers who have taught at registered schools in Hong Kong, Macau, Guangzhou Bay, or Shanghai, and are currently unemployed, can register at the Kowloon or Suixi station. Teachers and staff of all levels of schools who pass the registration will be issued national currency of thirty to seventy yuan respectively (depending on the distance of their journey) to report to the Education Department in Shaoguan. The Education Department will then assess their qualifications and abilities and assign them to work in administrative agencies or schools, provide short-term training, or assign them to the middle and primary school service corps of the department. Secondary school students who pass the registration and examination will be introduced to schools for self-study or to participate in wartime service according to their wishes. As for teachers and students of specialized schools and universities, the Education Department will report to the Ministry of Education for approval. Furthermore, the staff of each registration station are assigned by the Education Department as follows: (1) Qujiang: Deng Bingkun, Du Ye; (2) Gaoyao: Li Qingqiao, Zeng Guanguang; (3) Fengshun: Chen Pulin, Yang Qingyao; (4) Huiyang: He Xunqian, Jiang Zongguang; (5) Kaiping Changsha: Mai Kunleng, Zhang Lugen; (6) Suixi: Huo Guangtan, Huang Guoliang; (7) Kowloon: Huang Songya.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Current Status of All Levels of Education at Shanghai Christian Churches <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Number of Middle Schools Nearly Doubled Compared to Before the War</p>
<p>Primary Schools Unable to Relocate to Concessions to Resume Classes The current status of all levels of education at Shanghai Christian Churches, according to recent surveys and statistics from relevant parties, is as follows:</p>
<p>Higher Education: There are thirteen universities run by Christian organizations. The four universities currently in Shanghai are St. John's University, Shanghai University, Soochow University, and Hangzhou Christian College (Hangchow University). (Aurora University is established by the Catholic Church and is not included.) The number of students in 1936 was 2,411; in 1937, 1,637; in 1938, 2,822; and in 1939, 3,333. In the current Shanghai environment, there is a trend for students to go to church universities.</p>
<p>Secondary Education: There are currently forty Christian middle schools in Shanghai, nearly double the number before the war. Among them, twenty-one schools have moved from within the East China region, and nineteen schools were originally in Shanghai. Twenty schools participate in the East China United Middle School Association (thirteen schools participate), the Baptist United Middle School Association (four schools participate), or the Methodist United Middle School Association (four schools participate; this association is now suspended). Twenty schools offer classes independently. The total number of students in junior and senior high school is currently 7,231, of which 1,438 are Christians, accounting for 20%; 942 are catechumens; and 5,130 have chosen religion, accounting for an average of 71%. Last year, there were 615 graduates from senior high school and 756 from junior high school, for a total of 1,371 graduates. There are 586 teachers and staff.</p>
<p>Elementary Education: There are currently twenty-five church elementary schools in Shanghai, with a total of 7,141 students and 362 teachers and staff. Female teachers account for 80%. There are not many church elementary schools in Shanghai, not as developed as middle schools. The reason is that elementary schools have weak financial resources and, having been reduced to war zones, cannot relocate to concessions to resume classes like universities and middle schools can.</p>

<p>Group A Fudan Defeats White Team</p>
<p>Women's Group Weiwei Defeats Women's Youth</p>
<p>The China Youth Volleyball Tournament had five matches the night before. In Group B, Qi Team defeated Zhenzhong, Huoqing defeated Feiteng, and Mingde lost to Xinhuan. In the women's group, Weiwei defeated Women's Youth. Weiwei has a lot of talented players, and their victory was expected. However, the performances of female players Mei Biwei, Xiang Yuqi, and Wang Guangmei were particularly outstanding, earning them a lot of applause. According to Zhang Jiapei of Weiwei, rumors that Weiwei is a reincarnation of Youxing are not true. Weiwei is organized by Wuben, Qian Huayi, and others, who invited Zhang Jiapei and Zhu Shifang of Youxing, and Huang Mingyuan of Gongnuzhong to form the team. It has nothing to do with Youxing. It is hoped that the outside world will not misunderstand. In the Group A match, Fudan played against the White Team. Both sides were evenly matched and put on a wonderful performance. In the end, Fudan won 2-1. Tonight, starting at 6:30 PM, there will be four matches: Yingmei vs. Yinghua Hua in Group A, one women's group match between Huxing and Aiguo, and two matches in Group B.</p>

<p>Wins Over Ouyang Wei and Deng Xiurong</p>
<p>The Jingwu Cup 3rd Annual Shanghai Individual Table Tennis Championship has reached the final stages after eight round-robin matches. Chopper Zhang Ying showed great effort in yesterday's matches. Zhang originally had hopes of winning the championship, but unfortunately, he was defeated by the up-and-coming Chuan Qifang, which affected his prospects. However, Zhang did not lose heart. In yesterday's first match against the veteran Ouyang Wei, Zhang continued to use his chopping style. Ouyang was also good at chopping, but he failed to use his intelligence and instead launched a fierce attack with topspin shots, resulting in a 3-0 defeat. His undefeated record was broken, indirectly giving Lu Hanjun a good opportunity. After Zhang defeated Ouyang, his courage was doubled. In the subsequent match against Deng Xiurong, he put in even more effort. The two were locked in a fierce battle. Deng's topspin shots were faster and more powerful than Ouyang's. After five grueling games, Zhang relied on his final efforts to turn the tables and defeat Deng Xiurong 3-2. With two consecutive victories, there is only one last round of the tournament left. The tournament organizers have scheduled a competition committee meeting at the Jingwu Sports Association at 5:00 PM today to discuss the finals and venue issues. The following committee members are requested to attend on time: Liang Jintang, Xu Duo, Chen Linsheng, Lu Zhongqiu, Yu Binqi, Zhu Lianxiang, Ding Du, and Li Guoxian.

<h3 id="e59">50,000 Chinese Troops Advance, Major Battle to Unfold in Shanghai Suburbs, Ye and Gu Confer on Strategy, Adopt Cooperation, Ammunition Replenished, Morale Exceptionally High <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>According to foreign sources, guerrilla leaders Ye Chen and Gu Fusheng in the suburbs of Shanghai recently decided on a certain strategy, aiming to inflict serious damage on the Japanese through joint efforts. Ye Chen's troops number no less than 50,000. In the middle of last week, they advanced from the north into the Wusong district to support the military authorities' offensive against the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Ye's Troops Arrive, Boosting Morale</p>
<p>According to Chinese sources, Ye Chen and Gu Fusheng met several times in the middle of last month to discuss cooperation methods in terms of strategy and various other aspects. It is currently said that some results have been achieved. The arrival of Ye Chen's troops in the suburbs of Shanghai has greatly boosted the morale of the guerrilla fighters in the suburbs of Shanghai, and has also strengthened their strength.</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Ammunition Transported to Shanghai for Supply</p>
<p>It is also rumored that Ye Chen, in the past few months, intensified the training of his subordinates in a certain area of the Yangtze River, and is equipped with a considerable number of light weapons and rifles. It is also rumored that Ye's troops transported a large amount of ammunition from somewhere to supply the original guerrillas in the suburbs of Shanghai. As for the strategy predetermined by Ye and Gu, the Jiangsu Province area will be divided into two major guerrilla areas: one along the Nanjing-Shanghai Road to its north, and the other along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road line.</p>
<p>Brief Skirmish, Japanese and Puppets Suffer Losses</p>
<p>Chinese reports also confirm that three weeks ago, Gu's troops engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese and puppet troops, inflicting heavy losses on both. After being annihilated, the Japanese army was enraged and burned down civilian houses along the Shanghai-Qingpu Road in the last month, massacring innocent civilians to vent their anger. According to farmers in Jiaxing, Huzhou, and other places, the guerrillas have prepared for replenishment and are quietly waiting for an opportunity to inflict a heavy blow on the Japanese army. Every night, the guerrillas' activities in transporting ammunition and arranging strategic deployments become more active. The guerrillas also advised the villagers to evacuate to other places to avoid being affected by the war. The Japanese and puppet troops in Nanjing were reportedly panicked upon hearing the news, as they learned that the guerrillas were about to launch a major counteroffensive.</p>
<p>Japanese Spokesperson Denies Defeat</p>
<p>The Japanese military spokesman, at yesterday's press conference, denied that the Japanese army suffered a major defeat in southern Henan and northern Hubei, and denied the claim that the Japanese army suffered approximately 59,000 casualties, claiming that "the Chinese army has suffered 130,000 casualties since May 10, and another 1,500 people have been captured by the Japanese army." This is far from the truth, and the attempt to cover up the truth is ridiculous.</p>

<p>A person from Zhejiang Province said that Chairman Huang believes that adjusting the people's food and stabilizing rice prices during the war of resistance is an urgent matter. On the 11th, he convened a grain conference in a certain place, attended by Chairman Huang, Director Ruan, and the commissioners and county magistrates of the 345 administrative regions. They immediately discussed and decided to assess rice prices, stipulating that the price of each load in Jinhua is 13.5 yuan, and ordered nearby counties to extract three-quarters of their stored grain and transport it to Xiaoshao for disaster relief. Currently, the rice price in Xiao is 28 yuan per stone. It is also learned that Jinhua has implemented a rationing system based on population since the 8th, allowing each person to purchase an average of five days' worth of grain per day.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Qian Banks Withdraw from Clearing House, Restore Original Methods, Banks and Money Shops Collect on Behalf, Then Aggregate and Settle Accounts, Silver Association and Money Shop Agree on Collection and Return Time <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The bill clearing house of the Shanghai Banking Joint Reserve Association and the remittance clearing association of the Money Shop Joint Reserve Treasury are each a clearing center for bank and money shop bills. The initial scope of clearing was limited to banks or money shops in the same industry. On July 4 of last year, the Money Shop Joint Reserve Treasury joined the bill clearing house in a entrusted clearing manner, as the 50th spring. All member money shops of the Money Shop Association deposited the payment bills of various banks within the scope of the exchange to the Reserve Treasury, which transferred them to the Reserve Association, which presented them for exchange. All payment bills of various money shops received by various banks within the exchange group were submitted to the Reserve Association for exchange.</p>
<p>Qian Treasury Withdraws and Restores Old Practices</p>
<p>The Money Shop Joint Reserve Treasury wrote to the Banking Joint Reserve Association, stating, "Since our treasury joined the clearing, because it represents the entire money shop industry, with a large number of members and frequent transactions, the procedures are quite inconvenient. Therefore, the Executive Committee of our treasury has decided to voluntarily withdraw from the exchange starting from May 13 and restore the original methods of the past. We hope that your association will grant cooperation to facilitate the process." A reporter from the New Sound Society learned from the Qian Treasury yesterday that the original method of the past, namely the method after June 1935, was that the bill payments between banks and money shops were handled separately by the bank bill clearing house and the money shop remittance clearing association.</p>
<p>Two Industries Agree on Collection and Return Time</p>
<p>The Banking Joint Reserve Association notified its members, stating, "According to the letter from the Qian Shop Reserve Treasury (omitted), it seems that it is not without difficulties for the Qian Treasury to act as an agent for more than 40 money shops to participate in the exchange procedure. This association has agreed to the treasury's request to withdraw from the exchange and intends to restore the original methods of the past starting from May 13. All bank receipts of money shop bills will still be collected by this association, and then aggregated and settled with the Qian Shop Reserve Treasury. It has also been agreed with the treasury that the collection time for banks and money shops in the same industry will be limited to 4:00 PM on the same afternoon, and the return time will be limited to 5:00 PM on the same afternoon."</p>
<p>Collects Foreign Industry Bills on Behalf of Qian Shop</p>
<p>The association's collection time for foreign industry bills of the Qian Shop is re-stipulated as follows: (1) Exchange banks must deposit the due Qian Shop and foreign industry bills received on the same day into the association within the following time: A. Member Qian Shop bills: before 3:00 PM on the same afternoon; banks can directly collect from the shops between 3:00 PM and 4:00 PM. B. Bills from banks, silver companies, trust companies, and bills other than those of the exchange bank: before 2:00 PM on the same afternoon. C. Other foreign industry bills: before 12:00 PM on the same morning. D. Foreign merchant bank bills: before 11:00 AM on the same morning. E. Other foreign merchant foreign industry bills: before 10:00 AM on the same morning. (2) Exchange banks must deposit various foreign industry bills that are not due before 4:00 PM on the day before the due date.</p>
<p>Exchange Time of Silver Clearing House</p>
<p>The exchange time of the bank bill clearing house, in accordance with the association's regulations, is the first time from 11:00 AM to 11:30 AM every day, and the second time from 3:20 PM to 3:50 PM. On Saturdays, the first time is from 12:30 PM to 1:00 PM, and the first time is from 3:20 PM to 3:50 PM. Starting from May 13, it will be changed to (A) exchange time starting from 3:30 PM every afternoon; (B) entrusted deposit time for bills exchanged by the association: before 2:45 PM every afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Police Form Plainclothes Team to Search for Bandits in the Concession, Patrols in Various Streets and Markets Starting Yesterday, Strictly Prevent Kidnapping Bandits and Robbers <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The Central Police Station of the Public Concession, starting yesterday morning, dispatched two special plainclothes teams to patrol the streets and markets, strictly searching pedestrians and passing vehicles. The special plainclothes search team is composed of the most experienced detectives, who regularly perform their duties to prevent armed robberies and kidnapping thugs from operating in the concession. Previously, the police sent out uniformed search teams to perform the same duties, but it is now known that in recent major criminal cases in the concession, bandits often designed to skillfully avoid them, so the police devised other countermeasures.</p>
<p>Gamblers Become Desperate</p>
<p>The recent surge in crime in the concession, the public believes that the bandits' dens and their launch points are located in several gambling dens in "bad soil" in western Shanghai. This has been confirmed by Wu Guichen, the injured bandit captured in the case of the robbery of 175,000 yuan of customs duties on the evening of the 10th. According to Wu, he was a ball boy at the Guangxi Club at No. 135 Jessfield Road. Due to heavy gambling losses, he invited his accomplices to break into the concession and carry out the robbery.</p>
<p>Affected Residents Dare Not Report to the Police</p>
<p>The bodyguards of the gambling dens in western Shanghai often rob residents and pedestrians in "bad soil," and there are many victims who, although they have suffered losses, dare not report to the police for fear that the bandits will retaliate against them or their families. Those who carry money through "bad soil" are particularly apprehensive. Recently, someone hid money in his leather shoes, but since leather shoes are currently very expensive, they were coveted by bandits, who robbed the shoes and took the hidden money along with them.</p>
<p>Fake Police Insufficient to Maintain Public Order</p>
<p>The police affairs problem in the "bad soil" of western Shanghai is still complex and has not been clarified. Since the Shanghai Municipal Council and the puppet city government signed the Shanghai West Outer Roads Police Agreement in February of this year, they began a meeting to establish a joint "Special Police Force" to exercise authority in the outer roads area of western Shanghai. After three months of negotiations, no success has been achieved. However, according to well-informed sources, the "Special Police Force" may be established at the beginning of next month.</p>

<p>The Old, Weak, and Disabled will be Resettled Separately</p>
<p>The Refugee Relief Association Issued a Notice Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has resolved that all refugees in the various charities and shelters under its jurisdiction, except for the old, weak, disabled, orphans, and widows, must leave the shelters before the 31st of this month and will not be extended. The association issued a notice yesterday afternoon, notifying the refugees in the shelters. According to statistics from the China Child Welfare Association, there are 21,800 refugee children in the city, of which the association accommodates 660. Living expenses have risen from 7.5 yuan per person per month to 11.5 yuan, but since they are all orphans, it is difficult to disperse them. It has been decided to launch a large-scale fundraising campaign starting next month to remedy the situation and to accelerate the introduction of refugee children to work outside to reduce the burden on their ancestors. The tailors, barbers, and laundry departments of the association train refugee children, and their services are very welcome if needed by all sectors.</p>

<p>Establishing a "Gauze Exchange"</p>
<p>Most of the Internal Staff are Japanese</p>
<p>Recently, the Japanese, under the guise of Chinese merchants, established a "Gauze Exchange" at No. 69 Jiujiang Road in this city. Its capital is nominally 1 million Japanese yen, divided into 20,000 shares, each share being 50 Japanese yen, but the actual paid-up capital is only 250,000 Japanese yen. The scope of its transactions is divided into three parts: cotton yarn, cotton, and cotton cloth, and it also operates warehousing services. There are 120 brokers in the exchange, with 40 in each part. The guarantee money for each broker is 20,000 Japanese yen. The staff of the exchange, in addition to a few who are ignorant and willing to work for them, are all Japanese, including the brokers. Formal Chinese merchants have all refused to participate, because the establishment of an exchange must be approved by the central government, and foreign shareholders are absolutely not allowed. The current organization is obviously established by the Japanese under a false name, intending to disrupt the gauze market.</p>

<p>Discovery of Ore Veins at Zijin Mountain</p>
<p>"Asia Development Board" and Others Eager to Try</p>
<p>The Japanese side, in the occupied areas, attempts to control all resources, establishing various companies and concocting various plans. However, due to the difficult war situation, their financial resources are depleted, and nothing can be achieved. According to Japanese propaganda, a certain Sonobe Kyodo (園部共人) discovered gold ore veins at the peak of Zijin Mountain in Jiangning. The "Asia Development Board" then requested the newly organized "Central China Mining Company" to conduct investigations, inquiring about the extent of gold deposits there and studying the discovered ore veins. Our reporter specifically consulted mining experts, who stated that the Yangtze River Delta region is an alluvial plain with extremely poor mineral resources. Even if there are deposits, their quality and quantity would be low and negligible, with no value for development. The Japanese side's extensive propaganda regarding the Zijin Mountain gold mine only reveals their desperate fantasies and unrealistic gold rush dreams.</p>

<p>U.S. Consul General to Shanghai, Lockwood, and U.S. Consul General to Tianjin, Gaulter Hurt, are scheduled to depart Shanghai for America tomorrow morning at 1:00 AM aboard the President Coolidge. This trip is a leave of absence for both to return home. However, according to reliable sources, they will also provide some important military reports to Washington. Consul General Gaulter Hurt of Tianjin arrived in Shanghai last week aboard the transport ship USS Henderson from Qinhuangdao. He stated that although Japan has begun to reconsider the United States' position in the Far East, the pressure and blockade on the Tianjin Concession have not improved.

<h3 id="e69">Shanghai Municipal Council Road Workers Receive Wage Increase <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Workers Still Show No Sign of Returning to Work</p>
<p>Garbage Truck Workers Follow Suit with Work Slowdown</p>
<p>The road maintenance workers, street sweepers, and garbage cart pushers belonging to the Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council in the International Settlement have been slowing down work since last Tuesday. As of yesterday, a satisfactory solution had not yet been reached. The Council notified all workers at noon yesterday that their wages would be increased by one and a half dimes per day based on their original wages.</p>
<p>They also urged all workers to resume work immediately to avoid hindering the city's sanitation and road administration. However, as of last night, the workers still showed no sign of returning to work, and the piles of garbage next to the garbage bins in various neighborhoods were even larger than yesterday. The paper scraps, fruit peels, and debris on various roads were scattered all over the ground. Some roadsides even had accumulated stagnant water from residents, which could not be cleaned up. Similar slowdowns occurred once more than ten years ago in the French Concession and were resolved, but this is the first time</p>
<p>in the International Settlement.</p>
<p>Garbage truck workers in the western district of the International Settlement also went on strike the day before yesterday morning due to their inability to make ends meet and their demand for improved treatment. Garbage truck workers in the central district followed suit yesterday morning, going on strike across the board, causing great inconvenience to residents without sanitary facilities.</p>
<p>According to representatives of the garbage truck workers, the decision to strike was out of necessity due to skyrocketing prices and the pressure of living expenses. The workers' daily wages were only six or seven dimes, and they had repeatedly requested a 20% wage increase from the employers, but their requests were not accepted. Therefore, they had no choice but to resort to striking, but they hoped for a satisfactory resolution.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Japan Issues Another Warning Regarding Shanghai-Wenzhou Shipping Lines <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Claims If Ships Sail to Wenzhou Again</p>
<p>They Will Open Fire</p>
<p>Since Japan used the excuse of military action in Wenzhou to prohibit foreign ships from sailing there, foreign ships sailing to Wenzhou have often been obstructed by Japanese warships outside the port. According to sources in the shipping industry, the Japanese side has noticed that foreign ships sailing from Shanghai to Wenzhou have become increasingly frequent. Although they have repeatedly obstructed them, the ships continue to travel back and forth quite frequently. Therefore, they recently issued a warning to foreign ships operating on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line, stating that if any ships sail to Wenzhou in the future, Japanese warships will open fire. It is said that the shipping companies will ask the authorities of various consulates to lodge protests with the Japanese side to protect their shipping rights. It is also learned that last Friday, four ships operating on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line, including the German ship Haifupfei Kang (海福飛康) and the Italian ship Baoli (寳利), were simultaneously detained by Japanese warships outside the port of Wenzhou when returning to Shanghai from Wenzhou. They were released after the shipowners jointly lodged protests. The ships are expected to return to Shanghai today or tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Runs on Four Banks Including Dutch, and Belgian Gradually Subsiding; Deposits of Germans Still Paid as Usual, Chinese Withdraw and Deposit in Chinese Banks <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Since the German invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium and the expansion of the European war, the Shanghai branches of four banks, including the Dutch banks Netherlands, Anta, and Belgian Hua Bi (華比), and the Italian bank Hua Yi (華義), have experienced a run on deposits. After the four banks prepared cash to meet the withdrawals, the run on deposits has gradually subsided since yesterday. Most of the German deposits in the Dutch and Belgian banks have been withdrawn. However, as the banks have not received government orders, they are still paying out German deposits as usual. It is reported that Chinese people have withdrawn their deposits from the four banks and deposited them in various commercial banks. The total amount of withdrawals from the four banks cannot be ascertained at this time, but it is likely to be substantial. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency obtained the following information about the operations of the Shanghai branches of the four banks yesterday: (1) The Dutch Bank has a capital of 80,030,000 NF and engages in deposits, securities, loans, remittances, and other banking businesses. (2) Anta Bank has a capital of 100,000,000 and engages in deposits, loans, remittances, and various investments. (3) Hua Bi Bank has a capital of 200,000,000 FR and engages in all banking businesses and remittances and has issued banknotes. (4) Hua Yi Bank has a capital of 1,000,000 US and engages in remittances, advances against documents, deposits, investments, safekeeping, and guarantees for the purchase and sale of promissory notes, acceptance of drafts, and collection of bills.</p>

<p>After the Netherlands was affected by the European war, various industries were significantly impacted, and Dutch shipping was temporarily suspended as a result. Previous reports have documented these circumstances. The resumption measures will follow the example of Norwegian ships, and the routes must also be designated by the British Navy. Currently, British and Dutch authorities are in discussions. Once an agreement is reached, Dutch shipping can resume. The Chisha Danny ship, which has been staying in Hong Kong, the China Canada ship, which has been berthed in Luzon, and the new passenger ship Chazha Lianjia (芝楂連加) are all still awaiting orders. The Royal Company's Stagen ship, loaded with 4,075 tons of coal from Haiphong, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 12th) and berthed at buoys 22 and 33 for unloading. It was originally scheduled to depart Shanghai on the 16th, but it is now reported that the lifting of the anchor has been temporarily suspended, awaiting government orders before determining the next course of action. In general, the resumption of Dutch shipping is not far off and is expected to be resolved within this week, perhaps.</p>

<p>Deng Yang, a woman from Yixing, 35 years old, residing at No. 18 Hubei Road, has recently hired lawyer Lu Jiayi to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court, accusing Ye Gu, landlady of the Beijing Apartments at No. 439 Poplar Road (also known as Yi Gu), and her father, Gu Peifu, of the crime of enticing a girl under the age of 20 to leave her family, according to Article 241 of the Criminal Code. The court accepted the case, and Judge Sun Pengxian of Criminal Division No. 2 summoned the two defendants for trial yesterday afternoon. Neither defendant appeared, only the plaintiff and her lawyer appeared in court. According to the plaintiff, her daughter, Landi, disappeared eight years ago, at the age of nine. It was not until recently that she learned from Zhang Xiaomei, a fellow villager residing at No. 6 Xiamen Road, that Landi had been enticed by the two defendants. Therefore, at 5:00 PM on the 14th of last month, she reported the case to the Songshan Road Xixiafei Police Station, which sent detectives to the Beijing Apartments where the defendants resided and found a document regarding Landi's value as collateral. However, the two defendants were released by the police station without prosecution. The plaintiff was unwilling to accept this outcome and filed a lawsuit, requesting the court to punish the defendants according to the law and to order them to return Landi so that the family can be reunited. The court, noting that the two defendants had not appeared, adjourned the hearing to the 17th.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Bird's-Eye View of Speculative Activities in Shanghai <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Market has always been a gathering place for speculators. During the cheap silver of 1931 and the expensive silver of 1935, these speculators invariably fueled the flames, creating alarming waves. Since the retreat of the National Army and the instability of the exchange rate, these people have taken the opportunity to wreak havoc. The shrinkage of the exchange rate and the rise in prices are almost entirely caused by these individuals. Economic authorities have learned the broad details of this situation, understanding that suppressing speculation and hoarding is the key to stabilizing prices at present.</p>
<p>Emergence of Black Market</p>
<p>Since the emergence of a black market for foreign exchange, Japanese banks and speculators (including those who store foreign currency, hoard gold, and implement capital flight) have been the two major threats to the foreign exchange market. Even if imports exceed exports, remittances from overseas Chinese can offset the difference. These speculators, believing that currency will not be stable during wartime, disregard national interests, implement capital flight, and closely follow the Japanese puppet regime to seize foreign exchange. By August of last year, the British exchange rate had shrunk to 3.75 pence, and the US exchange rate to 7.25 yuan.</p>
<p>Impact of European War</p>
<p>In September, the outbreak of the European war caused great panic among those holding foreign currency. They generally believed that foreign currency was unstable and speculated that prices would rise. Therefore, they exchanged foreign currency for goods, causing the foreign exchange rate to rise while prices increased dramatically, contrary to the principles of prices and exchange rates. At the end of last year, prices had increased significantly compared to one month before the start of the European war. The index was 208 before the European war (August 1939) and 293 at the end of the year.</p>
<p>World Prices</p>
<p>However, the trend of world prices is not the same. Prices in the United States have not increased significantly, and even in Britain, which is at war, prices had only increased by 20% from the start of the war by the end of last year (the index was 86 in August last year and 106 in December). Japan has also only increased by 22% (the index was 227 in August last year and 249 in December).</p>
<p>Strict Suppression Is Necessary</p>
<p>If it is said that the prices in this city are affected by high transportation costs, this would not be the main reason. The main reason is that speculators, seeing the high prices of goods during the last war, have hoarded goods, stimulating a sharp rise in prices. Therefore, suppressing speculation, although a temporary measure, can still be effective for a time, slowing down the rise in prices. The fluctuations in the city's prices and foreign exchange market are all caused by these individuals.</p>

<p>Fang Fucheng, a Chinese detective of the Hongkou Police Station, and detectives Chen Dabao and Wang Changru learned on the afternoon of the day before yesterday at 8:30 PM that a large number of bandits were hiding in Room 9 of the Xialu Hotel at No. 98 Xialu Road, plotting to rob residents of their property. They reported to the head detective and coordinated with Western detectives, all armed with weapons, and quietly rushed to Room 9 of the hotel to make arrests. The bandit leader Jiang Jinshu from Jiangbei attempted to resist with a gun but was captured before he could act. His accomplices, Dai Chaoren, Yao Guotai, Wu Qifu, and Xi Xiaoerzi, all from Jiangbei, were also captured, totaling five people. One handgun and five bullets were confiscated. They were taken to the police station and sent to the Criminal Division No. 3 of the Special Court the next morning. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian explained the case and requested their detention for investigation of the defendants' crimes. The court ordered them to be remanded in custody for further review.</p>

<p>Liu Yongshou (35 years old) and Liu Yongtou (30 years old), brothers from Yangzhou, were both working as waiters in the Zhenhua Inn at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Guangxi Road. They were lodging on the third floor of the Zhang Shunxing clock shop at No. 165, on the corner of Kaizi Road and Wermeng Road. Recently, due to a change in their night shift work, they were sleeping in their residence during the day. At around 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, while the Liu brothers were sleeping soundly in their residence, Hu Shanxiang's room on the second floor suddenly caught fire due to carelessness. In an instant, the fire spread uncontrollably. All the other tenants who lived there learned of the fire and fled. However, the Liu brothers were awakened from their sleep but were unable to escape, resulting in their death in the fire. The fire brigade was dispatched to put out the fire, and it took an hour to extinguish. A total of one building at No. 165 was destroyed, and neighboring houses were also affected. Firefighters found the bodies of the Liu brothers in the rubble. They were burned beyond recognition and were sent to the Tongren Auxiliary Yuan branch for examination. It will be reported to the court today to send Chang Jian for examination. The police station has sent detectives to interrogate the fire starter, Hu Shanxiang, to investigate the cause of the fire for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Theft Cases Abound Under the Shadow of High Prices <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Strange Thief Caught in Xingye Building Yesterday</p>
<p>Steals Toilet Float and Hides It in Pants</p>
<p>Under the shadow of high prices, theft cases are emerging endlessly in Shanghai. If residents in various neighborhoods are not careful, their daily utensils are stolen. The theft of bicycle parts from companies and shops is also frequently heard. Now, this kind of theft skill is being applied to the toilets of major buildings. Yesterday, a strange thief who stole the toilet float from the toilet in the Xingye Building on Beijing Road was caught. The thief was wearing a long Pulis shirt and leather shoes and looked quite decent. When he was discovered, he had already put the removed float in his pants. It was not the first time that the toilet floats on each floor of the building had been stolen. The thief was sent to the police station together for investigation. It was later heard that similar incidents had occurred in many other major buildings, and because they are public toilets, it is felt that prevention is difficult.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Taichangxiang Shipping Company Sues Tongsheng Company for Compensation; Court Hearing in May Concluded Debate Yesterday Morning <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Han Jinhua, the legal representative of the Taichangxiang Shipping Company at No. 6 Jiqing Lane, Sanyangjing Bridge, hired lawyers Jiang Yiping and Ge Bangren to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Special No. 2 Court against Zeng Bingsen, manager of the Tongsheng Company, and partners Zeng Yiping, Huang Ruhai, Wei Wenlin, Chen Shaoji, Yao Rongyuan, Zeng Nianci, Liu Nianhua, Zeng Jizhi Chen Wenzeng, Liu Zirong, and the intermediary Yao Shumin, a total of twelve people, to</p>
<p>sue for damages. The complaint stated that the Tongsheng Company, formed by the first through eleventh defendants, leased the Norwegian merchant ship "Landi" through the intermediary of Yao Shumin, with a fixed monthly rent of 887 pounds and 10 shillings, for a term of twelve months from the date of delivery. The lease agreement was signed on March 17 of last year, and the ship was delivered on April 11 of the same year at 6:00 AM. However, not long after, in June of the same year, the company sent several letters claiming that their capital had been completely depleted,</p>
<p>requesting to terminate the lease and refusing to pay the rent. The plaintiff believed that this was a breach of contract and sent a letter to negotiate. The company refused to comply with a reasonable settlement and declared bankruptcy. All managers and responsible personnel disappeared. The plaintiff had no choice but to ask someone to repeatedly plead with the Norwegian shipowner, who finally agreed to a settlement, with the plaintiff paying the shipowner 1,250 pounds sterling in damages and 5,000 yuan in commission. After investigation, the above-mentioned damages and expenses incurred due to the breach of contract, together with the plaintiff's ten months of profit,</p>
<p>totaled 943 pounds, 12 shillings, and 6 pence sterling, and 75,365 yuan and 1 cent Chinese currency. The company's partners, i.e., the first through eleventh defendants, should be held jointly and severally liable for compensation. Furthermore, the twelfth defendant, Yao Shumin, as the intermediary for the contract, received a large commission of over one thousand yuan per month, but provided false reports, causing significant damage to the plaintiff and should also be held liable. The plaintiff requested the court to order the defendants to jointly and severally compensate the plaintiff 943 pounds, 12 shillings, and 6 pence sterling, and</p>
<p>75,365 yuan and 1 cent Chinese currency, as well as statutory interest at a weekly rate of 5% from the date of filing the lawsuit until the date of execution, and to bear the costs of the lawsuit. The court accepted the case and Judge Chen Can of Civil Division No. 7 presided over the hearing. Except for Chen Wenzeng and Liu Zirong, whose whereabouts were unknown and served by public notice, the other defendants hired lawyers Ma Shouhua, Zhang Danping, Su Fuchou, and Zhang Guangzong to defend them. The court found the case complex and ordered further investigation and hearings. It has been five months since then. The hearing was resumed yesterday morning with defendants Yao Rongyuan and Yao Shumin present. After the court questioned witnesses Huang Yufu and Gu Zongrui in detail, it ordered the commencement of the debate and announced that a judgment would be made at a scheduled time.</p>

<p>A kidnapping case occurred on Daxi Road near Hong'en Hospital in western Shanghai at around 4:45 PM yesterday. The victim was a student named Li Zhaolin, 13 years old, from Ningbo, who attended a school on Daxi Road. At around 4:45 PM yesterday, Li was returning home from school and was walking near Hong'en Hospital when four or five kidnappers suddenly emerged in a chartered car, lying in ambush there. Upon seeing Li, they immediately jumped out, forcibly dragged him into the car, and threatened the chartered driver to drive the car westward at high speed. The driver, intimidated, had no choice but to comply. It was not until they reached the area near the boundary line of Dunxin Road that they ordered him to stop. They all jumped out and, with the driver as a witness, took Li out of bounds and into a low house. The driver, having encountered this unexpected event, quickly reported the incident to the police station in charge after regaining his freedom. The police station took a detailed account of the incident and investigated the families of the kidnappers in order to track down the bandits. It was later learned that the child lived at No. 2, Lane 767, Haige Road, and the car used by the kidnappers belonged to the Silver Car Company, with license plate number 10258.</p>

<p>Recently, disputes over rent increases and evictions have occurred in buildings such as the Wupin Building, the Xinda Building, and the Xiangda Building. It is expected that after the implementation of increased taxes starting in July this year, rent increase disputes will become even more frequent.

<h3 id="e89">One of the Early Summer Scenes (Part 1): Tracing the Origins of the Soda Fountain <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the day after Whitmonday, seven weeks after Easter (commonly known as the foreign Qingming Festival). In the beginning of this so-called Whitsuntide - "Pentecost Week," the early summer scenery of Shanghai is also actively unfolding before our eyes.</p>
<p>Originally, with cherry red cherries and cloudy white fermented glutinous rice, everyone has undoubtedly stepped into the door of summer. Released from the heavy clothes of midwinter, the colors on everyone's body become more and more obvious, and the materials look thinner and thinner; the things in their stomachs are also gradually moving from rich and greasy flavors to a light and smooth path. If this door of summer is a real entity, then it must be very narrow and constricted, just like the gate of heaven that the rich must pass through.</p>
<p>"Coca-Cola"... Ice cream... Orange juice... Soda... This great cold drink encirclement has unknowingly made the entire Shanghai its object of encirclement. From now on, how this encirclement exerts its power is only a competition between time and space.</p>
<p>In the commemorative album of Shanghai's most famous candy and biscuit company, there is the following passage: "Appetizing breakfast, morning coffee, lunch for busy people, tea talks with friends, cold drinks after entertainment, quiet dinner, and all-day ice room service..." Isn't the status of cold drinks in a certain class in Shanghai clearly telling us?</p>
<p>The place that sells cold drinks is commonly called an ice room in Shanghai, but it is actually derived from the American Soda Fountain—soda fountain. The founder of this business was a Frenchman who fled to the United States, named Durand—E. Durand. He started opening ice rooms in Philadelphia in April 1825. That was 115 years away from now—the fifth year of Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty, even before Liang Qichao was born!</p>
<p>When we run into a high-end cold drink shop, we can see the characteristics of the so-called "soda fountain". Usually it is a long counter, inlaid with marble or tiles on the outside. In addition to the ice cream buckets and sand filter water tanks hidden inside, there is a row of faucet conduits on the counter, which can be pressed or turned by hand at any time to dispense the foamy beverages stored in the square or round boxes. The liquid poured out from the row of faucets makes a hissing sound, and at the same time, a foam floats on the rim of the cup. This hissing sound and the ephemeral foam are the effects produced by the "authentic" soda fountain.</p>
<p>The background behind a sophisticated soda fountain counter is often a large crystal clear mirror. On the peach wood shelves on the left and right are many brightly colored juice bottles, various canned fruits, and specially made beverage mixers: like the "Coca-Cola" refrigerator, as red as a girl's lips, with two C's on it, lively like a snake. The Horlicks milk powder mixer stands tall and has an elegant look; a stack of high, sterilized paper cups in the glass tube is like a group of gentlemen's hats. In addition, it is decorated with various color-coordinated advertising paintings, exquisite and soft reflective lights, etc., and a lively atmosphere hits the hearts of every enthusiastic customer.

<h3 id="e90">Finance: Selling Pressure on Foreign Exchange Grows <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listing caused the US exchange rate to loosen by 0.0625 due to the exchange rate rising by 0.13. The situation on the inner board of the British exchange rate remained unchanged, with no special changes. Due to the exchange rate reporting an increase, an image of British tightness and American hardness was seen after the opening. In addition, due to the ceaseless dumping by Chinese speculative merchants and others, and the Bank of Japan also once sold, the potential was stable but loose. The market was even more silent afterwards, but the market situation recovered and lengthened again compared to the afternoon's closing. As a result, British gold was at 3.5, the US exchange rate was 4.8125, British tight at 0.0625, American hard at 0.09375, and the spot and futures became more and more squeezed. Trading in June was rarely heard.</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan Also Sold</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the exchange rate between Britain and the United States, Shanghai, France, and other currencies was flat. The US dollar was 0.13 longer against the British pound, unchanged against Shanghai, and up 0.055 against the French franc. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning spot selling price was British gold 3.46875, and the US exchange rate was 4.75, compared to last Saturday's closing, British tight at 0.09375, and the US dollar hard at 0.03125, which was due to the rebound in the exchange rate. The trend was uncertain after the opening. Afterwards, Chinese speculative merchants first sold, selling to foreign firms the May</p>
<p>US dollar at 4.65625 to 4.6875. The HSBC listing was announced, British flat and American lengthened by 0.0625. The balance tax on silver was announced with no increase or decrease. After that, the Bank of Japan dumped heavily, and Chinese speculative merchants continued to sell the May US dollar. Foreign firms absorbed the Bank of Japan's 4.75, and British gold speculative merchants sold to foreign firms at 3.46875. Therefore, the market was already quite loose and hard. Spot British gold was the cheapest at 3.53125, and the US dollar reached 4.84375. Until noon, Chinese speculative merchants stopped selling and the opportunity changed, and the price stabilized. The closing price was British gold 3.5, and the US dollar was 4.78125. May British gold was 3.746875, and the US dollar was 4.7187. As a result, compared to the morning opening, spot British and American were both hard by 0.03125.</p>
<p>The Market Situation Was Silent in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The situation was still loose in the afternoon, due to the strong selling intentions of Chinese speculators. Initially, foreign firms had a healthy appetite, so the May US dollar opened at 4.75. Afterwards, transactions turned sparse, and the price no longer changed. The closing price was British gold 3.5, and the US dollar was 4.8125. May British gold was 3.4875, and the US dollar was 4.75. Compared to last Saturday's spot market, British gold was tight at 0.0625, and the US dollar was hard at 0.09375. May British gold was soft at 0.03125, and the US dollar was squeezed by 0.0125.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Foreign Currencies Weak <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation, British and American gold pounds fell by two yuan each due to frequent gold price declines, so the supply was very smooth. British gold notes first rose and then fell, and as a result, fell by 0.5. American gold notes showed a clear downward trend, retreating to 20.09 in the morning, and then retreating to 20.05, finally ending at 20.06, a drop of 0.5 compared to last Saturday. Hong Kong notes were slightly available in the morning, and the market price was slightly soft. There was demand in the afternoon, and the market price returned to flat. In addition, foreign currency such as French franc notes had no honor or disgrace. The supply of Japanese gold notes suddenly increased, and the market price fell. The evening market retreated to 1.255. The trend of Korean notes was also soft, and the evening market retreated to 0.975.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Exchange Rates, Discount Rates Stable <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange rate and discount rate remained stable, fluctuating around 130 yuan per thousand yuan in the beginning. It rose from 125 yuan to 135 yuan, and then fell slightly in the afternoon to 130 yuan, the same as last Saturday's price. The Shanghai Money Dealers Association's interbank interest rate remained unchanged, and was quoted at 0.25 in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<p>Exchange Rate Lengthens, Gold Price Falls Again</p>
<p>Fluctuating Around the 6,900 Yuan Mark All Day</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot red market situation was flat and tired, hovering around the 6,900 yuan mark all day. Originally, the exchange market was stable with a slight loosening trend, people were timid, transactions were scattered, and the price was difficult to rise. The morning opened at 6,910 yuan, a sharp drop of 60 yuan compared to the end of last week. Moreover, because there were few buyers in the market, and securities firms helped to sell, it had fallen to 6,870 yuan. Later, a certain securities firm suddenly absorbed slightly at a low price, raising it by 40 to 50 yuan. However, the exchange market still reported loosening and hardening, and those who wanted to enter were hesitant, while those who wanted to sell increased, and it fell again to a low of 6,850 yuan. Near noon, news suddenly came that Italy in Europe had joined the war. At that time, foreign exchange stopped loosening and started to rise, once surging to 6,940 yuan, but soon it was heard that the previous rumor was false, so it returned to a declining trend at noon. In the afternoon, it revolved around 6,900 yuan, with narrow ups and downs, finally ending at 6,895 yuan, a continuation of a small 75 yuan. The total daily transaction was about 3,000 taels. Ornament gold also fell by 10 yuan to 700 yuan. Customs gold, etc., were all flat.</p>
<p>Spot Red at 75 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the morning, the exchange rate for each bar (ten taels) reported a long trend, and the US exchange rate hardened, so people's hearts were not encouraged, and the two gold shops competed to sell first, and the price went downstream. A certain gold shop sold ten taels to a securities firm, only for 6,910 yuan, which was 60 yuan less than the end of last week. After the opening, the selling trend became more and more intense, and there was a lack of buyers. A certain bank sold ten taels each to silver shops and gold shops, only for 6,870 yuan. Later, because securities firms and gold shops saw low prices and searched for purchases, the sellers turned out to be at a loss. In a moment, it rose back by 55 yuan. The bank entered 20 taels of gold into the gold shop, for 6,925 yuan. After that, because the foreign exchange still reported loosening, people's hearts were difficult to lift, buyers turned less, and in addition to the bank and securities firms, etc., dumping heavily, it went up again. The bank paid ten taels to the exchange industry, losing at 6,850 yuan. At that time, limit price buyers appeared, and the falling trend was immediately stopped. Before long, the foreign exchange suddenly turned soft, stirring people's hearts. The bank turned from selling to buying, and the gold shop grabbed in again. At the same time, retail investors saw the situation and grabbed in a lot. For a time, the market on the counter was full of vitality, leaping by 90 yuan. The silver shop sold ten taels to retail investors, for 6,940 yuan. At noon, there were gradually fewer entrants, and the selling became more intense. Gold shops and retail investors successively sold, and there was a lack of support during the return wind, and it retreated again into the 6,900 yuan mark. The bank paid ten taels to the exchange industry, for 6,880 yuan, as the closing price for noon. In the afternoon, the market situation was calm. At the opening of the market, the gold shop raised the price to buy, raising it by 20 yuan, entering ten taels from retail investors, for 6,900 yuan. However, the bank sold ten taels to a securities firm, for 6,890 yuan. Soon the securities firm's eating appetite suddenly became strong, so it raised it by 25 yuan in sparse transactions. The gold shops mutually traded 20 taels, for 6,915 yuan. Unexpectedly, the shop suddenly stopped buying and started selling. Before long, it fell by 35 yuan. The bank sold ten taels to the gold shop, for 6,880 yuan. Afterwards, another bank helped to search for purchases, slightly raising it by 15 yuan. The banks mutually traded ten taels, for 6,895 yuan, as the closing price for the evening. As a result, this weekend ended with a small 75 yuan discount. It has been verified that it has been falling for two consecutive days, for a total drop of 195 yuan. The whole day was a 90 yuan rise and fall. The selling price of cash gold shops is 10 yuan higher according to the spot red, and the purchase is reduced by 20 yuan. The current bid gold is more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and very little trading is done.</p>
<p>Ornament Gold Changed to 700 Yuan</p>
<p>At the beginning, the large Tonghang still suspended 711 yuan for each tael of silver shop ornament gold for exchange. At 9:35, it was suspended for a small 10 yuan. There were no changes after that. It is estimated that the large firms changed the suspension to 700 yuan. The new Tonghang has the same price as the above. The purchase is reduced by about 20 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Grains: Foreign Rice Rises by 1-2 Yuan, Domestically Grown Rice Also Rises Sharply <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Since the foreign rice market rebounded once the week before, yesterday it still showed a tight color at the opening. However, those who had goods, because of the European war situation, deeply worried that the future of foreign rice would be affected, regarded it as a rare commodity, and were unwilling to sell it lightly. The merchant groups conspired to enter the market, and speculators further made waves, pushing the price of rice higher and higher. For example, No. 1 Saigon was 53 yuan, Huojiao was 52 yuan, and Xiaojiao was 50.7 yuan, which was a rise of 1 to 2 yuan compared to the closing price of the first half of the week. Afterwards, those who profited returned to the market one after another, and the market softened by 0.5 yuan. The guest gangs returned to search for purchases, and then rose again. As a result, No. 1 Saigon still closed at 53 yuan, and Xiaojiao at 50.7 yuan.</p>
<p>It was also reported that foreign rice orders continued to arrive at the port. In the future, the orders will not be divided, which has caused the absorption of the accumulated purchases of real strength. In addition, because the actual code of the goods thrown out in the first phase of May was insufficient, the shorts were anxious to make up for it, and more prices were released. Therefore, the original settlement price of Saigon in the first phase of May opened at 62 yuan, and the market was from 62.56 to 62.8. No. 2 Siam which had arrived opened at 61 yuan and 61.5 yuan, and Xiaojiao opened at 60.08 to 61 yuan, which was more than the large yuan compared to the end of last week.</p>
<p>After the domestic glutinous rice market turned prosperous, yesterday there were continued purchases from large households and general practical sales channels, so the prices of each transaction continued to increase by about one yuan. It is estimated that Jinli special yuan was sold for 45.5 yuan, 44 yuan, and Chang Danbai yuan for 42.3 yuan.</p>
<p>The arrival of domestic rice such as thick and thin indica rice has been very rare recently, intermittent, not as prosperous as it was a month ago. It is rumored that outside the market, the owners of the goods are all defending, and the guests are sincerely afraid of missing the opportunity, and they are very eager to pay attention, resulting in a high price increase of one yuan. Wuxi special Qing indica rice is 52.3 yuan, Fenjing is 51 yuan, Kun Changjing is 51.2 yuan, Sujue is 50 yuan, Qing Si special thin is 51 yuan, market is 50 yuan, and Nanhang early rice Zhongguan is 49 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Flour Guest Disk Rises, Japanese Factories Buy Wheat, Coarse Grains Continuously Transported North <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The flour market is firm. The No. 2 flour factory's disk is firmly stationed at the original price of 14 yuan, and the guest disk has been raised. This is because the north-south ocean gang's sales have gradually become active, and they have to absorb at high prices because they need to be extravagant. The price of each factory's wholesale price on this street is originally maintained, so the guest disk has been raised by more than one yuan compared to the local disk. However, the old brand of returned goods should only be traded locally, and the price is opened at 14.05 yuan. The Japanese factory's flour price is 14 yuan. There are 5,000 bags of each flour transaction. The market situation is more stable because the price of rice is rising and people's hearts are more stable.</p>
<p>The wheat market transaction between Chinese factories and export gangs is stagnant. The merchants have few stocks and little arrival. Few samples are seen in the market. Yesterday, the Chinese factories' intake was still stagnant, but it was heard that the Japanese factories had slightly taken in, and the price was 22 yuan. There were 300-400 bags traded.</p>
<p>Coarse grains are continuously transported to North China. Today, Taikoo Company's Hubei ship exports 3,000 bags of foreign corn to Weihaiwei, 1,200 bags to Yantai, and 6,500 bags of flour to Yantai and 7,000 bags to Tianjin.</p>

<p>Yarn market: Frustrated, falls, rises slightly. This is because foreign exchange is static and lengthened, making it impossible for speculators to operate. At the same time, there is no wholesale development of actual transactions, and the price has reached a high level. Those who do more are also uneasy. The price of Shuangma in June is still outside 1,700 yuan. This price makes buyers at a loss.</p>
<p>At the opening of the current yarn morning, people's energy is mediocre, and overseas British and American exchange rates are lengthened, and the US exchange rate is slightly soft. There are few buyers in the market and they lack strength. The spot price of 20 Shuangma is 1,630 yuan, rising to 35 yuan. It is heard that the guest sales are not prosperous and the gold has fallen back, and the selling trend is slightly strong, falling to 1,610 yuan. The half-day transaction statistics are 1,490 yuan. The quotation for 20 Shuangma fell by 30 yuan. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed on the left.</p>

<p>The transaction of this cotton is particularly sluggish. However, the demand for American cotton in the Qingdao area is relatively strong, so people's hearts are still stable, but the intake of the factory in this port is very sluggish. The transaction situation of the current cotton is listed on the left.</p>

<p>Another foreign cotton market price, New York cotton market, initially fell slightly due to the sale of overseas cotton merchants in the morning, and then rebounded due to the purchase of peers and a part of short covering. As a result, the closing price rose by more than ten pounds of sound compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market rose five rupees including the forecast yesterday. Egypt closed the market.</p>
<p>The foreign cotton transaction in Shanghai is due to the expansion of the European war, the difficulty in shipping, the lack of inventory of the factory, and the Tianjin gang's vigorous purchase in Shanghai. There are more than a thousand packages of transactions every day. The inventory in Shanghai is almost sold out, so the selling price of the spot is extremely smart. According to general predictions, the selling price of the spot will continue to rise. The price of cotton market yesterday is listed below, converted into the factory price with the US exchange rate of 4.75,</p>

<p>Yesterday's securities dark market rebounded again, but the market had very little energy and was still seeking to get rid of a lazy situation. Only Lianhe largely covered the short position, which slightly increased the market price. There were slight differences in supply and demand in the market, temporarily isolated from the environmental news. Various markets such as gold, foreign exchange, and foreign stocks all showed signs of depression. Public debt transactions also had a slight improvement under a thousand, but they could not hold for long. Yesterday morning, the transaction was extremely clear. In addition to the retail investors' transactions, Yu Qi Tongkang slightly bought in, and the 16th and Yitai slightly sold. In the afternoon, Lianhe bought in more enthusiastically, and all three types of A, B, and C were needed, totaling about 200-300,000. At the same time, Xinchang and Datong also had a slight appetite. Although there were many supply accounts, the number was extremely limited. The market price of foreign stocks rose by one or two corners, so the result was generally better by about two corners. The total number of transactions was no more than 600,000 yuan. A simple list is provided below.</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to the previous day</p>
<p>Unified A 59.40 59.20 59.40 Up 0.20</p>
<p>Unified B 51.10 50.70 50.90 Also 0.20</p>
<p>Unified C 48.75 48.60 48.75 Also 0.20</p>
<p>Unified D 47.90 47.85 47.90 Also 0.20</p>
<p>Unified E 49.60 49.55 49.60 Also 0.25</p>
<p>In stock trading, 100 shares of Dachina Match Company were traded at a price of 24.25 yuan.</p>
<p>At the opening of the public business stock market, people's hearts were slightly hesitant, and the selling trend was stronger, and the market situation seemed soft, but soon the buyers of the real estate stocks could no longer bear it, and they gathered to buy, and the prices were suddenly improved, and the morning transaction was extraordinarily lively, until Xiangwu, the competitors began to slightly restrain, and there was a slight return wind at the opening in the afternoon, until one quarter of an hour before the evening closing, this wind became more severe, but the sellers did not show any signs of rushing to sell the stocks.</p>
<p>The development of the European war last Friday is the biggest reason for the general feeling of unease, but if there is no small echo in this market, it is enough to surprise people, so the future trend of the market depends on the news from the West, which goes without saying.</p>
<p>Among the real estate stocks, United British stocks still occupy the most important position. The highest price is 68.5 yuan, the lowest is 65.5 yuan, and the closing price is 66 yuan. China Reclamation stocks plummeted to 27.5 yuan at the opening, and instantly returned to a price of 30.25, and the closing price was 28.5 yuan. Except for Shanghai Bank, the rest closed at a price lower than the highest price in the day and slightly higher than the lowest price. Shanghai Bank opened at only 37.5 yuan, and after the opening, it soared to 41.5 yuan, and the closing price was only one yuan away from this price.</p>
<p>The situation of rubber stocks is slightly worse, and the price has fallen slightly more than last Friday. Due to various fears and over-considerations, the stocks of the Dutch East Indies rubber companies have fallen more than the stocks of the British Malayan companies.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Miscellaneous Grains: Oil Factories Enthusiastically Buy Soybeans <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's oil bean cake market situation was still stuck in a state of uncertainty. In the morning, because the appetite was very light, the price went down one chapter. In the afternoon, the atmosphere was full of bullishness, and the market immediately rebounded, completely recovering the losses. As a result, there was not much difference from last Saturday. However, because the road to soybean cake was lively (a total of 13,000 to 14,000 pieces of various cakes were traded yesterday), the oil pressing factories (operated by Japanese merchants) eagerly took in, and the market was able to stabilize. It is estimated that eight vehicles of Bengbu beans were traded at a price of 24.5 yuan, one vehicle of Nanjing beans at 22.5 yuan, three vehicles of Chuzhou beans at 23 yuan, and more than 300 bags of Xiashi beans at 22.3 yuan.

<p>The cloth market is based on the stability of foreign exchange, and current sales are sluggish. The stock of each cloth is increasing day by day, and the turnover of silver is difficult. People's hearts are downstream, and they are scrambling to sell, so the selling disks are uniformly soft. Each piece of white cotton fine cloth and fine twill fell by about one yuan, coarse cloth fell by 0.15 to 0.5, and the price drop of bleached and dyed cloth was quite different, from 0.5 to one yuan. Guest sales were sparse. Only the Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs purchased more than 300 pieces of colored cloth, printed goods, and fufu, and the Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan gangs only traded sporadically. Thousands of pieces of biqi colored cloth and other goods were purchased from Cebu and Singapore abroad. About 200 pieces of various goods were traded on this street. The retail business of the door shop also declined due to the expensive selling disks.</p>
<p>The decline in East piece goods continued to be fierce. The white cotton fine cloth and fine twill each plunged by 2.5 to 3 yuan. The closing price of 12-pound dragon head fine cloth fell to about 50 yuan. The Xianchu of Sijunzi biqi colored goods also fell to 1.435 yuan. Yesterday, the foreign firm took advantage of the cheap to purchase, because the medium-grade fine cloth fell the most tragically, and purchased more than 200 pieces. The Tianjin gang searched for hundreds of pieces of next month's futures fine cloth.</p>

<p>Recently, new tea from Hangzhou, Huzhou, and other roads has been arriving in swarms. More than 800 packages have been transported in recent days. The cost of coarse tea on each road has increased fourfold compared to previous years, and merchants are quite worried that it will not be easy to sell. As for the foreign firm market, yesterday was still quiet. Only Yongxing Baochang and other firms in the city purchased more than 200 boxes of Zhenmei green tea. The selling price of new goods was 465 yuan, and the selling price of old goods was 215 yuan, which was slightly weaker than before.</p>

<p>A total of sixteen pieces of new Du bamboo shoot clothes arrived. The market was raised to 160 yuan yesterday. The price was inevitably too high. If there are more arrivals of later goods, there is a possibility of turning loose.</p>

<p>At the end of last month, a play was performed at the Jishen Temple outside the Genshan Gate in Hangzhou to honor the gods, lasting for two days and nights. The troupe performing the play was said to have been hired from Jiahu at a very high price, with more than a hundred members, mostly famous actors from Beijing opera troupes. The young female lead was especially talented in both looks and skills, and the costumes were very bright and colorful, with linings and trousers made of five-colored silk. Therefore, not only did people from various villages outside the city flock from far and near, but even ladies from the city almost emptied the city to watch. The bannermen in the barracks especially went in groups. However, village temple performances have strict rules prohibiting children from going on stage. On this day, dozens of bannermen stood on the stage watching, and the villagers below the stage shouted to prohibit them. At first, the bannermen turned a deaf ear, and then they shouted and cursed loudly. The villagers were all indignant and shouted in unison, creating a situation where they were about to chase them away like hawks chasing pigeons. Dozens of people from the (咖哩) held the doors of the theater, fearing that they would escape. However, the bannermen thought they could rely on the entire camp and their male strength. They looked down on this remote village and thought it was not enough to satisfy their fists. At that time, there were about seventy or eighty bannermen watching the play in the temple. Only twenty or thirty of them were wearing light furs and loose belts, and looked gentle and refined. The rest were brave and fierce, and did not value their lives. Seeing the villagers' arrangement, they knew that the people on the stage would be caught. They agreed to start fighting together to seize the door and rescue the people.</p>

<h3 id="e106">The Character of a Mother (2) <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Mothers can be divided into several types: some are dissolute and do not fulfill their duties, some are innately unkind and sell their children, and some are as evil as Jesse in ancient times. We Christians should do some remedial work for such mothers. Generally, those who respect and love their mothers will do their best to protect women in any environment. There are various things in society that harm women, and we should work together to eliminate them. Otherwise, it would be a little ridiculous for us to promote "Mother's Day." (2) Beauty: The shape of a white flower signifies the beauty of a mother. This does not mean that all mothers are beautiful. Some mothers do not pay attention to their appearance. The beauty referred to here refers to the mother's life. Look at the hen leading the chicks, the cow leading the calf, how interesting. Mothers holding babies naturally look even more meaningful. The greatest book in the world is the picture of Mary holding the baby Jesus. This kind of beauty is inexhaustible. Late at night, a Christian mother holds her baby, sits by the stove, and gently sings a lullaby. This scene is no different from the picture painted by the artist of angels standing around the mother with joyful faces. A Western proverb says, "The hand that rocks the cradle, shakes the world." God entrusts the precious little life to the mother's hands, asking her to do holy work, so that this flawless childhood can receive good impressions from an early age. How beautiful is this life! (3) Love: The fragrance of a white flower signifies the mother's love. Flowers can bear fruit for people to eat. Even if they are picked and torn, their fragrance still lasts and can still make people feel happy. Mother's love is like this. Whether she is happy or sad, laughing or crying, she can bless those who approach her. The transformative power that God gives to people will weave a garment of personality for their children, to be worn forever."

<h3 id="e107">Sympathy School <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Chu</p>
<p>The contemporary British essayist E.V. Lucas once wrote an article describing his visit to "Sympathy School." Although the world may not really have such a school, it does represent a very new educational ideal, and we think it is worth introducing to our readers.</p>
<p>He said that the school's campus and buildings were very clean and pleasing to the eye, but as soon as he stepped into the school gate, he saw a boy of about nine years old, his eyes wrapped in bandages, and a slightly older girl carefully leading him to walk. In the reception room, he looked out the window and saw many happy children playing on the playground, but he felt very strange and sad that not all of these children were as lively and healthy as in the ideal. He saw two or three children with eyes that seemed to be sick, wrapped in bandages, watching other children lead them to walk. He also saw a girl walking with crutches, and it seemed that her limping leg had no hope of recovery.</p>
<p>The headmaster immediately explained to him: "She is valuable in that she doesn't really limp, but today is her 'Limping Day'; similarly, those children are not really blind, today happens to be their 'Blind Day'." She went on to say, "This is the main point of our education system: we don't instill many ideas into children, we want to inspire their sympathy and teach them to be able to appreciate the suffering that is judged to befall others, so we first let them taste the suffering themselves. In a semester, each of our children has a Blind Day, an Amputated Limb Day, and a Mute Day. On Blind Day, their eyes are absolutely tied tightly, and they are not allowed to peek. The bandages are put on the night before, and when they wake up the next morning, they are blind. So they have to rely on others for everything, and we also guide other children to help them in everything and lead them. This method is a very good education for both the children who pretend to be blind and the children who help the blind. It is certainly very painful to pretend to be blind, but many children say that Mute Day is the most terrible, because the mouth is not tied with bandages, and the children must use their willpower to not speak... Would you like to go to the campus and see for yourself?"</p>
<p>The headmaster led him to a child with his eyes bandaged, "Here is a gentleman who wants to talk to you," the headmaster said and ran away.</p>
<p>Lucas asked her, "Have you ever peeked?"</p>
<p>He said: "Ah, no, that would be cheating."</p>
<p>He also asked: "How do the children who lead you treat you?"</p>
<p>She said: "Very well. But when it's my turn to lead others, I will definitely be more careful than them. Children who have pretended to be blind are always very careful when leading others. It's really a painful thing to be blind, sir, would you like to try it yourself?"</p>
<p>He didn't try it, but he led her around the school for a week, and he told her what he saw, and she was very happy. After walking around like this, he felt that his heart was filled with kindness and that he was very able to care about other people's suffering.</p>
<h3 id="e108">The Power of a Wife <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Chuan</p>
<p>Being a wife is not merely, as Hitler said, providing for the soldiers on the battlefield. She can directly influence her husband's thoughts and career. Here, I recall a story:</p>
<p>During the Later Han Dynasty, there was a man from Luoyang named Yue Yangzi. One day, he found a piece of gold on the road and thought his wife would be delighted. So he hurried home, eager to tell her. Unexpectedly, his wife was not happy at all. She changed her expression and said, "I have heard the ancients say that Confucius would not drink the water from Robber's Spring, and an honest person would not eat food offered with contempt. How much more so should you not pick up lost things on the road! You think too little of your own integrity." These words made Yangzi feel ashamed, so he put the gold back on the road. He realized he lacked learning, so he went far away to seek a teacher. A year later, he returned home. His wife knelt down and asked him why he had returned. Yangzi replied, "It's nothing. I just missed you because it's been so long since we last met." His wife suddenly changed her expression, took a knife, and cut the silk on the loom into two pieces, saying, "The silk on this loom is woven from thread by thread, inch by inch, piece by piece. Now that you cut it, it's like wasting accumulated effort in vain. If you interrupt your studies, what difference is there between that and my cutting this silk? Think about it yourself." Yangzi was greatly moved. He realized that neglecting even a small amount of time could affect his entire education, so he continued his studies.</p>
<p>There are countless stories in history of wives influencing their husbands. For example, during the Song Dynasty, Madam Wang helped her husband Qin Hui commit treachery and seek glory, which is a very obvious example. Therefore, I advise all fellow women who have husbands to constantly supervise and guide them. If you discover that your husband is hoarding goods and profiting from the national crisis, you should quickly and earnestly advise him that profiting at the expense of others is no different from a hungry dog licking blood in a slaughterhouse. If he is momentarily confused, you should quickly awaken him and lead him back to the path of righteousness. Now, in these stormy times, the responsibilities of every man and woman are the same.</p>

<h3 id="e109">The Versatile Churchill <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Shichao</p>
<p>Winston Churchill, the former British Prime Minister, was a "happy warrior" and a "major player" in the American vogue. "Always ready to meet a challenge barehanded, always clashing with imaginary enemies." These two sentences perfectly capture Churchill's character.</p>
<p>He enjoyed participating in all kinds of debates. He adopted a hostile attitude towards all things and all people. His own Conservative Party considered him the most stubborn and difficult member to deal with. If he didn't attack something or someone for a moment, he felt uncomfortable. After forty years in the House of Commons, he was still resisting to the end.</p>
<p>Churchill was one of the most versatile figures in the world. He deserves the title of "Jack-of-all-trades." He seemed to be able to do everything and had done everything. He had been a war correspondent, soldier, politician, writer, fashion expert, polo player, bricklayer, and chef.</p>
<p>As a politician, he held more positions than any other British politician of his time. There was only one position he had not held, and that was the one he most coveted—Prime Minister. Now, he had even achieved that.</p>
<p>After the formation of the British National Government in 1931, Churchill became almost a political outcast. Although he was still nominally a member of the Conservative Party, his fierce attacks on the government meant that his party membership had effectively been revoked by the Baldwin faction.</p>
<p>Churchill's arrogant character and his love of reputation and power can be said to have been passed down from his father. His father, Randolph Churchill, was a famous Conservative politician. His mother was Jennie, the daughter of Jerome of New York. It is said that his particular American belligerence, love of adventure, and tendency towards sensationalism came from his mother.</p>
<p>Soon after returning to England in 1900, Winston began his political career. That year, he was elected as a Conservative Member of Parliament for the Oldham district. He competed with party leaders for six years. Shortly before the general election of 1906, he suddenly joined the Liberal Party, a move that shocked the whole country. His opponents called him a "turncoat" and greeted him with that title whenever they met, reminding him constantly.</p>
<p>In 1908, Churchill became a cabinet member for the first time as President of the Board of Trade. However, his real good fortune came in 1911, when he was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty and received a frank instruction from Prime Minister Asquith: "The fleet must be ready to fight at any time if attacked by Germany."</p>
<p>When the Labour Party came to power in 1929, Churchill was a thorn in the side of the MacDonald cabinet. By 1935, he had regained some ground within the Conservative Party. On the issue of India, about half of the party agreed with his views. During the First World War, Churchill handled his duties as First Lord of the Admiralty with ease. Therefore, Prime Minister Chamberlain had to ask him to take up the position again, to take advantage of his experience. This shows that his great talents were capable of handling difficult tasks. Churchill was born on November 30, 1874. After his marriage, he had two daughters and one son.</p>

<p>— K.</p>
<p>In his book "The Victorious Life," the famous American missionary and writer Dr. R. A. Torrey has the following insightful analysis of the grace to laugh:</p>
<p>The degree to which a person can laugh at himself is a measure of their character.</p>
<p>The lowest person is the one who never laughs.</p>
<p>The next is the one who only laughs at their own jokes.</p>
<p>The next is the one who only laughs at other people's jokes.</p>
<p>The noblest person is the one who can laugh at himself. Because a person who has the power to laugh at himself shows that he can examine himself objectively.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Casual Chat on the Shanghai Drama Scene <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Haixing</p>
<p>Today, the Shanghai drama scene is divided into three major groups: the Shanghai Drama Society, the China Traveling Troupe, and the New Art Drama Troupe, which has yet to perform publicly.</p>
<p>When the Shanghai Drama Society was performing at the Swatow Theater, most of the current key members of the New Art Drama Troupe were the backbone of the Drama Society. After "Last Remnants of the Late Ming" played in Shanghai for several days, Wei Ruhui suddenly left the Drama Society due to minor personal issues. At that time, Tang Huaiqiu, the head of the China Traveling Troupe, was active in Shanghai, so he cooperated with Wei Ruhui and others to revive the "China Traveling Troupe," performing at the Swatow Theater after the Drama Society. Soon after, the Drama Society signed a contract with the Lafayette Theater and moved to perform there. At this point, the drama scene had the two major forces mentioned above.</p>
<p>Wei Ruhui and others did not cooperate with the "China Traveling Troupe" for long, and they also left due to minor personal issues, and organized the New Art Drama Troupe, thus forming the current three-way split.</p>
<p>The foundation of the Drama Society is built on each member, so it is relatively solid and will not be affected by the intentions of one or two key members. The "China Traveling Troupe" is more professional, so the key members must take the greatest responsibility. Recently, Tang Huaiqiu has been facing many rumors from the outside world, so he is determined to work hard and respond with facts. As for the New Art Drama Troupe, it has not yet had any public relations performances, and the content is unknown. In short, the reason why the drama scene has become a three-way split is undoubtedly due to interpersonal relationships. The feeling of displeasure between individuals has not yet dissipated, which is undoubtedly a major obstacle to the development of drama. This phenomenon at this time and in this place is heartbreaking!</p>
<h3 id="e114">News from the Stage <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>Huang Jinxin, Ma Lianliang, Zhang Junqiu, and other top actors have arrived in Shanghai and will be on stage soon.</p>
<p>Female performers Meng Xiaodong and Zhang Eyun went to Hong Kong together from Shanghai. There was a rumor that they would perform at the Lee Theatre, but their trip is a sightseeing one, and it has not yet been decided whether they will perform on stage. As for Rui Qingrong's organizing a troupe, it has recently become quiet again, because the weather in Hong Kong is hot, and outdoor sports such as swimming are popular, so the business of theaters may not be guaranteed. Therefore, he changed his mind and plans to organize the troupe after the weather cools down in the autumn. However, some people hope to take advantage of Meng and Zhang's presence in Hong Kong for short-term speculation. Rui is still considering what to do.</p>

<p>Chapter 23 Old Friends and New Companions, Literature Has Value; Famous Scenic Spots are Well-Managed</p>
<p>It turns out that Xue Tianren has studied child psychology and pays great attention to toys. She said: Toys are children's gifts and are of great importance to children's family education. Therefore, she categorizes the toys produced in her factory by age. She said: Babies know how to hold toys from six months old. These toys are soft, brightly colored, and harmless to health. After one year old, there is another set. Two or three years old, another set. When entering kindergarten, another set. In a broad sense, adults also like toys. Regarding boys and girls, after the age of six or seven, there are gradually some differences. At this time, Zhu Airen also paid extra attention, because her Ming Ban Nursery also could not do without toys! After they finished eating, Jin Danyun suggested visiting Huiquan Mountain. Because Mrs. Sulia and the two Miss He are rarely here. At this moment, Huiquan Mountain is very beautifully arranged. Because the scenic spots of a place cannot be fully shown by the power of the government. It all depends on the people in the local area to lift together easily. Also because local autonomy is now developed, and Wuxi is still an area of industrial development. Today, there are two people in Wuxi toy stores who must buy toys. One is Mrs. Sulia, who likes to buy some Chinese local products wherever she goes in China and send them remotely to her daughter in the United States. So there are many Chinese furnishings in her American home. There is also the doctor Zhu Airen, who is returning to Anle Town tomorrow in the family car. She also wants to buy some toys to send to the children in her nursery. It's just that what Mrs. Sulia wants to buy is more refined. What Zhu Airen buys is more common. When everyone arrived at a toy store, Zhu Airen looked at their window decorations and said: "Hey! Aren't these the three little treasures from our place? How come they are here too?" At this time, the two Miss He went up to take a look and said: "Ah! It's really them! This photo looks really like them." It turned out that in the window, there were three dolls in the style of foreign girls, nearly a foot tall, either sitting or standing, forming a group. Their faces looked exactly like the triplets in the Fang family in the Anle Town Nursery run by Zhu Airen and others, exactly the same. Zhu Airen then asked Mrs. Xue: "Which company produces these three children clay figures in a group?" Mrs. Xue said: "What? They are also produced in our factory." Zhu Airen then told her that these were the Fang family triplets in our nursery. It is truly:</p>
