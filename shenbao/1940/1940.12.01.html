<p>社評</p>
<h3>無效之「攻勢」</h3>
<p>這在戰爭的世界之中，時常有新奇光怪的種種攻勢，不斷地搬演着，其間最爲世人所熟聞的，表面上以軍事攻勢爲主，却同時還有所謂政治攻勢與外交攻勢。</p>
<p>政治攻勢或與軍事攻勢同時並進，或在前，或在後，其主要的手法乃爲在對象國境內，扶植一種反動的勢力，以資內應；例如德國略取奧地利前之扶植殷嘉德，蠶食捷克時之支持蘇台德黨，以及後來進攻挪威時之卵翼「季斯林政府」，猛襲荷比時之利用第五縱隊，都是顯著的事實。</p>
<p>外交攻勢也是戰前或戰時用以輔助軍事的一種車要策略；例如去年八月，德國在侵略波蘭之前，先和蘇聯訂立互不侵犯協定，以免除東顧之憂，．今年六月希特勒於德軍行將攻抵巴黎城下之際，慫恿義國正式參戰，以收摧枯拉朽之效，這是外交攻勢的成功之傑作。</p>
<p>至於軍事攻勢，無非是憑戰略，和兵員器械的眞力，來作實際的行動，過去德國施用閃電戰術，連下波蘭挪威和西歐三國，固然是軍事攻勢的偉大成就，即以兵不血刃而佔領奧捷而言。又何嘗小是憑藉國社政府的優勢兵力。</p>
<p>凡百攻勢，成敗之數各佔一半：倘能運用得法。不難各有建樹；上述數例，皆因成功而益著；淹沒無　有却不知凡幾。但其間亦呈露着共通的性能，亦即包含一貫的賓主關係。質言之；一切攻勢必須以軍事爲主體，纔能得心應手；反之，如果沒有眞價實貨的作戰力量做後盾，則不論政治攻勢也罷，外交攻勢也罷，結果不但一事無成，往往「畫虎不成反類犬」，徒以自暴其醜。</p>
<p>舉例言之：（一）今年二月，蘇聯用兵芬蘭的時候，也曾扶植過一個所謂「顧辛南政府」，這是一種政治攻勢，但因軍事上久戰無功，而終於失敗了：幸而莫斯科當軸善自運用，能發能收，後來和芬蘭合法政府簽訂和約之日，此一不自然的組織便歸幻滅了：（二）今年九月，希特勒想在巴爾幹方面先發制人。於是便首先看中了羅馬尼亞的鐵衛團，扶植它，鼓勵它，終於釀成一幕迫宮的「苦迭打」，這自然也算得一種政治攻勢：但是日來正當羅國總理親往柏林簽訂盟約的時候，這被扶植的鐵衛團却利用機會，悍然搬演起「大報仇」來了，鬧得滿城風雨，人人戰慄，不成體統，此際德國如果越俎代庖，逕用武力來鎮壓，一則恐怕愈加引起羅國反德親英份子的憤激，（鐵衛團所仇殺的六十四名政治領袖，大多是過去主持親英政策的軍政當局），二則現在貝薩拉比亞區和黑海上虎視眈眈的紅軍，似乎也宋必肯熟視無覩；因此今後的羅馬尼亞，恐怕在短時期內，非但不能有助於軸心國，反而還要變成一種累贅，此殆希特勒發動政治攻勢之後，未能繼以軍事勝利的第一遭失敗。</p>
<p>以上是政治攻勢之失敗者，茲請再就失敗的外交攻勢，舉兩個最近實例：（一）今年九月二十七日，德義日三國成立同盟條約，這是聲勢相當浩大的一種外交攻勢，但其結果，德義旣未能在大西洋地中海方面有所建樹，日本在太平洋方面又不敢造次，甚至在美國態度强化，蘇聯堅持一貫方針的現實環境之下，三大盟國越發有同床異夢，貌合神離之概，於是此一攻勢，漸有成爲現代外交史中一大笑柄的可能了。（二）本月二十至二十四日之間，匈牙利，羅馬尼亞，和斯洛伐克相繼加入三國同盟，這當然又是希特勒不耐煩希臘戰事之曠日待久，而亟思在巴爾幹方面作澈底干涉之前的一種外交攻勢，其原意當然希望藉此鎖鍊，迫使可能假道的南斯拉夫與保加利亞兩國，共步匈羅諸國的後塵；不幸此一攻勢，竟因黑衫軍的節節敗退而夭折了，此際匪獨保國業已鮮明表示不願入盟，南國態度亦已相當轉變，即蘇土兩國的眞實意嚮，也不難於此獲見端倪：因此這幾天祇聞德國駐土耳其大使向土國政府保證不願參加巴爾幹戰事，而不聞國社軍向東南歐長驅直人。這一點史實，似乎更可說明沒有軍事勝利伴隨的外交攻勢，，也復必敗無疑。此何以故，知己知彼之結果，一切虛張聲勢皆歸失效了。</p>
<p>總之，一切政治攻勢或外交攻勢，如果祗能拿一些「移轉新陣地」或「自動撤退」一類消息伴奏的音樂，而不能繼之以實際的迅速的軍事成就，那麼，不問這攻勢如何浩大，仍然不免是一個潮濕了的爆竹」</p>

<p>局方發表風潮平息</p>
<p>據工部局情報處發表、公共租界華捕因不滿意米貼及局方昨日所宜布之增加房貼辦法、以致中央老閘兩捕房發生罷崗情事其餘各捕房、則較爲緩和、出事之後、經華董虞洽卿·暨警務處姚副總巡·與華捕代表晤談、經過情形、頗爲良好、現各華捕已一律照常上差、恢復要求、故上項風潮已告一段落、</p>
<p>華董保證圓滿答覆</p>
<p>虞洽卿氏以華捕怠崗、影響治安殊鉅、特於昨晨十時許、偕警務處華籍副處長姚曾謨親赴老閘捕房、向公共租界內八捕房華捕推舉之代表十六人、作懇切之勸告、對於華捕生活之苦痛、表示同情、並稱、華捕改善待遇之要求、由本人保證必獲圓滿答覆、希望爲顧全大局、立卽復崗、至所提條件、約定於星期一（二日）推派代表、與當局進行談判、全體代表、均深明大義、經虞氏勸告後、各代表隨卽回返捕房、分知全體華捕、卽時復崗、但以其時有若干華捕已離職出外、未曾知悉、故十時半後、僅有一部份復崗、至中午以後、秩序始恢復如常、</p>

<p>據英文大美晚報消息、捕房咋日仍在搜索前晨十時在海格路億定盤路被綁之銀行家朱博泉之行蹤、謠傳中與其同時被綁之朱夫人、則非事實、惟渠在其夫被綁後一小時卽行外出、迄未返其海格路六四四號住宅、致親友不知渠現在何處、朱夫人之離宅他去、據推測所知、乃由其夫被綁、住於本宅、感覺不安全、又聞在朱氏破綁前、曾接到恐嚇函數封、勒求爲數極鉅之款項、昨日下午、朱氏自備之四十八號汽車、已在兆豐公園北五十碼之田野中發現、據發現汽車者說、前晨有三農夫、會見一男子在汽車中呼援、並與車中另有着黑衣之三人掙扎圓脫，當發現汽車者十五分鐘後、邀同「市警』釗來時、巳人去車空、此汽車卽爲半小時前被綁者所乘之車、</p>

<h3>華捕罷崗後鬧巿情況一瞥　商店閉門儼如廢歷新年　交通混亂車輛幸未肇禍</h3>
<p>昨日上午，自華捕一千餘人實行罷崗後，致公共租界中區，頓陷於喧擾混亂之狀態中，蓋因指揮交通之巡捕旣减少，於是汽車之喇叭聲。煞車聲。以及人力車夫之叫喊聲，錯綜複雜，喧嘩如雷。同時沿南京路之各店舖，深恐發生事故，安全堪虞，乃紛紛閉門休業。四大公司，於消晨開市後，至上午十時左右，亦重復拉上鐵門，僅啟後門，以供出入。熱闊之南京路各商號，雖有數J家照常營業，然大部均行停業，幾如廢曆新正元旦現狀。</p>
<p>外灘至跑馬廳沿路一帶交通，擁擠不堪，在最爲忙碌之際，平時十分鐘之途程，須經半，J．時之久。十字路口，平時駐有華捕三四人指揮交通者，現僅有西捕一人代之，以致目送手揮，大有應接不暇之勢。且因西捕對於管理紅綠燈，缺乏經騐，故紅綠燈之啟閉，錯誤百出；而一般黃包車夫，平時對華捕畏之如虎，如無乘客，不敢在馬路上空車閒蕩，但昨日上午，則大有逍遙自在之概。上星期所受安全第一之訓，早已置之腦後矣。</p>
<p>虞洽卿路口，則僅有一西籍三道頭，司開啟紅綠燈之職。福建路口，亦僅有一西捕指揮交通。最熱鬧之浙江路口（卽日昇樓）係五叉路口，平時除由一印捕在路中高亭上司掌開啟紅綠燈外，復有華捕多名，在交义路口幫同維持交通，今則此高踞路中之五路總司令（印捕），巳不復見此複雜之交通綫，僅有電車公司西籍查票員數人暫代指揮之職。其餘各普通路口，鮮見捕踪，此種情況，實屬罕見。</p>
<h3>尤素珍小姐　義務伴舞徵募難童寒衣　日期：今晚九時半起至二時止　地點：福煦路銀都舞宮</h3>
<p>本市福煦路戚海衛路口銀都舞宮，首席紅星尤素珍小姐，爲望族名媛，因受環境之關係，數年前下海伴舞於維也納，紅極一時，名震全國，但八一三前即息隱家園，深居簡出，度其名媛生活，上月銀都開慕挽友情騁，而二度下海，風頭之健，不减當年，實可稱紅星之王，尤小姐平生急公好義，頗有丈夫氣槪，因鑒於邇來氣候趨寒，時見報載有街童凍斃消息，故商仝銀都當局同意，定今晚九時半起至子夜二時止，義務伴舞一天，但此日恕不買票外出，該天所得全部舞金，悉數捐助難童寒衣之費，實屬難能可貴，全　不乏樂善慷槪大善士，希望熱烈贊助尤小姐之義舉，幷且要求舞國數千姊妹，羣起響應，則從此難童寒衣有着，此亦舞國姊妹非常光榮之事也！</p>
<h3>滬寗車被炸死者達百人　傷二百五十人　事態極端嚴重</h3>
<p>據英文大美晚報昨日（三十日）午後二時甫過所得可靠消息、前日（廿九日）蘇州附近火車被炸案中喪生者、咋日增至近一百人、另有負傷者至少二百五十人、內傷勢沉重者頗多、</p>
<p>埋地雷者早已引退</p>
<p>可靠日人聲稱、該列火車、載客數百人、由滬駛寗、參加咋日之簽約禮者、在距蘇州五哩處中華方游擊隊所置地雷、轟然爆發、致車被炸離軌道，埋雷者則已引退、故未捕獲、查該車被炸、機頭與火車五節出軌毀壞、碎片飛至數百碼外、</p>
<p>日文報紙隻字不提</p>
<p>日總令署對此案昨日仍守緘默、且禁日方　紙載此消息、故本市日方報紙咋晨隻字不提、衆信埋雷者係謀炸定時火車駛出不久後離滬之專用快車一列、因信其中載有赴寗之日方官員多人也、出事後、火車交通立卽停頓、許多人擬赴江寗者、皆不能成行、</p>
<p>事態嚴重前所罕有</p>
<p>至前晚火車碎片等始經淸除、而能恢復定時交通、聞今日車行如常、查此案係中國鐵路歷史上罕見之嚴重事件、華方游擊隊斷續轟炸鐵路事、迭有所聞、而滬寗路屢遭游擊隊襲擊者、已逾二載、惟所施損壞多係輕微性質耳、</p>
<p>事先佈置似極審愼</p>
<p>此間觀察家相信、游擊隊事先佈置昨日之轟炸已久、且對各種詳細辦法、進行頗爲審慎、以期一舉奏功、度華方將以事實反證日寗變方無力控制其主要中心地昆連各區、</p>
<p>大批棺木運往盛屍</p>
<p>又據消息可靠方面稱、　被炸之車輛、係三等客車、當駛經出事地點時、地雷突然爆發、轟然一聲、火車頭首當其衝、被炸成粉碎、同時車頭後之客車共有八輛被炸及、其他各節車則均告出軌、斜倚路畔、事後發覺死傷者男女老幼約三百餘人、該項被炸斃屍體、事後均堆置軌道旁空地上、搭有小帳幕多座、以蔽屍體、至該處被燬路軌及枕木等、當晚卽行修復、咋日滬蘇兩地、均裝有大批棺木前往出事點、俾將屍體盛殮、</p>
<p>車站檢查異常苛細</p>
<p>大中社記奢咋自車站方面獲悉、外跨塘被炸路軌、卽於當晚修竣、故昨日由上海開往南京各班客車、已照常行駛、因滬寗交通中斷一日、致乘客倍形擁擠、而車站檢查、亦較前嚴密、在進入售票處之門口、日方憲兵三四名、荷槍兀立、見有乘客蜂湧而前者、卽以槍刺向人攔截、後以木桌攔成二孔道、分別男女兩行、以備「路警」對乘客實施極度威脅性之搜查、卽細微之什物、亦再三盤詰、如乘客稍形擁擠、卽以木棍亂扛驅逐、以致弱，婦幼孩、呼號奔走、狀極狼狽、對小件紗布紙烟等、卽予沒收、又據無錫來客談、渠前日來滬時所乘之客車越過外跨塘將至唯亭站時，（約距離二十餘里）陡聞後面轟然一聲、其響如雷、可見當時爆炸之猛烈、</p>
<h3>餘姚商民出口　槪須具保領證</h3>
<p>自滬赴浙旋客、近日紛粉取道乍浦餘姚轉達往返、餘姚縣政府茲爲防止壯丁漏海、保障正當商人出口起見、特訂定餘姚縣商人居民出口通行證暫行辦法、無論本外縣居民、由餘姚沿岸或菴東出口、均須填具申請書及二千元以上殷實舖保、繳納證書費、准發出口通行證、方能出口、證書費商人壯丁每名十元、學生或在十五歲以下四十以上、每名五元、現已決定自十二月一日起實行、</p>
<h3>鄒夫人今日設奠</h3>
<p>法捕房政治處秘書鄒承鼎君之元配夫人陸熊珍女士、於本年九月二十八日寅時、疾終上海產婦醫院、茲擇於國歷今日（一日）假上海八仙橋靑年會為其夫人設奠領帖、鄒君交游素廣、屆時都君親友、均將前往弔唁、</p>
<p>暫時不上差之華捕，昨晨或獨自一人在街上閒蕩，或三五成羣，且行且談，頗有閒情逸致之趣。卽有一二指揮交通之在差華捕，亦沒精打彩，每隔數分鐘，輒離崗閒步片刻，或與路人作淸談。若干印捕，則似抱隔岸觀火之態度，當記　向某一印捕詢問其意見時，渠莞爾而語曰：「彼等當然要罷崗，蓋所得不敷開支也，卽我等之薪金，亦何嘗入能敷出。」幸治安臨時由萬國商團出而維持，以每組五人爲一隊，在各地往來梭巡，西捕頭則乘機器脚踏車在各馬路兜馳。</p>
<p>但中區交通雖如此混亂，而車輛肇禍之事，則並未發生，據救火會職員解釋，或因各人皆特別小心，故無意外之學。同時盜刦案，亦無如意想中之增多，大批華人立於馬路轉角處，以驚異之目光，注視牛步化交通工具之前進。學童數十人，在南京路中段遊嬸，汽車多輛停於不准停車之區，但無人加以干涉。除中區以外，其他各處混亂之情形，尚不多見，蓋因罷崗之華捕，僅限於中央與老閘兩捕房也。</p>

<p>公共汽車縮短路綫</p>
<p>當時公共租界之公共汽車、顯以避免實外起見、除七路外、均駛至靜安寺爲止、沿愚國路及極司斐　路、「市警」與日憲兵人數、大見增多、而在出事地點戒備尤嚴任何人均不准出入、</p>
<p>受傷日兵名佐佐木</p>
<p>社聞社云昨日下午三時三十分、滬西越界築路區內、又發生日軍一名被狙擊、緣當時有日憲兵行經大西路汪家弄時突被預伏該處之男子一名、用手槍向其開槍狙擊、該憲兵應聲中彈後、亦拔槍還擊、致該處擺設皮匠攤之皮匠一名、被流彈擊　要害身死、事後日方得訊、派出大隊意兵及「警察」在該弄一帶施行警戒並在弄口安置鐵絲網、嚴密搜查行人車輛、但並無所獲、據悉被　受傷之日軍係憲兵電曹、名佐佐木、並悉出事後日方除將汪家弄用木樁釘斷封鎖外、並將該弄按戶傳去一人、詢問出事情形、至佐佐木之傷勢、則甚沉重、</p>

<h3>轟然一聲濃烟直冒　南巿離奇巨響</h3>
<p>昨晨九時許、南市忽發生轟然巨響一聲、當時居住法租界與南市靠近地帶之居民類多聆得、據稱推測其響聲發源地、似在南市高禺廟江南造船所附近、同時有人發現在巨響米發生以前、目覩有飛機一架、在該處飛行、旋有黑色物件下墮、即生巨響、繼之且有濃烟冒起、至該巨響從伺而生、則一時實無法探知、</p>

<h3>巴爾幹方面　德與蘇聯的暗門</h3>
<p>蘇聯外交委員長莫洛托夫上月率領大批人員答訪柏林，各方都很重視。實則此行對於德蘇兩國貌合神離的關係，並無多大影響。下面是紐約泰晤士報駐土耳其伊斯丹埠及駐匈牙利京城訪員的無綫電報告，讀者可作莫洛托夫訪德之背景看，茲分　邊譯於後：</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>德國勢力侵入巴爾幹，並不使人驚異，德軍的開入羅馬尼亞，事前也早有所聞·所可駭異者，却不在巴爾幹而在莫斯科。</p>
<p>在兩個月前，蘇聯政府會以迅雷不及掩耳的手段，要求雜馬尼亞割讓貝薩拉比亞和布柯維那兩地。自後卽在巴爾幹全部採取有力的反德攻勢，尤注重於保加利亞和羅馬尼亞兩國，常由第三國際傳令當地共產黨員，從事活動。</p>
<p>匈牙利是德國掠奪巴爾幹糧食的倉庫，保加利亞共產黨曾在那裹竭力活動，散佈各種印刷品，大事宜傳。多腦河委員會議，亦未能使德蘇關係復趨融洽。蘇聯雖以多腦河國自居要求列席，然而德政府却認爲不值一顧。</p>
<p>德國雖不能在蘇聯境內作對抗宜傳，但也不斷在巴爾幹全境招募訓練白俄移民，一朝有事，卽可加入德軍作戰。就記者所知，蘇聯對此巳得有證據。</p>
<p>可是蘇聯竟仍聽任德國的傀儡，在羅馬尼亞掌握政權，阻止石油和糧食運往蘇聯，並設立一個半親德，半親義，而完全反對蘇聯的政府。蘇聯要想擴展根據地，以抵抗德國對於保加利亞南斯拉夫的最後進攻，幾已因此完全絕望，眼看自已在兩國的勢力，已爲德國全部打消了。</p>
<p>所奇怪者，蘇聯目覩德國勢力伸張到黑海沿岸，直達本國門戶——博斯布魯和達達尼爾兩海峽。臥榻之旁，不容他人酣睡，而蘇聯竟處之泰然，聲色不動，無怪世人都要爲之迷惑不解，大有「莫測高深」之歎了。</p>
<p>這一個「蘇聯之謎」的謎底，究竟是些什麽？是否斯太林已爲希特勒所收買，許以兩處海峽的管理權，和近東或遠東的其他掠奪物？這事恐未必然。假使德國果有此種誘餌，蘇聯亦未必認爲具有永久價值，而甘受其欺。</p>
<p>主持蘇聯政策的人，當然不會發生此種錯覺。德國最近的兩個行動，具着伺種意義，在最近的將來，他們將有何種遭遇？他們早已看得淸楚了。</p>
<p>蘇聯今日，一方面抱着沉機觀變的態度，一方面則力守秘寗，使國內人民，不知道前途形勢的嚴重，這原是斯太林一貫的作風。因此一班駐在莫斯科的新聞記者，竟至毫無消息可以報道，何况自本年一月以來，蘇聯政府已實施「全部檢查，」卽使能稍有所知，或加以猜測，亦無法傳至外界，記者案頭，有一封曾受過「全部檢查」的雷稿，使是個絕好證明。</p>
<p>德國漠視蘇聯對於多腦河的要求，並拒絕其預聞重行分配歐亞兩洲之事，自已的勢力則遂步向着蘇聯門戶伸展，蘇聯政府竟會事事隱忍，祇有一個現實，可資說明。這就是因爲蘇聯今日的實力，自視尚不能與德國分庭抗禮。這並不是說蘇聯政府將永還這樣的容忍着，不過她要放棄對德友誼的外表，而實行自衛，尚須靜待時機呢。</p>
<p>據記者個人觀察，蘇聯非至冬季，波蘭和羅馬尼亞的道路不便行軍，德國機械化部隊難於通過之時，不會有何舉動，甚或須待德軍在近東及菲洲戰事方酣，無暇兼顧之際，方始發動。</p>
<p>到那時期，蘇聯的計劃，將以全力支持其與國土耳其，以阻止德國勢力的再度伸展。德國方面亦深知1入冬季，蘇聯卽可揭開假面具，而喝阻德國暗中威脅的態度，這就是德團在巴爾幹半島急於行事的緣故吧？</p>
<p>此間盛傳着一個由羅馬尼亞傳來的事故，足證德蘇兩國友誼的冷淡。據說曾有大批雞蛋，由蘇聯運德，曾在貝薩拉比亞被蘇聯當局扣留，不知道是有意還是無意，祇因被扣多日，雞蛋已經變壤，待到放行以後，火車始緩緩開入德境。車上仍貼着德人所常在蘇聯車輛上貼的標語。．「這又是德蘇友誼的證據。」</p>
<p>蘇聯當然算到展緩一天衝突，卽多增－天實力。蘇聯當局無論在國內國外，對於外國的探問，總是說：「我們希望不牽入這次戰事漩渦，」此言自有幾分實在。</p>
<p>當然他們要不牽入戰爭漩渦，且必須不牽涉戰爭漩渦，然而他們也深知道終於不能不牽入戰爭漩渦。蘇聯政府的問題，就是他們至何時方可加入這次戰爭。究應在H下糧食充足，防禦未固的時候發動呢：還是要等到隆冬，氣俟奇寒，交通困難，糧食不足的時候呢</p>
<p>蘇聯今日雖似麻木不仁，並非暗示她不能作戰，或不能奮力作戰，以保衛國家地位；祇因一且作戰，不僅蘇聯全部制度並且是她國家基礎，都不免要作孤注一擲，因此不能不出以十二分的審慎了。</p>
<p>記者曾向一目覩蘇聯軍隊進佔波蘭情形的人，詢以蘇聯戰車實力如何。</p>
<p>他答道：我不知道蘇聯戰車當時在沼澤中單獨進行的情形如何。我確曾見到幾輛遺棄的戰車，但就我記憶所及，祗見無量數的戰車，蠕蠕而動，絡繹不絕。偶有一二輛陷入泥綽，不能行動，也不見有人過問，一轉瞬間，已爲前後左右的車輛，遮蔽得無影無踪了。</p>
<p>據說他們的重砲成行排列，幾於車輪相接，不可計數，芬蘭孟納漢防綫的攻破，就是得力於此。蘇聯有着男敢的兵士，和充足的軍備，質雖不如德國，量或不相上下，一旦有事，大概卽將用以抵抗德軍的前進吧！（十月十二日自土耳共伊斯丹埠發）</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>本年八月，德國在維也納舉行會議，把歐洲的後門砰然關住，餉蘇聯以閉門羹，旋又派兵開入羅馬尼亞，把這後門嚴扁起來。現在德國L把巴爾幹方面的「生存空間」，逐漸充滿，對於羅馬，已無餘地可容，莫斯科更輪不到了。</p>
<p>希特勒的外交手段眞是精明，維也納的仲裁會議，使匈牙利上了德國的圈套，又使羅馬尼亞全國陷於紛亂。他以羅馬尼亞被瓜分後的領土保護人自居，顯然是針對其他各國而發，使在潑魯特河躍躍欲試的紅軍望而却步，他與日本同盟，更使斯太林有後顧之憂，至於他在勃倫納山隘與墨索里尼的決策，尤有水到渠成之勢。</p>
<p>德蘇關係因此入一新階段。德國對蘇的威脅視前尤亟，若非克林姆宮主人不惜與軸心國一戰，就祗能聽從國社黨的指敎，而限制其發展於近東一帶。</p>
<p>所奇怪的是柏林與莫斯科的鈎心鬥角，雖以國運作孤注，小國爲犧牲，而合作的烟幕仍維持如故。由高加索輸送至德國，以供軍用的煤油，較前有增無减，德國代表團前往蘇聯者，亦絡繹不絕。</p>
<p>自從維也納仲裁會議把羅馬尼亞一再犧牲，以饜足保加利亞的慾望之後，巴爾幹政治家多以爲德蘇糾紛，已迫於眉睫。匈牙利外交部長查基曾在國會外交委員會中宣稱，匈牙利應準備「流血的犧牲」，以防患於未然。混亂的羅馬尼亞方面更不斷傳出潑魯特河一帶邊境多事的謠言。假使蘇聯有一兵一卒，跨過中歐方面目前的國界，就無異是越境侵德，勢將引起釁端了。</p>
<p>但是東歐方面醞釀中的事變，較之柏林與莫斯科的劃分利益，尤爲嚴重。</p>
<p>蘇德兩國界綫，起自波羅的海，沿着瓜分的波蘭，傀儡的斯洛伐克，傾向軸心的匈牙利，然後越過國土日削的羅馬尼亞邊界，而直達多腦河三角州的北端，以迄於黑海。這界錢的南方與西方莫非德國的保護地，僅是保護的方式微有不同罷了。</p>
<p>德國正在這條界綫後面，鞏固實力。由於德方的擊持，羅馬尼亞與保加利亞的人口交換終於實行，卽在杜不魯甲北部的保加利亞人，統統南遷至保加利亞境內，蘇聯和斯拉夫族的保加利亞中間，因之挿入一個非斯拉夫族的緩衝地帶。</p>
<p>德國駐土耳共大使巴本，曾親口對記者說過，德國決不能坐視「海峽」落入蘇聯之手。理出很明顯：威廉二世曾擬定柏林至報達的三B路綫，而「海峽」適當要衝，希特勒旣未明白放棄這一計劃，又何能容忍蘇聯的控制呢？</p>
<p>當德國希望把蘇聯檳諸巴爾幹門外之際，雙方都在暗中努力佈置。兩國間的根本衝突，在戰前原已存在，在開戰之後，亦未消弭。大日耳曼主義與大斯拉夫主義，相鬥甚烈，同時義大利也一手向蘇聯索取原料，一手又抗拒蘇聯侵入地中海勢力範圍。</p>
<p>德國的東進政策一向是要從多腦河順流而下。有一句老話說，「自維也納到黑海，每晚可以在德國村莊內歇宿。」</p>
<p>德國與東歐各國大然的經濟聯繫，是一個强大的力量。就在平時，這一帶的貿易也有一半以上屬於德國。如以糧食和原料換取生產品，以優等燃料供給德國工業，換取製成品，是其犖犖大者。現在海道已因被封鎖，陸路貿易自然更趨繁榮了。</p>
<p>德國向非斯拉夫族的巴爾幹國家和富有資產的反共產階級活動，以抵禦大斯拉夫主義和共產主義，亦是一種有力的號召。匈羅兩國，本已受斯洛伐克，斯洛文克，塞爾維亞，魯地尼亞，波蘭，俄羅斯，保加利亞和烏克蘭等人種的包圍，一旦蘇聯席捲歐陸，便將在斯拉夫人種的茫茫大海中，孤舟飄泊，有呼籲無門之苦了。</p>
<p>大斯拉夫主義的神秘力量，是東南歐方面一種驚人的要素。保加利亞農人有一句老話，一遇困難，便要說：「伊凡老公公就要順流而下，來帮助我們了。」統治克林姆宮的是沙皇還是共黨，在他們頭腦簡單，以耕耘爲生的人看來，是無關緊要的。保加利亞京城條菲亞巍峨宏壯的禮拜堂，就是爲紀念與土耳其戰爭的俄軍而築。</p>
<p>因此在親善的假面具下，軸心國與蘇聯的暗鬥之烈，正方興未艾。克林姆宮對於德國雖撫慰有加，而同時在羅馬尼亞，南斯拉夫，和保加利亞境內，都充斥着傳單小冊，滿紙攻擊德意的帝國主義，對於英國反無隻字道及。義大利人祇談蘇聯的大患。德國人則誇口說只要時機一到，卽將掃蕩紅軍，易如砍瓜切菜。（十月十二日自匈牙利城發）</p>

<p>昨日米市又利用某方扣留運米入租界、期造成一　嚴重局面、另一方面爲日軍艦駛入西貢港內、並將對南進有所舉動、遂有西貢輪運停頓之說、以是投機囤戶、在米市塲上活躍異常、行情高抬、肆無忌憚、混亂不堪、一號西貢邏繼現貨立漲達八十一元、二號七十七元、均爲創見之新高價、而英華司一號喊九十四五元買進、尚無售出、十二月開九十一元後尚圖喊高、二號十二月份自八十七元半大至八十九元、小絞十二月份上午八十四元半至八十四元九角、午後至八十五元半、盡比前日漲起二元左右、尚有　漲之勢、米業中亦覺如此情形、公開究有所不便、遂亦停　市、即開市塲緊急會議、謀遏制辦法、討論結果、致函評價委員會務即着手進行評價、以維民食、散會已在十一時、午時漲風略緩、交易亦復減少、現米總計不足萬包、英華司衹三百多噸、評價委員會種種要求、早爲工部局所採納、一則不無自身利害關係、再則囤戶之中、頗多有財有勢、莫可奈何、三則認真去做、又恐開罪同業、所以眼開眼閉、不死不活、市政當局亦無暇顧及、其實租界治安種種問題、皆由米貴而起、囤米備荒、並不是壞事、可是一意操縱居奇、咎無可逭、故以安定米市平準米價爲要着、</p>
<h3>囤戶注目洋粉　洋麥繼有定購</h3>
<p>麵粉　日昨洋粉市況、步見俏利、蓋以連日客囤吸收不遺餘力、出月交解之路貨拋售已經不少、更兼租界當局、以廠粉產量不敷、擬將洋粉撥供本街平價、是以投機囤戶趁此拉抬、聞新到澳洲粉鐘樓牌現貨、已可提交、昨由本客　辦　千五百包、價達十九元二角、高牌美粉均站二十元左右、市面逐挺、又聞月初交解之路貨洋粉、花鳥及鐘樓牌價、均由十八元八角升至十九元、綜計拋開七千五百餘包、至二號粉廠盤仍爲十八元、由兩廠　出　千包光景、不敷本街之用、幫洋粉均爲本客所垂青云、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日來源仍稀、除車運杜麥零星裝到、　解日廠外、販戶到源更寥、日廠方面、以杜麥吸收困難、亦不得不注意洋麥、聞三鑫廠有定購兩船之說、合價一十四元、一說係華廠所訂購、目下一時尚難證實、市塲交易久已呆滯、滬埠小麥市塲、無形中已達絕路、實爲目下環境所致云、</p>
<h3>雜糧亦抬</h3>
<p>邇　米市、在投機狂風侵蝕下、市價步步升高、迄今已非一般平民所能負担、中下階級菲不紛紛改食麵粉、而粉價又見頻漲、於是近鄉貧民又被迫而將苞米大麥等豬食原料充飢矣、詎料糧蠢喪心病狂、認爲良機不可坐失、竟亦跟隨米價猛抬、昨日西貢苞米在囤戶吸收驟升一元有奇、每市担價達廿二元七角、紅糧亦高昂至二十元〇六角、同時麩皮創十九元八角空前未有高價、長此以往、貧民勢將坐以待斃也、</p>
<p>大宗餅豆運香港</p>
<p>昨（三十日）、有豆子　百五十包、運往香港、今（一日）、亦有八百二十包豆子、及豆餅六千一百張、生　七百包、芝蔴二百五十包、俱運香港、裝運新加坡、有豆子七百三十包及芝蔴八百四十五包云、</p>
<h3>證券　外債漲風　摶扶而上</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市況、因本埠謠言　盛、下午交易暫行停市、以備上午所成交者交割清楚、市況則頗見紊亂、鴻大胡鶴、買進甚力、信昌收購亦不弱、故戊丁丙三種先疲後堅、賣方順昌有二十萬出籠、信孚生大亦頗有賣出、十六號賣出甲種甚湧、雖有聯益吸收、仍未能立定、遽打破七十三元關、趨勢堅中帶軟、恐一時不易看好、且環境謠言蠢起、人心不無惴惴耳、市價結果、丙丁戊三種回好五分、獨丁種漲四角之多、乙種衹小五分、甲種又大跌六角、紊亂之狀、市價顯有不自然之情形、成交約七八十萬元、茲列半日結果、簡明表於後、</p>

<h3>經濟叢談</h3>
<p>— 馮柳堂</p>
<p>雅片</p>
<p>何謂籠頭，以竹龍舖紙，而將所熬之土汁，從紙　濾過，其汁水均在下，而紙面　留滯才即土渣也。早年均棄去，年來雅片貴，故弄堂中常聞「阿　籠頭渣」之呼聲，由可　渣亦值踐矣。</p>
<p>雅片有大土小土之分；大土有公班，喇莊之分，如現在所玩之足球大小，外以菸葉數層爲皮，皮厚約一四分不等，內貯土漿，臭之有異香。買大土者恒取其皮薄則肉（即漿）多，故買原隻之大土，與揀買文旦一般，以兩手捧土，而以兩大指按捺之，如皮　熟而內容結實者佳。可是土至了門售店後，無論原隻零翦，內容恐不能完全是原貨了。因爲門售店家能用巧妙的手術，揀大土的皮面某一處浸潤了，再將土皮　層　層剝開，開成小圓孔，而將裏面土漿挖出來，拌和許多充作土的料子，重行裝回去，仍將土皮照樣封好，烘乾，與原狀無二。所挖出的一部分土漿，將來另作大土的出賣，這是賣塲上一種舞弊。</p>
<p>小土，有赤莊金花等稱，與大土不同，大土內是漿質，小土則堅實，大小如拳狀，每包　隻，用紙包裹。此外尚有川土，產於四川，作圓丘狀，　底扁半。雲土四川土爲軟。此外有台漿來自台州；象漿來自象山；其他產地甚多，名目　繁，據光緒年間調查，沒有幾省不種土，尤其是山西陝甘諸省，因爲距海邊，洋土不易得，遂不得不自種自吸了。</p>
<p>雅片有　時的提神興奮及麻醉止痛止瀉之力，故稱之爲　藥，並以避免吸食雅片之禁令。其已煎成之烟膏有名之曰富壽膏，以見其功效之大。又呼之爲芙蓉膏，這是從罌粟花　爲阿芙蓉而來，故稱吸雅片者爲芙蓉館主，而其實有如民國初元新舞台夏月珊所演的黑籍冤魂了！至於爲什麼要吸雅片也曾向許多癮君子討論過，說來話長，非本文所能及。</p>
<p>清光緒季年，受新政之推盪，及與學之效果，咸知雅片爲滅國滅植之因，於是禁烟之說又盛。查當時印土逐年運銷中國，　載：光緒五年以前，每年進口約七萬餘箱，每箱售五百兩，中國收稅三十兩。光緒廿七年劉坤一張之洞曾擬雅片公賣，以爲光緒廿五年洋藥進口五萬九千一百六十一担，前五年大約在五萬担上下，最多一年爲六萬三千一百餘担，最少一年爲四萬八千九百餘担，以時價每兩值銀五錢計算，足值銀五千萬兩，故主張設局官賣，照時價每兩加二成出售，每年可得盈餘一千萬兩，事雖未行，然而後來領昭吸烟，終於將土行閉歇，未始不是此爲動機，雖是私烟越禁越好賣，畢竟是印土絕跡了。</p>
<p>可是印土雖絕跡，而代印土以興的烟土，以及烈於烟土之代用品，又不知有多少，愈演愈烈，近聞除紅丸白麵之外，尚有所謂「哈」者，二哈即過癮，但是毒更甚於「紅白」，不到一年，形銷骨立，毒瘡遍體了！（完）</p>
<h3>金融　賣戶猶豫不出　外滙遠期需要旺</h3>
<p>外　　日市況，滙豐掛牌、　無上落、英美滙暗市、以月終　帳，交易略清、惟受謠言影響、投機商續來扒吸、賣戶猶豫、售價扳緊、更因遠期需要者多、故走勢與現貨拔開、午收結果、英金現貨告三辦士七〇三一二五、美滙五元七八一二五、較上日軋緊〇一五六二五、與〇三一三五、午後週六無市、</p>
<p>人心受謠風激盪</p>
<p>晨　以倫敦　條、　遠期　　一二五、紐約銀價仍　　　生金呆定、滙兌英對美滬等均半、美對　　二五、　滬少　分、對法無市、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士七一八七五、美滙五　八一二五、　後投機商已入市結納、尚以華商銀行塞出相抵　價無變動、十二月份美滙投機商進華行上海五元八一二五、滙豐掛牌揭曉各滙一致勿更、白銀平衡稅揭曉低百分之〇·七五、是時人心微起猜疑、於是投機商繼續購吸期貨美滙、計某美行出投機商十二月份五元七八一二五、以至七五、午收現貨英金三辦士七〇三一二五、美滙五元七八一二五、下月份英金三辦士六八七五、美滙五元七五、計現貨英美兩滙、軋緊〇一五六二五與〇三一二五、期貨縮〇三一二五及〇六二五、</p>
<p>香港英美無變動</p>
<p>香港三十日（週六）電、今晨滙市開盤平穩、英滙現期貨及美滙現貨均無榮辱、申滙現貨升一元、爲四百〇二元五角、日滙現貨緊一元、爲一百〇三元五角、十一時三十分告平、各滙概無變動、下午週六無市、</p>

<h3>掉期方過　金市買風四起</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗市、爲第　期轉入第三屆掉期日、於晨八時至九時舉行、仍由買方貼出予賣方、八點不到、即有做開、首由兩銀號對掉五百兩、貼價爲六元、後買方證券幫銀號來貼出、故見步昂至正式掛價　已升至十二元、後更步升至十五元、繼因金號與錢莊貼進、最　趨穩、爲十四元、第二屆現金期交於九點三十分開市、趨勢堅挺、乃掉期後、買方四起活動、外滙又報來趨緊、開市即月至五千八百元關口、見高銀號趁機出籠、亦有加碼來售者、曾見銳退至五千七百七十二元、但外滙步軟、人心向上重將買風掀動、被抬上至五千八百五十二元、終見散多出籠、收市五千八百三十八元、計軋升七十五元、現金無價無市、銀樓飾金掛大十元、關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤升七十五元</p>
<p>晨初橫跳三十餘元、金號入銀號二十兩、五千八百元、開後狀滯、而銀號幫賣出、回進八百元關內、計證券幫出金號三十兩、爲五千七百七十二元、不久外匯報縮、人心向上、買戶咸集、狂抬至五千八百五十二元、計證券幫進銀號二十兩是也、以上證券幫暨銀號搜購最力、後散戶獲利稍出、漲勢遂阻、計銀號沽予金號三十兩、爲五千八百三十五元、延至收盤、金銀號對做二十兩、尚告五千八百三十八元、比上日軋升七十五元、半日上落有八十元、現金號之本牌金售價、較烚赤高十餘元、收進低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元、均無做開、</p>
<p>飾金高懸六百元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出、計升十元、大同行懸六百元、新同行與上價相仿、收進低三十元之譜、</p>
<h3>外幣大都提高</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市面、因特殊關係、故無正式行情、惟塲外喊價、主要各幣大都提高、英美金鎊隨金價各升二元、英金票亦漲五角、美金票叫高至十七元四角、此上日計升二角七分、此外均無變動、日金票仍爲一元五角四分、朝鮮票趨勢仍挺、晚市略高至一元一角八分半、</p>
<p>上月匯劃息亦減</p>
<p>上海銀行業聯合準備委員會訂定十一月份同業滙劃存款息、爲每千元二元、（即合月息二　、較十月份減低一元）、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗行市不刊布　散市後又復活動</h3>
<p>雙馬現紗市塲、昨晨言說紛紜、謂華捕要求增加津貼問題、引起許多閒話、都云金融收解困難、買賣成交之後、手續較艱、大眾贊成不做交易爲妙、由此爭持達九時半以後、未曾切實解決、旋聞外匯開出、金市亦照常營業、二十去雙馬喊聲銷起、做價爲一千二百三十元、成交十包、惟賣者又湧、一跌至一千二百二十三四元、略見成交、以後又復擯持勿動、不久已到十一時、大家一閧而散、所以行情單因成交不多、未曾刊布、香港幫銷有動辦、最後二十支雙馬本日出價爲一千二百二十五元、成交十包、</p>
<p>散市以後、紗布交易所中、因外滙縮〇三一二五、人心大振、二十支雙馬做至一千二百三十五元、一時有買不到之說、但在三時左右、有人賣出、略形回疲一些云、</p>
<p>又棉紗、三十日有九百零九件、運往香港、今（一日）有六百七十件、亦運香港、</p>
<h3>白包火機花　華廠均有需要</h3>
<p>現棉情形稍形開展、因華廠方面、對於白包草包兩種皆有需要、其他依然消沉、所以人心轉佳、惟日廠絕少生氣、同業意態平平、因之行市方面、無大起色也、不過帶堅一步、火機草包價爲二百零六七元、棧交送廠加四元、太倉花二百十四元、又查棉花、今（一日）有八百二十五件運往香港、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初因同業之購買而略漲、後則因華爾街之賣出、及一部份多頭了結、結果收盤價格、近期不動、遠期降落五磅音、印度昨日漲二羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來始終靜寂、各方購意淡薄、俱抱觀望態度、廠方以紗市無起色、月廠中存貨尚敷目前之需要、故暫無交易也、</p>
<h3>雜項　紹酒飛漲　瓶酒二元五角</h3>
<p>紹酒來游、僅能繞道乍浦運到少許、以致上海紹酒存底日薄、囤戶爭相購囤後、市價日趨激漲、封銷前京莊五十斤裝、每　最高售價僅二十二元、封鎖後暗盤未幾即高爲二十四至二十六元、八月一日酒業公會決議改明盤市價爲二十八元算、惟不出一月、暗盤又起漲風、由二十八而十十九·三十、至三十三四元、最近自十二月一日起、酒業公會又改訂明盤市價爲每　三十六元、但同業暗盤漲風更厲、竟超越規定市價、高抬爲三十八至四十元、同時、瓶頭花彫山每瓶高峯價一元八角更漲爲二元五角、至於蘇酒、價　飛漲、數天內已由市價每罐二十一元算、暗盤狂跳至二十六七元云、（雁）</p>
<h3>疋頭　呢絨平淡</h3>
<p>近來呢絨　中　不論批發不剪、市面上　　繁盛、當際上則已減　三分之一、甚至缺少一半、具主要原因、爲近日貨價高漲、買客無形中削弱許多、然呢絨行市、仍緊穩妥不跌、此乃　境與成本及百　貨價之關係耳</p>
<h3>金融述評</h3>
<p>— 聖凱瓊</p>
<p>——十一月三十日——</p>
<p>最近匯市的演變</p>
<p>上海黑市滙價自九月底美國對華貸款二千五百萬美元後，因爲國際局勢的展開、對於中國的抗戰大爲有利，滙價即以九月底爲轉捩期，美金自十月　日的五元半，升爲七日的五元七八，十一日的五元八七五，更躍爲二十八日的六元一五六而自此以後，在十一月九日以前，始終在六元的水準度以上盤旋。十一月十一日因蘇聯莫洛托夫的訪德，行市突自六·〇三降爲五·七八後，但又逐漸上升至六元左右。月底因爲盲目的投機者，在庸人自擾的塲面下，除二十九日見五·七五外，大體則止於五·八一二五。</p>
<p>檢討月底以前的滙市演變情形，深覺得日本的「承認」所及於滙市的影響，遠不如國際局勢演變對於中國利害底力量雄厚。以這　期間的事實證明之，上海特二區法院的被攫奪，在人人心目中認爲滙市要受到打擊的，可是事實上美金所　不過三十二份之一分，而莫洛托夫訪德的消息，却使美滙反常的跌了四份之一分。此後所謂某銀行成立之謠言，雖謠得利害，敵不了美日間難以改善的緊張關係，與夫中美間鉅額新借款的影響，故行市反自五·八七五升爲六元。</p>
<p>知識的人，又中了毒，以爲如此怎樣演下去，法幣又　成問題了。其實正無兼顧　，不看華北的「聯鈔」，華中的軍票，積二年以上的推行，用雙管齊下的壓力，尚且不能打倒法幣，而日本因輸出物資以維持「聯鈔」軍票的價值，已莫名悲喪煩惱，故即使平中再增一種無準備的紙幣，也不算一回事何況成立與否還是一個X</p>
<p>在外滙上投機的人看明白一點。自法國允日本在西貢設立軍事根據地後，日本南　愈見積極，這也就是日本　於英美間的摩擦愈甚，遲早（決不是很遠的）南太平洋上的戰爭要如火山口的爆發，法幣的漲價，決不致因金融界或偶然的新事故，而受有甚麼影響。（未完）</p>

<h3>我對於子女的希望</h3>
<p>— 陸高誼</p>
<p>最近靑年會舉辦了一個少年四育週，結束的那天，並舉行了一個父母子女宴會。在宴會中，父母子女變方都有代表演講，子女方面是講「我對於父母的希望」，本文那是筆者代表父母方面所講的話，也許為讀本刋的小朋友所樂聞。</p>
<p>中國初辦新式學校的時候，常有父子同在一校讀書的專情。據說一天有一對父子彼此不服起來。父親說，「你要知道，你是我生的」。兒子說，「我知道，但你只生我的身，沒有生我的心」。父親聽了有點生氣，就說，「你不能那樣說，若再說，我就打你」。兒子說，「倘使你打我，那我就去吿訴先生」。</p>
<p>我們不問這個故事究竟是眞是假，我捫所要注意的，就是那個兒子的理由的確是勝於父親的理由。</p>
<p>我們做父母的往往有一種成見，以為做子女的總不如我們。其實，有時子女實在是勝於我們，而且也是應該勝於我們，因為必須下一代勝於前一代，這個世界才有進步；否則，人類的智慧只會愈傳愈少，不會愈積愈多。</p>
<p>因此，我對於子女的希望，不希望別的，只希望他們將來能够時時勝於我，處處勝於我。今天是少年四育週的結束會，我希望他們在這次四育週中所得的知識，將來都能發揚光大，平均發展。就中國目前所最需要的情形而論，我希望子女們將來能在德育方面，比我們有更大的同情心；在智育方面，比我們有更專的實用技能；在體育方面，比我們有更吃苦耐分的體力；在羣育方面，比我們有更守紀律的習慣。</p>
<p>我因為講得很簡單，只有一個希望，就是希望小朋友們將來都能勝於各人自己的父母，在四育方面都能達到下一代勝於前一代，希望小朋友們都容易記牢。</p>
<h3>乘電梯的奇蹟</h3>
<p>— 蘇明</p>
<p>在上星期的一天下午，庸兒的母親帶了他們兄弟倆，到大公司裏去辦一些冬季用的東西。到了那裏，才知道要到三層樓始可買到，因此只得乘了電梯，一刹那間，便到了三樓，很快的買好了所要買的東西。在乘電梯下去的時候，被庸兒發現了奇蹟，他悶着不響，直到了家裏，便對他哥哥說：「哥哥，你可曾在電梯下降的時候，發現了什麼奇蹟？」他哥哥聽了這話，好生詫異，電梯中有什麼奇蹟，當然回說他沒有發現過什麼。</p>
<p>「你沒有發現嗎？而我却發現了。當我站在電梯中開始下降的時候，受到一種何等奇異的感覺，只覺得自己的身體是非常輕飄，似乎一個人自由谷上跌到海中去的模樣。當電梯到達地面之後，而目己還沒有感覺到電梯已經停了，身體還幾乎不能立刻踏到地上，因為只覺得自己身體的分量很輕過了一會，這種奇異的感覺才消滅。哥哥，這是什麽道理？你可感覺到嗎？」</p>
<p>原來「這是你少乘電梯的緣故。我在初次乘的時候，也感覺到過，後來便漸漸地成了習慣，倒也不覺得什麼。這個道理，你回得很好。我來吿訴你：當你不動的站在電梯裏，當在電梯下降的時候，便發生速度，你不動的身體界地心吸力的緣故，跟着電梯的下降而下降，而身體的速度當然不及電梯的速度，然而相差是極微的，如果細細地分析，電梯下降的時候，你的身體和電梯一度脫離關係，似乎懸在空中一般，不過和電梯脫離的程度是微乎其微，所以我們覺得身體飄飄然，並且覺得很輕。由此可知凡在下降的一刹那的物體是秤不出它的分量換句話說，下降的物體是沒有重量的，然而到達地面之後，便重新有它本來的重量了。不信，我可試給你看。你去拿一根沒有組細的木棒，棒外兩端放了兩隻同樣重量的盤，一盤裏放了一把烘麵包用的兩脚鐵絲鉗，一鉗脚用繞掛在棒頭上，另一盤裏放了石子，使兩面的重量平衡，於是擦一根火柴把綫燒斷，那上面懸空的一鉗脚就下墜在盤裏。這時平衡的木棒會發生怎樣變化？當懸空的一鉗脚正在下墜的時候？那木棒還依舊保待平衡理。這樣說那木棒便一些兒不動，那也不見得，因為在兩隻鉗脚併合的當兒，多少加上了一些壓力，因此那木棒的平衡便沒有以前的穩固了。不過相差是不很大的。」這一個試騐，做了好一會兒。</p>
<h3>秀蘭鄧波兒自傳（廿四）</h3>
<p>— 民</p>
<p>第二天我們就到了火奴魯魯。當我們在船上遠望時，火奴魯魯好似一　小鳥棲息在天邊的水面上。可是我們的船越駛越近，它也越放越大了。末了兒我就瞧見了沿海岸許多許多的樹木，又瞧見一陣一陣的浪花，衝在海灘雪白的沙上。可甘，到了再近一些時，又來了一個奇怪的現象，見有不少好像是旗子，花朶，衣服，和男女的面龐等等，一大堆的在岸邊，混合着。可甘，你可知道這是甚麼？原來是一大羣的男男女女。可甘，據我猜想起來，一定有甚麼大事情要發生了。</p>
<p>爸爸對我說：「我想岸上要看這一犬羣的人，一定是等候着要瞧這船上那一位搭客吧。」呵呵，可甘，你再也猜想不到，他們所要瞧的，並不是別的人，却就是我啊！</p>
<p>我怎麼知道的呢？因為他門在開始提高了喉嚨，喊我的名字了。我也就在甲板上向他們揮揮手。到得我們的般靠了岸。我走上岸去時，他們更同聲歡呼起來。一張張的臉上，都帶着笑，分明是樂於瞧見我似的。原來他們都已說識我，而我却不認識他們；如今我對着這些不認識的朋友們，不知道說些甚麼話才好，何況人數又是這樣多，眞把我窘住了。</p>
<p>當下我捫一行人，就到總督的府邸裏去。呀，可甘，在那總督府的門前，又有許多朋友在歡迎我，比了碼頭上的一大羣人更來得多！我們進了府邸，在和總督說話的時候，門外還在大聲吶喊，要我出去，和他們相見。我們很感激他們的一番美意，就由媽媽和爸爸牽着我的手，走到門樓上去，下面的羣衆，同聲喊着好來！」他們還要求我唱一個歌。媽媽低聲對我說：「親愛的，你就唱那「好船綠梨浦」歌吧。我知道他們一定聽的。」可甘，這歌兒，我一連被要求唱了四遍，可知他們是何等的愛聽哩！</p>
<h3>追記一位熱血的同學</h3>
<p>— 黃漢生</p>
<p>在過去戰事三年的過程中，不知道喪失了多少的靑年學子；他們都是為着中華民族的復興而殺身成仁。</p>
<p>現在我記的是我們校裏的同學吳鴻煃君，他籍貫是江蘇省如臯縣人，現年二十一歲。民國二十三年春，曾充申報館鑄字部練習生，三年期滿；曾得經理賜予「勤儉樸實」四個字，以資勉勵，這樣可以看到他的個性。</p>
<p>他除職業上的工作外，還在第六中華職業補習學校，補習學業，他的考績常列前茅，為全校師生所欽慕。</p>
<p>平時，他除愛好口琴，簫笛，歌唱，奕棋，乒乓、一類的娛樂外，還主編壁報；曾博得一般讀者的歡迎。同時，接到了警吿。但他並不驚懼，仍冒着危險，不稍轉變。</p>
<p>他的父親在二十七年伙，橫遭槍殺，他驚聞噩耗，幾痛不欲生。今年的夏間，他也不辭別他的慈愛的老母和兩個幼弟弱妹，化名吳光，而棄職從戎了。</p>
<p>據說：他在京滬綫太活躍了，致在前日慘死刀下。這個消息傳到我們校裏，莫不為之痛惜。</p>
<p>十一月八目，有很多的同學，和同志；假××學校追悼這位熱血的同學吳鴻煃，我瞻仰遺容，不禁為之淚下，當時的會塲的秩序，悲壯肅穆。</p>
<p>噫！像這樣的勇於愛國，為父　仇的好靑年，多麽值得我們的敬佩啊。</p>

<h3>故鄕</h3>
<p>— 澄衷小學　葉潤福</p>
<p>每當夜深人靜的時候，我總回憶着我那美麗的故鄕，漸漸的，我已入了夢境。</p>
<p>一輪火傘般的太陽，向西方沉落了好多時。墨黑的天空，漸漸的露出了一輪皎潔的月亮。它放着淡弱的光彩，在代替着太陽的責任。但並沒有太陽那般的暴烈，它柔和地撫着人們。白天在勞苦的人，到了現在，好像早已把勞苦拋到了九霄雲外，各人臉上露出了笑容，在閒談着白天所經歷的事。</p>
<p>這時，我獨自在公園裏徘徊。陣陣微風送來的荷花香，使我抬頭遠望，只見對面小池內的荷花，穿上了一件粉紅色的新衣似的，越發顯得嬌媚動人；旁邊陪襯着碧綠的荷葉，很悠閒地在水面浮動着啊，「啊！這是多麽美麗的一幅圖畫！」我讚歎着。</p>
<p>淸靜，秀麗的環境，圍着我整個的故鄕。我們的屋前，有着許多合抱的大樹，和各種野花，屋的周圍，有好幾座高山；山澗響着「淙淙……」的泉聲，很是幽雅。一處處的桑林和魚塘，都很有秩字的排列着，這是多麽幽美，淸秀？</p>
<p>這些不過是幻想，其實，這淸秀的地方，早已被可怕的戰神所蹂躪了。唉！這是誰的所賜？我醒來的時候，回想着那故鄕的風景，和現在的一比，不禁發出了這樣的一個問題。</p>

<h3>神秘的地毯</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>當我們踏進任何那家電影院的時候，在走廊或沿座位的路上，不是總能看到有地毯舖着的嗎，地毯與電影有什麽關係？各位大都是不知道的，今天我要吿訴你們—地毯受平常的燈光反照時，不論光度是怎樣微弱，如果同時銀慕上正在放映五彩影片，那麽對於我們的視覺方面是絕對不利的；為要補救這個缺點，現在已有了「神秘地毯」“Magic　Carpet”的發明，地毬而名為「神秘」，當然有共與衆不同之處，假使拆穿來講呢，不過是科學的新成功而已。因為仍舊拿普通的地毯，（地毯的染料中含有螢光成份的除外），使其受紫外光綫的反射；換一句話說，就是在影院內部四周裝置能够放紫外光綫的燈；這樣，普通的地毯便能在黑暗中照耀出很柔和的各種不同的顏色，而上面所說的缺點亦就可以免除。地毯的改進，與電影本身有直接的影響，影迷們的意料中大槪是不會猜到的吧！</p>
<h3>中國卡通社籌攝　五彩卡通片　老笨狗餓肚記將與影迷相見</h3>
<p>自從華德狄斯耐的「白雪公主」問世，卡通片在藝壇上，已經奠定了穩固的基礙，因為這種影片，非但達到藝術至高的效果，而且負有敎育的使命，極能影響到－般觀衆尤其婦孺之類的思想。卡通畫在我國，因為種種物質條件的不够，所以一時刻在電影市塲揷上一足，直到最近，很可喜的，已有中國卡通社以獨立的姿態出現了。</p>
<p>關於中國卡通社，他們的前期就是學生卡通社，是一般富有藝術修養的靑年們組織的，後來預備擴大範圍，才改名中國卡通社了。第一部處女作「老笨狗餓肚記」，經過三度的修改，現在方吿完竣，目下正在接洽放映的地點，等到時機成熟，便可與我們相見了。</p>
<p>最近，他們正在進行第二部的作品，並且決定一個偉大的計畫，就是在第二部作品上，預備攝製成五彩片。雖然，五彩的卡通片，在我們並不感到驚異的，不過那是限於國外的出品，在我國的影史中，至少是珍貴的一頁呢！（稜白）</p>

<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第十二章　報吿和解釋</p>
<p>「我說過了，金錢是主因，婚姻是次因。因着上夜裏守琦的魯莽行動，這件事情已經弄僵。麗蘭雖曾建議用金錢解除婚約，經過了守琦的行勁，這建議勢必也不能履行。結果就是人財兩空。這當然是李芝範所不願意的。於是謀殺的念頭，就在這老人心裏活動了。」</p>
<p>「你們總瞧見這老人的一雙黑眼奕奕有神，顯示他是具有相當魄力的。他既然有了行兇的意念，又得到湊巧的機緣，他的謀殺的決心就完全成立了。」</p>
<p>倪金壽問道：「你說的機緣，可是指這老頭兒到上海的那天，曾目睹余甘棠與趙伯雄互相爭吵的一回事嗎？」</p>
<p>霍桑點點頭道：「是的，這是一個遠因；近因是昨天早晨他送了兒子上火車回來，又聽得麗蘭跟余甘棠在電話中相駡。余甘棠所說的恫嚇的說話，老人一定都聽得。因為老毛曾說，那時候就是李芝範勸麗蘭上樓去的。他覺得麗蘭的環境既然這樣複雜，他自己是個鄕下人，造成了這件案子，人家決不會疑心到他。因此他就毅然決然的就在當天夜裏下這毒手。」</p>
<p>倪金壽連連點着頭，認為霍桑的假定很合情理。他又說道：「霍先生，他行兇的經過，你索性也說一說罷。」</p>
<p>霍桑還沒有答話，電鈴響了。倪金壽接了話筒一聽，又簡短地答了幾句，就將話筒擱好。他的險色也沉了下來。</p>
<p>他說道：「完了。這是公安醫院徐院長來的電話這老頭兒已經完了。」</p>
<p>霍桑低低地嘆了一口氣。「他如果耐得住淸苦的敎讀生活，不受物質的誘惑，此刻也許還安安逸逸地度着鄕村生活呢！」連接着又是一聲嘆息。（一八二）</p>

<h3>US Treasury Secretary to Announce Support for Chinese Currency Credit; US to Use Equalization Fund Under New Plan; Senate Banking Committee Approval Expected Soon</h3>
<p>Washington - Treasury Secretary Morgenthau is expected to appear before the Senate Banking Committee on Monday to request approval for a plan to use a portion of the US Equalization Fund to support Chinese credit. According to a prominent member of the committee, the plan is expected to be approved quickly, as the fund has not been used since the outbreak of the European war. The only question is the amount. The Chinese government believes that a US announcement of willingness to support its currency will have an incredible effect on the market. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Washington - Former Chinese Finance Minister and current Chairman of the Bank of China, Song Ziwen, visited US Export-Import Bank President Pierson yesterday to discuss the issue of continued US loans to China. Song told reporters afterwards that no decisions were reached during the meeting, but he said the talks were "useful." Well-informed sources believe that the loan issue is unlikely to be resolved immediately. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<p>Honolulu - Song Ziwen recently discussed economic aid to China with US officials in the United States. His brother, Song Ziliang, General Manager of the Southwest Transportation Company, arrived here yesterday on the "Clipper" mail ship. Accompanying him was the well-known Chinese banker Mr. Liu. It is said that Song Ziliang will go to the United States to jointly negotiate with his brother. It is reported that although the Japanese are attempting to bomb the Lancang River Bridge, cargo transportation on the Burma Road continues uninterrupted. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Meets with Chinese Ambassador Guo to Discuss Economic Aid to China</p>
<p>London - Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi held talks with British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax yesterday to discuss the issue of British economic aid to China. The talks did not address the content of the Japanese-Wang "Agreement." This indicates that in the minds of the British, Chongqing is the capital of China, and all British relations with China will be limited to contact with General Chiang Kai-shek. Well-informed sources further stated that British policy is to avoid interfering in conflicts between France and Thailand. It is also rumored in the United States that new credit loans will be granted to China, so efforts are being made to have Britain cooperate with the United States to aid China. Although negotiations are in the preliminary stages, they are reportedly planning to loan China money to help stabilize the legal tender and enable China to purchase foreign supplies, especially important military raw materials. According to reliable sources, of the £3 million loaned to China by Britain in 1939, £2.5 million was earmarked for the purchase of British goods. However, due to Britain's own war needs, there may be delays in delivery. Chinese sources here claim that Soviet aid to China has recently decreased significantly. The reason is attributed to reduced Soviet production, but as the Soviet Union has now restored its production rate, its shipments to China should return to normal. It is reported that the Soviet Union is preparing to use the Siberian Railway to transport supplies to China. Chinese diplomatic circles claim that they have confirmed that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov avoided discussing Far Eastern issues in Berlin. Meanwhile, Soviet sources here claim that economic and political negotiations between Japan and the Soviet Union are progressing slowly. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<h3>Franco-Japanese Economic Negotiations to be Held in Tokyo</h3>
<p>Hanoi - Franco-Japanese economic negotiations will be held in Tokyo soon. French and Vietnamese representatives have been dispatched. The Vietnamese delegation left for Saigon today to join other representatives and travel by ship to Kobe, Japan. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The "Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun" today's editorial argues that the Japanese government should quickly conclude the Japanese-Vietnamese trade talks scheduled to begin in Tokyo in late December. It claims that the Japanese-Vietnamese trade agreement must be based on the principles of building a new order in East Asia, with Vietnam as an important member. The newspaper also urges the government to resume trade negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies as soon as possible, and to send a special envoy to the Dutch East Indies to replace Mr. Kobayashi, the Japanese businessman who recently returned from Batavia. The newspaper further states that the government should upgrade the Japanese legation in Thailand to an embassy as soon as possible. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Mr. Matsumiya, head of the Japanese economic mission to French Vietnam, is expected to fly back here from Taipei this afternoon. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Commercial Negotiations with the Dutch East Indies Have Failed</h3>
<p>Washington - It is reported that the results of the Japanese trade mission to the Dutch East Indies have effectively failed. After some diplomatic delays, Japan has only satisfied one-third of its oil requests. Its request for high-grade fuel has been completely rejected. Japan must pay in foreign currency and use its own oil tankers. Japan's second trade offensive in Batavia will likely focus on tin first and then rubber. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Kenkichi Yoshizawa, who served as Foreign Minister during the Inukai Cabinet, has been appointed as the chief Japanese representative to the Dutch East Indies to succeed Kobayashi. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<h3>Investigation Continues into Arrest of Vietnamese Financial Policy Advisor</h3>
<p>Hanoi - Hanoi police continued their investigation today into the arrest of Vietnamese financial advisor Gassot on the 20th. He is accused of "endangering national security through political actions." (United Press, 30th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Repelled on Both Banks of the Han River; Chinese Troops Recapture Lixi Salt Pond Temple; Japanese Troops North of Jingmen to be Cleared Within Days; Japanese Troops South of the Xianghua Road Have Retreated to Shazigang</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Chinese sources say that after the Chinese army's counter-offensive on November 28, the Japanese offensive on both banks of the Han River has been repelled. It is reported that the entire Japanese line was breached yesterday, and the Chinese army is now attacking on all fronts. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Fancheng - After six days of counterattacks by the Japanese army in northern and central Hubei, all fronts have collapsed. After the recovery of Lishan and Jingmingpu on the Xianghua Road, the Chinese army is pursuing the enemy, driving them to a narrow area at the foot of the Dahong Mountains. The Japanese who attacked north along the Jingzhong Road, including those who attacked the Changshoudian and Majiaji areas, were defeated by the Chinese on the 28th and fled south. Those who attacked south of Zhangjiaji also retreated due to the Chinese pincer attack. On the 28th, the Chinese army recaptured Xianju in one fell swoop, and then recaptured Lixi and Yanchi Temple. Currently, the Chinese are continuing to pursue the Japanese. The Japanese north of Jingmen can be completely cleared within days. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Fancheng - More than 10,000 Japanese infantry and cavalry, supported by 20 artillery pieces and more than 10 aircraft, fought fiercely with the Chinese army on the 27th and 28th in the Xianju and Zengjiawan areas west of the Xiang River. The Chinese army launched several short-range attacks against the Japanese, and finally completely defeated the Japanese. On the 29th, the Chinese took advantage of the victory to pursue the enemy and recaptured the key points of Lixi and Yanchi Temple (both north of Jingmen) in one fell swoop. In addition to capturing countless military supplies, the Chinese also captured many Japanese soldiers. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Fancheng - The Japanese troops south of the Xianghua Road were driven by the Chinese to the Shazigang area on the 29th. At the same time, the Chinese have formed a ring of fire around them and are carrying out annihilation operations. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Fancheng - On the 28th, thousands of Japanese troops with several artillery pieces attacked Jinniuling south of Yu'an, while more than 1,000 Japanese troops with several artillery pieces attacked Bailihe. After the Chinese army divided its forces to intercept, the Japanese were wounded and retreated. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Officials Say They Still Recognize the National Government</h3>
<p>London - Responsible sources here commented on Japan's formal recognition of Nanjing as the "National Government of China," saying that the British government's position is very clear. The British government will continue to recognize the government led by General Chiang Kai-shek as the National Government of China. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Huai'an Fail in Southern Advance</h3>
<p>A Certain Place in Northern Jiangsu - More than 300 Japanese troops from Huai'an in northern Jiangsu attacked the area near Erchudong south of Huai'an on the 21st. The Chinese army fiercely intercepted them, and the Japanese were unable to withstand the attack and retreated. On the 25th, more than 300 Japanese troops from Baoying attacked the positions near Liujiaqiao and Baxianpu north of Baoying in two routes. The Chinese army met them head-on, and fierce fighting is still underway. (30th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Officer Assassinated in Peiping</h3>
<p>Peiping - The Chinese people, especially those living near the Japanese military headquarters, continue to be very frightened today because a Japanese lieutenant colonel was killed by a Chinese man yesterday. They fear that the Japanese will take strong measures. Because of the assassination, the Japanese closed all four city gates and conducted searches in order to find the assailant. It is generally expected that food prices will increase greatly. It is reported that the assassin escaped on a bicycle. The Japanese lieutenant colonel was shot around noon yesterday. After the incident, the Japanese immediately closed all city gates and searched the people at the scene. This incident is the first case of a Japanese officer being killed in Peiping.

<h3>US and Soviet Union Improve Commercial Relations; Diplomatic Talks Continue to Make Progress; Soviet Union Agrees to Allow US to Establish Consulate in Vladivostok</h3>
<p>Washington - Assistant Secretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that his conversation with Soviet Ambassador to the United States Oumansky on Wednesday was very friendly and constructive. He hopes to continue diplomatic talks with the Soviet Union, and he expects that commercial relations between the two countries will improve as a result. The purpose of the talks is to eliminate various problems that cause friction in economic and commercial relations. The result of the talks so far is that the Soviet Union is willing to allow the United States to establish a US consulate in Vladivostok. When asked by reporters whether the establishment of the US consulate in Vladivostok was in preparation for increased trade with the Soviet Union, Welles replied yes. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<h3>Corpses Litter the Hong Kong-Guangdong Highway</h3>
<p>Hong Kong - Corpses of soldiers, coolies, travelers, and animals are scattered all over the main road from Shaoguan to Shark Bay in Daya Bay, 25 miles northeast of Hong Kong. The sick on the road have difficulty getting medical treatment, especially in the section from Shark Bay to Danshui, because transportation in this section relies solely on walking. Travelers returning to Hong Kong from the mainland say that there are considerable movements of Chinese troops along the Dong River, from Huizhou up to Heyuan and Laolong. This movement is clearly a precautionary measure taken by the Chinese army due to the Japanese forces moving from Guizhou and Guangdong. Some of the sick soldiers die en route, while others are carried on stretchers. The most deaths are among the coolies, who often fall ill due to overwork or drinking unclean water. There are many animal carcasses in the Dong River, all of which died on the road and were thrown into the river. The high mortality rate is largely due to the unsanitary conditions along the way and poor road management. The road from Huizhou has been destroyed to prevent Japanese invasion, so those traveling this road must walk or ride in sedan chairs. Even mountain carts cannot travel from Danshui to the coast. The highway from Daya Bay to Shaoguan is crowded with goods being transported inland, mostly cotton yarn and flour. There are far fewer goods being exported than imported, mostly tung oil and tungsten. Travelers and coolies have to be vigilant themselves because there are no convoys or even security guards along the way. A road maintenance fund of 500,000 yuan has been allocated, but after learning about the current state of this trunk road, the Guangdong Provincial Government will urgently provide protection and medical assistance to travelers going inland. The final section of the road is in Bao'an County, and the county magistrate has been ordered to improve road management. (International News Service, 30th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Ineffective "Offensive"</h3>
<p>In the world of war, there are often novel and strange offensives constantly being staged. Among them, the most familiar to the world is the military offensive on the surface, but at the same time, there are also so-called political and diplomatic offensives.</p>
<p>The political offensive may proceed simultaneously with the military offensive, or it may be before or after. Its main tactic is to cultivate a reactionary force within the target country to serve as an internal response. For example, Germany's cultivation of Inquart before its seizure of Austria, its support for the Sudeten German Party during its encroachment on Czechoslovakia, and later its sheltering of the "Quisling government" when attacking Norway, and the use of the Fifth Column when attacking the Netherlands and Belgium, are all prominent facts.</p>
<p>The diplomatic offensive is also an important strategy used before or during the war to assist the military. For example, in August last year, before invading Poland, Germany first signed a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union to avoid worries about the east. In June of this year, when Hitler's troops were about to reach the walls of Paris, he encouraged Italy to officially participate in the war in order to achieve a devastating effect. This is a masterpiece of a successful diplomatic offensive.</p>
<p>As for the military offensive, it is nothing more than relying on strategy and the true strength of soldiers and equipment to take actual action. In the past, Germany used blitzkrieg tactics to successively take Poland, Norway, and the three Western European countries, which was indeed a great achievement of military offensive. Even the bloodless occupation of Austria and Czechoslovakia was, in a small way, also based on the superior military strength of the Nazi government.</p>
<p>For all offensives, success and failure each account for half. If they can be used properly, it is not difficult to achieve results. The above examples are all more prominent because of their success. There are countless others that have been submerged and unknown. However, they also reveal a common performance, that is, they contain a consistent host-guest relationship. In other words, all offensives must be based on military force as the main body in order to be handy. Conversely, if there is no real and substantial combat power as a backing, then no matter whether it is a political offensive or a diplomatic offensive, the result will not only be nothing, but often "drawing a tiger and failing to resemble it, instead resembling a dog," only exposing one's own ugliness.</p>
<p>For example: (1) In February of this year, when the Soviet Union used troops in Finland, it also cultivated a so-called "Kuusinen government." This was a kind of political offensive, but it failed in the end because the military was unable to achieve any success after a long battle. Fortunately, the Moscow authorities were good at using it, able to send and receive freely. Later, on the day when they signed a peace treaty with the legitimate government of Finland, this unnatural organization disappeared. (2) In September of this year, Hitler wanted to strike first in the Balkans. Therefore, he first set his sights on the Iron Guard in Romania, cultivating it and encouraging it, and finally brewing a scene of forcing the palace, a "coup d'état." This can naturally be regarded as a kind of political offensive. However, in recent days, just when the Romanian Prime Minister went to Berlin to sign a treaty, the Iron Guard, which had been cultivated, took the opportunity to brazenly stage a "great revenge," causing chaos and panic throughout the city, which was outrageous. At this time, if Germany took over and directly used force to suppress it, it would probably further arouse the anger of the pro-British elements in Romania (most of the 64 political leaders who were killed by the Iron Guard were military and political authorities who had presided over pro-British policies in the past), and the Red Army, which is now eyeing the Bessarabia region and the Black Sea, seems unlikely to stand idly by. Therefore, in the future, Romania will probably not only not be able to help the Axis powers in the short term, but will instead become a burden. This is probably the first failure of Hitler to continue with military victory after launching a political offensive.</p>
<p>The above are failures of political offensives. Now, please cite two recent examples of failed diplomatic offensives: (1) On September 27 of this year, Germany, Italy, and Japan formed a tripartite alliance treaty. This was a diplomatic offensive with considerable momentum, but as a result, Germany and Italy have failed to achieve anything in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, and Japan dares not act rashly in the Pacific. Even in the realistic environment of the strengthened attitude of the United States and the persistent policy of the Soviet Union, the three major allies have increasingly had the appearance of sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams, seeming to be united but actually disunited. Therefore, this offensive is gradually becoming a laughing stock in modern diplomatic history. (2) Between the 20th and 24th of this month, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia successively joined the tripartite alliance. This is certainly another diplomatic offensive by Hitler, who was impatient with the protracted Greek war and eager to thoroughly intervene in the Balkans. His original intention was certainly to use this chain to force Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, which might allow passage, to follow in the footsteps of the Hungarian and Romanian countries. Unfortunately, this offensive was aborted due to the successive defeats of the Black Shirts. At this time, Bulgaria has clearly stated that it is unwilling to join the alliance, and the attitude of the South has also changed considerably. Even the true intentions of the Soviet Union and Turkey are not difficult to see. Therefore, in the past few days, it has only been heard that the German ambassador to Turkey has assured the Turkish government that he is unwilling to participate in the Balkan war, and there have been no reports of Nazi troops driving straight into Southeast Europe. This historical fact seems to further illustrate that a diplomatic offensive that is not accompanied by military victory is also bound to fail. Why is this so? As a result of knowing oneself and knowing the enemy, all bluffing becomes ineffective.</p>
<p>In short, all political or diplomatic offensives, if they can only be accompanied by music with messages such as "shifting new positions" or "automatic withdrawal," and cannot be followed by actual and rapid military achievements, then no matter how vast the offensive is, it is still bound to be a "dampened firecracker."</p>
<h3>Japan Applies Pressure on Thailand from Vietnam; Thai Troops Concentrated on Vietnamese Border; Britain and Thailand Have Signed an Agreement; Thailand Especially Supplies Rice to Singapore; Part of Thai Troops Invade Vietnamese Territory</h3>
<p>Chongqing - According to reliable sources received here, Japan is currently applying pressure on Thailand from Vietnam, so the Vietnamese authorities are taking a very firm attitude towards Thailand. It is reported that Thailand is now concentrating troops on the Vietnamese border to prepare for contingencies. It is also reported that relations between Britain and Thailand have become closer than before, and the two sides have signed an agreement. Thailand has agreed to supply rice to Singapore. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Bangkok - The Thai High Command recently stated that several Thai aircraft have bombed several military points in Thai Khe and Savannakhet in Vietnam. All aircraft returned safely. It also stated that French artillery also fired from Thai Khe across the Mekong River yesterday. It is also reported that the Thai Iron Blood Corps held a demonstration yesterday to express support for the Thai government in Bangkok. Thousands of people participated in the demonstration. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - According to Japanese sources in Bangkok, the Thai military commander has ordered French nationals in the border provinces to evacuate within 24 hours in order to prevent the tense situation on the Thai-Vietnamese border from becoming more serious. The Vietnamese border has been sealed off, and all traffic has been cut off. At the same time, Thailand has called up reservists and is rapidly expanding its army. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - Japanese sources here say that the Thai Supreme Command has issued a statement calling up reservists due to the tense situation between Thailand and Vietnam. Mobilization is now underway throughout Thailand. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<p>Bangkok - The Thai High Command recently stated that Thai troops entered border areas near Aranyaprathet yesterday and occupied three places in Vietnam. There was tense machine gun fighting on the banks of the Mekong River in Lakon Phalan last night and this morning. There were no Thai casualties, but many French casualties. Two French aircraft flew into Thai territory, and French anti-aircraft guns fired at Thai aircraft traveling in the Thai sky, but none of the Thai aircraft were hit. This afternoon, Thai fighter planes patrolled over Bangkok. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<p>Hanoi - The tense situation between Vietnam and Thailand became more complicated yesterday due to the destruction of the Lang Son-Hanoi railway tracks by rebellious natives. This is the second destruction in a few days. This incident hindered the Japanese train heading south and the train carrying French foreign legion troops heading north. Officials condemned the riots of the natives, which were encouraged by "Communist revolutionaries and pirates." There were no incidents on the border yesterday, but French authorities told the United Press that Thailand's re-bombing will be retaliated against. Authoritative circles claim that the Thai-Vietnamese war will be fought on at least six battlefields, namely forests, swamps, and mountain passes. The border between the two countries is more than 1,000 miles long, but there are only a few roads. As of now, the fighting has been limited to several contacts. The bombing on Thursday was the most intense of the war. Thailand's attack on Laos will encounter enemy artillery fire when crossing the Mekong River, and the attack on Cambodia will encounter resistance from the Cambodian regular army led by French officers. Border travelers reported that the French had installed artillery positions and bunkers to resist tanks in the past few months. General Martin, the retiring commander of the French army in Vietnam, and his subordinates are currently in Vietnam directing colonial infantry, native troops, and foreign troops. According to reliable sources, the French air force is weaker than that of Thailand and has recently concentrated its warplanes for defense. It is generally believed that places such as Bangkok and Saigon are likely to be subjected to air raids. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<p>Vietnam - Officials here recently declared that disputes have occurred frequently on the border between Vietnam and Thailand recently, and the Vietnamese border has also been violated. The responsibility should be borne entirely by the Thai side. Yesterday, several aircraft from that country dropped three bombs in Savannakhet in Vietnam, Cambodia, and one in Thai Khe. Three native soldiers and civilians were killed, and some were injured. This expression of hostility is probably due to the nervousness of junior officers in the Thai army. Upon hearing the news, Lieutenant General Decoux, the Governor-General of Vietnam, immediately telegraphed French Minister to Thailand Garreau for contact in order to resolve this serious dispute, and took appropriate measures to cope with this new situation. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>Bangkok - Thai Prime Minister Songgram recently declared that he personally ordered Thai aircraft to bomb Vietnam in retaliation for the French air raid on Lakon Phalan. Songgram denied the Saigon report that Thailand took the initiative in bombing Vietnam. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<p>Hanoi - The Vietnamese government told United Press reporters that Thai aircraft flew to Savannakhet, a Thai-Vietnamese border town that was bombed the day before yesterday, and distributed leaflets. Apart from this, the border has been quiet for the past two days. Although Thai expatriates are continuing to leave Vietnam, officials say that the situation has not become more serious, but has not improved. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<p>Bangkok - French Minister to Thailand Garreau has warned French expatriates in Thailand to prepare for emergencies. The total number of French expatriates leaving Thailand is less than 50. The French embassy announced that French consular officer Thongkomber was arrested by the police in Bisu Rak, in northern Thailand, while traveling by train to Bangkok. In addition, six French priests and two nuns were also arrested and taken to Bangkok yesterday, but were soon released. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<h3>Chongqing Rice Prices Gradually Declining</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The price of rice in this city had been continuously increasing due to transportation difficulties and hoarding in recent days. The government authorities have imposed strict controls, and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek has also issued instructions. Rice prices have already decreased. Ordinary rice has fallen from 130 yuan per *dan* to 93 yuan per *dan*, and superior rice has fallen from 156 yuan per *dan* to 145 yuan per *dan*. It is expected that rice prices will continue to decline in the coming weeks. Speculators who continue to hoard will be severely punished. Chongqing will begin implementing a rationing system from tomorrow, allowing government employees and the poor to purchase rice at fixed prices. In the future, with the assistance of the National Food Administration, all residents of the city will be able to implement a rationing system for purchasing rice. (Haitong Press, 30th)</p>

<p>Albanian Front: Greek Soldiers Score Successive Victories; Occupy New Positions North of Konitsa; Italian Counterattacks Ineffective, Adopt Defensive Posture</p>
<p>Athens: A communiqué from the Greek High Command stated that as Greek soldiers launched a fierce attack on the heavily forested plateau and achieved an important victory in the Battle of Argyrokastron, Greek forces at other points on the front also occupied several new positions within Albanian territory, most notably the victory north of Konitsa. The Greek forces captured two cannons and many automatic rifles when the Italian soldiers were captured. The Greek Air Force is also continuing to scout the Italian lines. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<p>Rome: Reliable sources claim that the Italian forces have stemmed the Greek advance on all fronts. After a bloody hand-to-hand battle at Argyrokastron, the Italian forces have been able to dig trenches and fortifications there and build barbed wire in front of the trenches to defend the position. It is reported that the Italian forces also occupy strong stone-built fortresses in several places and use heavy artillery to fire on Greek forces. The Italian forces on the right wing of the Korçë area and the left wing of Konitsa are also holding firm. It is claimed that Italian aircraft are very active on all three fronts with great success, with as many as 300 Italian aircraft participating on one day. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<p>Rome: An Italian communiqué acknowledged that the Italian forces on the Greek front are now adopting a defensive posture, stating that the Italian forces are resisting enemy counterattacks and conducting local counterattacks in some areas. Italian aircraft bombed and strafed Greek positions with considerable success. In air combat on November 27th, three British Gloster Gladiator fighter planes and one Bristol Blenheim bomber were shot down. Three Italian aircraft are missing. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Athens: News from here claims that Greek soldiers launched a sudden attack on a certain forested plateau yesterday, achieving a major victory in the battle for Argyrokastron. The city of Argyrokastron has already fallen into Greek hands, but Italian troops are desperately resisting on the forested plateau above the city. The news claims that the Greek army launched an attack at night, occupying the position after six hours of fierce fighting. Yesterday afternoon, Italian forces conducted defensive warfare on both lines in Epirus, and new reinforcements from Italy rushed to the front. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<p>Rome: Reports from American news agencies that Greek forces have captured the Italian naval port south of Argyrokastron and that Italian forces have retreated behind the Devol River have been denied by responsible authorities here. (Haitong Press, 30th)</p>
<p>Southern Capital: According to news from the Albanian border, the Italian-Greek war was very fierce yesterday, with the area north of Pogradec being the center of intense fighting. Artillery fire has not stopped for two days. It is claimed that Greek forces have crossed the Devoll River and occupied villages near Pogradec, but Italian aircraft immediately bombed them, causing fires. Greek reinforcements attempting to advance on Pogradec from the Devoll River have been repelled and suffered heavy losses. It is difficult for Greek reinforcements to arrive because bombing aircraft are bombing the transportation lines. Italian aircraft bombed Florina, Korçë, and Kastoria. White smoke rose near Florina, probably because a Greek fuel depot was hit and caught fire. (Haitong Press, 30th)</p>
<p>Budapest: The Greek radio station yesterday reviewed the fighting since the 23rd, claiming that Greek forces had defeated an Italian counterattack in the central Epirus front. The broadcast claimed that Greek forces shattered the Italian attempt to recover lost ground and pushed the Italian forces back in several places. It further claimed that British and Greek aircraft had bombed Durazzo and other Italian bases in Albania. The radio station concluded that the situation for the Greek forces across the entire front was very favorable. (United Press, 30th)</p>

The British Air Force has actively assisted the Greek forces in combat over the past two days. On Wednesday and Thursday, British aircraft shot down ten Italian aircraft. According to a British Air Ministry communiqué last night, British bombers attacked the Italian troop embarkation port of Santi Quaranta on the Albanian coast. Ships in the port were attacked, and the docks were hit and exploded. Durazzo, a port north of Albania, and Elbasan, another port, were both fiercely attacked by British aircraft. It is noted that Elbasan is the base used by Italian infantry to support the Italian forces attempting to counterattack in the Pogradec area north of Korçë. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Athens: According to a Greek military report, a squadron of Italian destroyers shelled Oea yesterday, but once Greek aircraft appeared overhead, the ships used smoke screens to retreat. A statement from the Royal Air Force claimed that British aircraft destroyed ten enemy aircraft on Thursday and Friday. A small patrol of British aircraft encountered twenty Italian fighter aircraft in southeastern Albania on Thursday and engaged in fierce fighting, shooting down seven Italian aircraft within one minute.

<p>Italian Commander-in-Chief in Greece, Soddu, Promoted to General</p>
<p>Rome: According to an official announcement here, General Soddu, Commander-in-Chief of the Italian forces in Albania, has been promoted to Army General and retains his current position. General Guicciardini has been appointed Chief of Staff and Undersecretary of the Army, succeeding Soddu. General Soddu was born on April 12, 1877, in Maddaloni. In 1939, he served as commander of the Italian forces dispatched to Albania and commander of the garrison in Albania from June to December of the same year. He later commanded the Fourth Army Corps in the Italian Western Front. (Haitong Press, 30th)</p>
<p>Rome: Reports from British sources that Italian Commander General Soddu had resigned and that General Badoglio had gone to Tirana to reorganize the General Staff were also denied, stating that the above news was purely fabricated. General Soddu remains in command of the troops in Albania, and General Badoglio is not in Albania either. (Haitong Press, 30th)</p>

<h3>British Air Raids Target Italian Bases</h3>
<p>London: Malta was the location that paid a considerable price for the enemy aircraft's large activities on Thursday. Although bombs were dropped, there was no damage, but two aircraft were shot down and two others were heavily damaged and may not be able to fly back to their base. British aircraft suffered no damage. According to a communiqué last night by the Air Ministry, the British Air Force in the Western Sahara attacked a small enemy column south of Sidi Barrani, destroying its motorized transport vehicles, killing many drivers, and neutralizing the anti-aircraft guns. Asab, a Red Sea port, was attacked again by British aircraft. Bombs landed in the port next to a large ship equipped with anti-aircraft guns. British aircraft also conducted reconnaissance flights elsewhere. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>London: The London naval community stated that the damage suffered by the Italian navy in the Mediterranean on Sunday indicates that the British navy there is ready for combat at any time, but the British navy is not neglecting its greatest mission in history, namely: (1) suppressing the threat of invasion against Britain, (2) bringing the war deep into enemy territory, and (3) escorting the transport of military supplies.

<h3>Deserts Also Exist on Mars, Soviet Astronomers Prove</h3>
<p>Moscow: The results of Soviet astronomers' observations of Mars have recently been published, confirming that the pigments and luminosity of Mars are identical to those of the red desert sand on Earth. This leads us to believe that the continents on Mars also have deserts, just like our Earth. Soviet astronomers have taken hundreds of photographs of Mars, proving that the atmospheric pressure on Mars is extremely turbulent. Furthermore, a comparison of photographs of Mars taken last year with those taken in 1909 and 1924 shows that there have been some changes. The boundaries of the dark spots on Mars differ by several kilometers each year. (TASS, 29th)</p>

<h3>Nazi Aircraft Groups Attack Britain All Night; London Suffers Cruel Bombing; Incendiary Bombs Fall Like Rain, Firelight Illumines the Sky; Moans and Cries Are Heartrending</h3>
<p>Swedish Capital: London Radio revealed this morning that German aircraft groups bombed London in a concentrated attack lasting seven hours last night, with fires breaking out in many places and a large number of casualties. German aircraft also bombed eastern England, with similar bombings in the Midlands and Liverpool. (Haitong Press, 30th)</p>
<p>Berlin: A Haitong Press reporter learned that several hundred German aircraft bombed military targets in London and its surrounding areas last night, dropping 400 tons of bombs and 36 tons of incendiary bombs. Fires broke out in many places. Italian aircraft bombed railways and docks in Ipswich. (Haitong Press, 30th)</p>
<p>London: From last night until this morning, Nazi aircraft groups once again indiscriminately dropped incendiary bombs on London, turning many parts of the British capital into rubble and ash. However, the Germans' desire to turn the entire British capital into scorched earth has not yet been fulfilled. The fires caused by the incendiary bombs were mostly extinguished by brave and agile firefighters. Therefore, although there were losses, the situation did not become extremely tragic. Last night, German aircraft conducted widespread bombing, with London again bearing the brunt of the attack. The damage was concentrated in the hours before midnight. Before the firefighters and volunteers began extinguishing the fires, the firelight in London illuminated the sky for several hours. Observers estimate that the Germans dropped more incendiary bombs on London last night than on any previous occasion, and it is expected that the number of dead and wounded will be extremely high, as many people are believed to be buried in the rubble. Rescue teams disregarded their own safety during the air raids, digging through the rubble to rescue those trapped inside. Bombs continued to fall overhead while the rescuers worked, and anti-aircraft shells fell like snowflakes, but they ignored everything and were not afraid. Some people believe that last night's large-scale German attack on London was intended to test the British capital's defenses, as the Germans speculated that the British anti-aircraft batteries had shifted their forces to defend cities in the provinces such as Birmingham, Liverpool, and Southampton, which had recently suffered devastating bombings. However, last night the Germans learned that London's anti-aircraft batteries were not only as strong as ever but also fiercer and more accurate than before. From the start of the air raid, anti-aircraft guns fired wildly into the sky until the German aircraft turned around and flew back to their bases after midnight. The German aircraft suddenly rushed into the skies over London about every thirty seconds after the first alert was issued, and their activity did not stop until after midnight. When they began their fierce attack, they dropped countless incendiary and flare bombs, and the anti-aircraft fire was also quite effective. The first batch of German aircraft caused numerous large fires in a certain area of London, after which a second wave of attackers dropped powerful bombs on the burning areas in an attempt to completely destroy the district. However, the fire had already been extinguished before the third wave of attackers arrived. A large hotel in an area of London was threatened by incendiary bombs last night and temporarily suspended its dancing. It is reported that a large area of London suffered considerable damage and casualties, with most of those bombed being private residences. It is feared that countless people have perished within them. A certain hospital in London was bombed last night, and the hospital's maternity ward was damaged. German aircraft also bombed Dover for an hour and a half this morning. According to the Air Ministry, five German aircraft attacking Britain were shot down, and two British airmen are also missing. After the cruel bombing ended, London immediately fell silent. The all-clear was given at 2:00 AM, earlier than usual. After the anti-aircraft fire stopped, the cries of the wounded, the moans of the dying, and the voices of the rescuers directing the work could all be heard. The exact number of victims cannot be ascertained for the time being, but it is believed that the number of casualties must be large. In Liverpool, after two days of air raids, rescue workers have recovered many dead and barely alive people from the accumulated rubble. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<h3>British Air Force Conducts Long-Range Raids for Days; Attacks German Industrial Centers; Stettin Turned into a Large Fire Pit; Shipyards and Oil Refineries Heavily Damaged</h3>
<p>London: Stettin, an important industrial center in Germany, became Berlin's sea outlet after the Berlin-Stettin Canal was opened in 1914. It was bombed by British aircraft on Thursday night with unprecedented intensity, causing fires to break out everywhere and turning it into a large fire pit. According to the Air Ministry's intelligence office, the British aircraft flew 1,300 miles round trip to attack the city. The first bomb dropped immediately caused a large fire and subsequent explosions. Other British aircraft arrived in succession and dropped bombs. One observer reported seeing at least 20 large fires. Another observer said that the bombs dropped by his aircraft also caused eight fires. The illumination from the flares dropped by British aircraft and the flashes from the ground explosions illuminated the area like daylight, and the broken walls and ruins were clearly visible. The Stettin artificial oil refinery, which produces over one million gallons of motor oil annually, was heavily damaged by a British air raid about six weeks ago, with severe internal damage and four chimneys collapsing. The Germans had already rushed to repair it, but it was bombed again by British aircraft on Thursday night, which will surely discourage the Germans. The shipyards in Stettin were also bombed, especially the shipyards at the mouth of the Oder River that build warships and submarines. British pilots reported inflicting heavy damage on the shipyards, with buildings collapsing with a loud crash. British aircraft that arrived later saw the center of the target area on fire. British aircraft also bombed the Mannham factory, which manufactures submarine engines, causing explosions and fires, dealing a blow to the German navy. Other targets included the Düsseldorf armaments factory and the railway sidings and freight yards in Coblenz, as well as the bridges and road and rail junctions on both sides of the Rhine River, all of which were bombed by British aircraft. On Thursday night, other British aircraft flew to attack enemy docks and ships in a wide area between the ports of Cuxhaven and Hamburg. Boulogne was bombed and caught fire. When British aircraft attacked Antwerp, one aircraft circled and observed no less than three times before dropping its bombs in order to hit the docks accurately. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<h3>British and German Naval Battle in the English Channel; German Fleet Retreats</h3>
<p>London: A British Admiralty communiqué stated that the British Navy engaged a German fleet in the English Channel. The German fleet was forced to flee towards Brest and is believed to have been damaged. One British ship was also damaged. Naval aircraft from the Mediterranean Fleet recently (date not announced) bombed the port of Laki on the island of Leros in the Aegean Sea and Tripoli in North Africa. German warships based in French ports have been using the heavy fog in recent mornings to pursue British ships and bombard the British coast, while using the concealment of the fog to evade British naval patrols. However, they have also been damaged by British ships, and not just one of them. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Haitong Press learned that the German Navy attacked British coastal merchant ships, sinking one 9,000-ton ship and one 3,000-ton ship on the evening of the 24th. At the same time, three escort vessels were sunk. A German destroyer sank a ship and several small boats the night before and engaged in a fierce battle with a British destroyer. A new British 1,900-ton destroyer was hit by two torpedoes and sank immediately. Another destroyer was hit in the middle and gradually sank. The German ships returned to base yesterday afternoon without damage. (Haitong Press, 30th)</p>
<h3>High Commissioner to Syria Dies in Plane Crash</h3>

<h3>The Times of London Discusses Japan's Pain</h3>
<p>London: The military correspondent of The Times, in an article entitled "Japan Feels the Pain," discussed the importance of the Nanning area abandoned by the Japanese army, stating that it belongs to the side of the route from Yunnan to Sichuan and can serve as an air base for attacking the Burma Road and Chongqing. The main reason for the Japanese army's retreat is believed to be economic. The Japanese army in China numbers about one million. Although the Chinese army has not been able to defeat them in one fell swoop, its strategy of containment has been very effective. Although Japan's gains in Vietnam may allow Japan to purchase rice to make up for its food shortages, they are not decisive in the absence of a turning point in the talks with the Soviet Union. To date, the Soviet Union has shown no signs of being willing to end its aid to China. (Reuters, 30th)</p>

<h3>Iron Guard Rampage – Romanian Political Situation Remains Tense – Over Two Thousand People Killed in Riots – Army and Guard Members Still Clash Frequently</h3>
<p>Budapest – Diplomatic sources revealed yesterday that a small-scale civil war is brewing in Romania. A major battle may erupt between the Romanian military and Iron Guard members. Since the killing of sixty-four officials from the era of former King Carol in the Jilava military prison on Wednesday, it is reported that nearly two thousand people have been killed in Iron Guard activities, most of them Jewish. Riots have occurred in various provinces of Romania, with street fighting in at least five towns. People are closely watching whether these riots will escalate into a tragic disaster, as they did during the funeral of Codreanu and his thirteen followers who were killed two years ago. According to some reports, the conflict between the Iron Guard and the Romanian military is intensifying. It is generally believed that the German delegation's visit to the Romanian capital to attend the ceremony for Codreanu and others indicates that Hitler may intervene in Romanian affairs. (November 30th, Cooperative Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Budapest – Diplomatic sources here report that approximately two thousand people have been killed in the Romanian Iron Guard riots over the past three days, mostly Jews. Since the shooting of sixty-four political leaders in the Jilava military prison, Iron Guard members and the Romanian army have engaged in scattered battles throughout the country. The bodies of Codreanu, the leader of the Iron Guard who was killed in 1938, and his thirteen followers are displayed in the Greek Orthodox Cathedral. The German delegation's participation in the funeral is seen as a sign that Hitler may intervene in the Romanian situation. The unrest in the Romanian capital is far more serious than reported by the censors. Furthermore, it is reported that two hundred Jews were killed in the Ploiești area. In Brașov, Craiova, and Turnu Severin, the Iron Guard clashed with the military and occupied buildings. The Brașov City Hall was later recaptured by the military. The situation in Ploiești is particularly serious, prompting Romanian Deputy Prime Minister and Iron Guard leader Horia Sima to personally go there to quell the unrest. News from the Romanian capital is censored and does not mention anti-Semitic sentiment. Local newspapers report that several Romanian army marshals have been ordered to return to the capital from the provinces. Yesterday, they were in transit. Romanian Prime Minister and Army Chief Ion Antonescu held a 24-hour conference with army officials and warned the Iron Guard leaders that "if the unrest continues, it will have serious consequences for the country," implicitly hinting at German intervention. Another report states that on Thursday night, the Iron Guard occupied the Jewish quarter of Galați and killed many Jews. Antonescu is reportedly considering forming a military cabinet, inviting several military officers to serve as cabinet ministers. The perpetrators of the shooting of sixty-four political leaders have not yet been arrested. People from the mountains are coming to the church to attend the memorial service, so the strict measures taken by the Romanian Prime Minister the day before have effectively been cancelled. (November 30th, United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>Budapest – According to well-informed sources here, reports from the Romanian capital indicate that five hundred Iron Guard members have been arrested for the crime of massacring two thousand Jews. Yesterday, people in the Romanian capital feared that Germany might use this as an excuse to turn all of Romania into a protectorate. It is rumored that young King Michael has left the country to be with his mother, Queen Helen, as the situation worsens and the tension between the Iron Guard and the army reaches a boiling point. Since King Carol abdicated and was exiled, his young son Michael has ascended the throne. However, it is rumored that this nineteen-year-old young king is already on his way to exile. Well-informed sources here also claim that thousands of Iron Guard members are now marching towards the Romanian capital with the army to quell a possible rebellion. It is reported that Romanian Prime Minister and Army Chief General Antonescu is currently conferring with several generals. If terrorism continues unabated, the Prime Minister is determined to declare military dictatorship today. The chaos in the region seems to have reached its peak. Armed terrorists are surrounding a Jewish quarter, firing indiscriminately at Jews. Riots have also reportedly broken out in the Romanian oil fields, which were recently destroyed by a major earthquake. It is also reported here that Romanian Deputy Prime Minister and official Iron Guard leader Horia Sima, after meeting with the Germans, led a team of his most trusted followers to Ploiești. The same sources also learned that twenty terrorist leaders who opposed Sima's leadership have been executed. Hundreds of Iron Guard members who massacred Jews have also been arrested. Therefore, Sima's restoration of order has been successful. Regarding the five hundred arrested Iron Guard members, it is rumored that Führer Hitler has dispatched a personal envoy, Nazi youth leader Baldur von Schirach, to the Romanian capital. It is said that if General Antonescu cannot restore order, he has been ordered to take control of the Romanian government, which has now declared martial law and is receiving German assistance. The Romanian capital is under strict military control, but it is rumored that terrorists are still pouring into the Romanian capital to participate in today's memorial ceremony for the late Iron Guard leader Captain Corneliu Zelea Codreanu.

<h3>Romanian Iron Guard Holds State Funeral for Late Leader – Hitler Sends Representatives to Attend</h3>
<p>London – Romania is currently in turmoil due to the Iron Guard's arrogance and the shooting of a large number of politicians involved in the anti-Iron Guard movement. Hitler is now making a special gesture towards the Iron Guard. According to German news agencies, Hitler will send official representatives to attend the reburial ceremony for the late Iron Guard leader Codreanu. The two German representatives, Baldur von Schirach, the Gauleiter of Vienna, and Bohle, the leader of Germans abroad, have arrived in the Romanian capital. (November 30th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Bucharest – The German delegation attending Codreanu's funeral, led by Bohle and Schirach, arrived yesterday afternoon at the Băneasa airport near Bucharest. Romanian cabinet minister Horia Sima represented the government to welcome them. Labor Minister Gherman Pântea and others also participated in the welcoming ceremony. German SA leader Lorenz had already arrived at the airport earlier. Undersecretary Paraschivescu also attended the welcoming ceremony. (November 30th, Haitong Telegram)</p>
<p>Bucharest – The news that German leaders Schirach and Bohle will attend the state funeral for Codreanu and his thirteen comrades has made a deep impression on the Romanian public. This morning at 8:30, the German leaders, representing Hitler, will lay a wreath at the church where the remains of the late Iron Guard leader are lying in state. At the same time, the German military delegation in Romania will also pay tribute to the late Romanian leader. The Italian ambassador will represent Mussolini, and representatives of the Fascist Party will also lay flowers. After the church ceremony, Iron Guard leaders, cabinet ministers, and the families of the victims will parade through the city. (November 30th, Haitong Telegram)</p>
<p>Former Case Reopened and Verdict Overturned</p>
<p>Berlin – Reports from Romania state that the case of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, the former leader of the Romanian Iron Guard who was arrested last year and shot while trying to escape, was reopened in Bucharest yesterday. The 1938 military court's verdict of high treason against Codreanu was overturned. In retaliation, the Iron Guard shot Romanian leader Professor Iorga on Sunday. His body was buried yesterday. The location and time of the burial were not announced. It is only known that over six thousand people attended the funeral. Many political and university figures attended. Speeches were prohibited. However, a company of infantry stood by to pay their respects. Professor Madgearu, the leader of the National Peasant Party and former Prime Minister, who was assassinated on Thursday outside Bucharest, was also buried yesterday.

<p>Perpetrators Will Be Severely Punished</p>
<p>Vichy – The official French news agency reports from Bucharest that the Romanian army leaders have assured the Prime Minister of their unwavering loyalty and support for his actions to punish those who cause trouble and provoke incidents. The rumors that many people have been executed in various provinces of Romania have been confirmed. The exact number of people killed in the past few days is currently unknown, with estimates ranging from hundreds to thousands. The government has promised to punish those responsible for the assassinations, but so far it appears that the extremist elements who orchestrated them have not been arrested. The official Romanian news agency claims that the entire country is now calm. The Iron Guard authorities are continuing to discipline certain members. (November 30th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Bucharest – Officials announced yesterday that the radical Iron Guard elements detained in the Romanian unrest will be severely punished. However, the number of people arrested was not announced. Officials also stated that 198 people have been killed throughout the country in the past few days. When a senior government spokesperson was asked by the press whether Queen Helen had been expelled and whether King Michael would also be expelled, he replied that this question was purely speculative and impossible to answer.

<p>Political Vendettas Arouse Public Outrage</p>
<p>London – Former Romanian ambassador to Britain, Tilea, stated that almost the entire country is praying for the victory of the Allies. Romania is a peace-loving and free nation. The world should not judge the Romanian people based on the shameful incident of the massacre of many important political prisoners. Those responsible for this are a small number of young people infected with European fanaticism. He is certain that 99% of the Romanian people condemn such actions. The actions of these fanatics reflect how weak and unpopular the current pro-German regime is in Romania. The Romanian nation has survived for two thousand years amidst the dangers of Europe and will continue to survive and cooperate with other civilized countries. After this statement was made, most of the staff at the Romanian embassy in Britain resigned and protested the recent political developments in Romania and the Iron Guard's wanton massacres.

<h3>Hungary's Expansionist Ambitions – Waiting for an Opportunity to Act</h3>

<h3>Free French Forces' Strength – Rapidly Increasing</h3>
<p>London – The strength of the Free French Forces under General de Gaulle is rapidly increasing. According to recently released figures, General de Gaulle's army has 24,000 troops awaiting orders in England. In addition, there are 20 warships, approximately 1,000 aircraft, and approximately 960 merchant ships at sea. Furthermore, General Catroux (recently appointed as the High Commissioner of the Free French Forces and representative in the Near East) told a Reuters reporter that approximately 180,000 French people in Syria sympathize with the goals of Britain, but it is not possible to be overly optimistic about Syria at the moment. Successors to Chiappe, the Syrian Governor appointed by Vichy, will undoubtedly adopt extremely strict measures to fulfill his mission, which is to suppress sympathy for Free France. Syria is quite dissatisfied with Vichy, believing that Vichy has abandoned Syria, as the Vichy government has never shown concern for Syria's fate since the arrival of the Italian Armistice Commission in France. Syria is also suffering from the British blockade, which is directly attributable to the Vichy government's unfriendly attitude towards Britain. General Catroux expressed satisfaction with Britain's rapid arming of the Free French Forces in the Near East, stating that the Free French Forces in the Western Sahara of North Africa are now fully mechanized. According to reports, many French people are following General Catroux, mostly from the army previously under General Catroux's command. (November 30th, Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>The Life of Prince Saionji</h3>
<p>Tokyo - According to the Nichi Nichi Shimbun, Prince Saionji, the last genro (elder statesman) of Japan, lived a solitary life and thus had no direct descendants. The Saionji family, during the Kyoto imperial court period, were traditionally biwa (lute) players before the emperor, and the family head considered the goddess of Lake Biwa as his ideal consort. In later generations, each family head, to honor the goddess, did not marry common women, making it a tradition. Succession was achieved through adopted sons. However, the prince's adoptive father exceptionally married a woman of the same surname. The prince was ennobled by the Kyoto imperial court at the age of eight, and at thirteen, he was appointed Grand Minister by Emperor Komei. When Emperor Meiji ascended the throne, the prince, only eighteen years old, was appointed the pacification commissioner of the Sanindo region. In the second year of Meiji, the prince had a Western-style suit custom-made at a Kobe store and boldly walked into the imperial court, causing a great uproar among the ministers. Count Ohara accused him of disrespect towards the emperor. The prince immediately replied that if the Japanese court dress was not replaced by Western clothing within the next few years, he would commit seppuku (ritual suicide) to apologize to the nation. Later, the Japanese court dress was indeed replaced by Western suits, proving the prince's foresight. In addition, the current Prime Minister Konoe also published an article in the Nichi Nichi Shimbun, recounting anecdotes about the prince's life, stating that he was extremely mindful of foreign etiquette. When Konoe attended the Paris Peace Conference with him, the prince advised him to wear diplomatic dress. The prince disliked medical injections. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 29th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Petroleum Production Increases</h3>
<p>Moscow - The Soviet People's Commissar for Petroleum, Sedin, stated in an article published in "Pravda" that in 1939, Soviet petroleum production increased from 164,700,000 tons to 180,000,000 tons. At the same time, gasoline production was 65,000,000 tons and lubricating oil was 5,000,000 tons. Soviet consumption and production are both less than those of the United States. The Soviet Union has the world's largest petroleum reserves and will increase production in 1941. (Haitong dispatch, 30th)</p>

<h3>Chinese Constables in Central District Briefly Stage Walkout - Resumed Duty as Usual Yesterday Afternoon - Chinese Constables Have Made Reasonable Demands - Yu Qiaqing Mediates, Promises Negotiations Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Chinese Constables Express Determination Not to Be Exploited</p>
<p>Chinese constables from the Jing'an Temple, Gordon Road, Putuo Road, and Xinzha substations in the Public Concession, due to high prices and limited income, staged a brief walkout on the afternoon of the 27th, demanding improved treatment. Fortunately, the police authorities handled the situation effectively, expressing their acceptance of their demands, which prevented the situation from escalating. However, after the Municipal Council announced the budget increase for Chinese constables' housing allowances from November 1st the night before, a portion of the central constables expressed dissatisfaction, stating that the increase was limited and did not solve the problem. They implemented a walkout at 11 p.m. that night, which was resolved after the Chinese Deputy Superintendent Liang Bingjun agreed to relay their concerns to the authorities for negotiation. However, at 7 a.m. yesterday, over 700 Chinese constables from the central substation and over 300 from the Old Zha substation suddenly walked out again (other substations did not join), leaving the Nanking Road area unmanaged, causing a serious situation for a time. Around 10 a.m., Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a Chinese director, arrived to persuade them, agreeing to mediate and instructing them to resume duty first, then present reasonable demands and appoint representatives to negotiate with the authorities on Monday (2nd). The constables, understanding the greater good, expressed their acceptance and gradually resumed duty near noon, restoring traffic order. The Chinese constables have also put forward reasonable demands, and details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Municipal Council Announces End of Uprising</p>
<p>According to the Municipal Council's Information Office, the Chinese constables in the Public Concession were dissatisfied with the rice allowance and the increased housing allowance measures announced by the Municipal Council yesterday, leading to a strike at the central and Old Zha substations. The other substations were relatively calmer. After the incident, Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing and Police Deputy Superintendent Yao Zengmo met with representatives of the Chinese constables. The situation was quite positive, and all the Chinese constables have now resumed duty as usual, resuming their demands, so the above uprising has come to an end.</p>
<p>Chinese Director Guarantees Satisfactory Response</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing felt that the constables' walkout would have a significant impact on public safety. Therefore, yesterday morning around 10 a.m., he and Yao Zengmo, the Chinese Deputy Superintendent of the Police Department, went to the Old Zha substation to make earnest appeals to the sixteen representatives elected by the Chinese constables from the eight substations in the Public Concession. He expressed sympathy for the constables' hardships and said that he guaranteed that their demands for improved treatment would be fully addressed. He hoped that, for the sake of the overall situation, they would immediately resume duty. As for the conditions they proposed, it was agreed that on Monday (2nd), they would send representatives to negotiate with the authorities. All the representatives understood the greater good. After Yu's persuasion, the representatives immediately returned to their substations and informed all the Chinese constables, who immediately resumed duty. However, because some Chinese constables had already left their posts and gone out at that time and were unaware of the news, only a portion resumed duty after 10:30 a.m., and order was only restored to normal after noon.</p>
<p>Investigation of Current Salaries of Chinese Constables</p>
<p>It is found that the Police Department's method for treating Chinese constables is that after a six-month training period (i.e., the so-called "drill class"), their salary is 21 yuan per month. Currently, an additional 80% subsidy is added, plus a housing subsidy of 9 to 11.5 yuan, plus a rice subsidy of 8.93 yuan, so the minimum income is 56.28 yuan to 58.28 yuan. After that, there is an annual salary increase of 1 yuan. The monthly salary of a Chinese police sergeant (i.e., "three-stripe") is a maximum of 42 yuan, and the housing subsidy is 14 yuan, with the rest being the same as the Chinese constables.</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing Expresses Sympathy and Assistance</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Yu Qiaqing gave a speech expressing great sympathy for the living conditions of the Chinese constables. He said that current rice prices are manipulated by rice speculators, leading to this situation. Therefore, the constables' claims of living difficulties are indeed true. As for the content of the conditions proposed by the constables, some may be inappropriate. Therefore, when he persuaded the constables of the central and Old Zha substations today, he repeatedly enlightened them and asked them to provide the minimum requirements for living expenses based on facts. Then, the Chinese constables from each substation should elect responsible representatives to submit them to the Superintendent, who would then report to the Municipal Council. As for suddenly going on strike due to the requirements of life, it is a great loss to the way of maintaining public order. Therefore, when I persuaded them, I repeatedly explained to all the Chinese constables that public security is paramount, and fortunately they were able to accept it, so I believe this matter can be resolved easily. Yu also said that the earliest reply on how to respond to the conditions required by the constables must be after next Monday, because according to procedures, Chinese constables from each substation must elect responsible representatives in the coming days, and their exact conditions must be submitted as late as next Monday to negotiate.</p>
<p>Chinese Constables Express They Will Not Be Exploited</p>
<p>After the Chinese constables in the Public Concession went on strike, public security was affected, and rumors spread, saying that ambitious elements were preparing to take advantage of the situation, and that the Chinese constables had been exploited, but none of these have been definitively proven. The reporter specifically interviewed representatives of the Chinese constables from various substations yesterday, who said that this strike was purely caused by the heavy pressure of life. The current price of rice has risen to over 90 yuan, but the constables' salaries are only 40 or 50 yuan. With this income, it is obviously impossible to support a family, so they had to make a request to the authorities for a salary increase. As for external concerns, they are purely rumors. Although the constables' lives are difficult, they all understand the greater good and will never be seduced by any party. The Chinese constables will continue to be responsible for maintaining public order within the Concession and will not threaten the residents.</p>
<p>A Letter Expressing Honesty and Loyalty</p>
<p>Yesterday, a letter signed "A Group of Chinese Constables" was submitted to this newspaper, stating: "Editor, yesterday I saw in your newspaper that the Chinese constables of the Municipal Council asked the Police Department for a salary increase and went on strike, but after being addressed by Police Chief Major Bowen, they immediately resumed their duties. There were no other circumstances. The demands made by my colleagues this time are actually due to the problem of life and there is no ulterior motive. Most of the constables have served for many years and deeply understand the various difficult situations of the administrative authorities, and the authorities also know the living difficulties of my colleagues, so there is room for discussion between the two parties. My colleagues have long recognized the current environment and their own position clearly and will never fall into the trap of schemers, so that fishermen can profit, and hope that the authorities will announce the measures as soon as possible, so that my colleagues can serve with peace of mind and resolve the doubts of citizens. Herewith a detailed letter, I wish you good writing, A Group of Chinese Constables respectfully, November 30th."</p>

<p>Moyler, the Inspector General of Customs, returned to Hong Kong from Singapore after leaving Shanghai on official business. Yesterday, it was learned from the Office of the Inspector General of Customs that Mr. Moyler had originally planned to take the Empress of Russia, a steamer of the British Changxing Steamer Company, to Shanghai from Hong Kong. However, he received a telegram stating that the ship had been ordered by the British government to suspend sailing to Shanghai and decided to wait for a steamer to postpone his return to Shanghai. However, the telegram did not mention which ship he would change to and the date.</p>
<h3>Scots Celebrate National Day</h3>
<p>British Scots residing in Shanghai celebrated St. Andrew's Day, also known as Scottish National Day, yesterday (30th). At 8:30 a.m., Mr. Cleland, President of the St. Andrew's Association, led members in a simple and solemn wreath-laying ceremony in front of the Peace Memorial on the Bund. It is expected that Mr. Cleland will, as usual, appeal to all sectors for donations to help poor Scots. The National Day service was held at the New Tian'an Church on Sunday morning. The St. Andrew's Dance has been cancelled due to the war.</p>
<p>British Sailors' Association to Close Today</p>
<p>After the withdrawal of the British garrison in Shanghai, the East Surrey Regiment and the Seaforth Highlanders, the British Military Hospital and Club on Central Road in Shanghai closed one after another. The Union Jack Club on Maypole Road has recently decided to close today due to the withdrawal of British forces in China. All furniture and other items are piled up in the club's plaza. Once the war ends or British troops return to Shanghai, it can be restored.</p>
<h3>The Zhu Boquan Kidnapping Case is Under Search</h3>
<p>Mrs. Zhu Leaves Home to Avoid Disaster - Her Own Car Has Been Found</p>
<p>According to the English-language Great American Evening Post, the police were still searching yesterday for the whereabouts of banker Zhu Boquan, who was kidnapped at the intersection of Haig Road and Eddington Gardens at 10 a.m. the day before. The rumor that Mrs. Zhu was kidnapped at the same time is not true. However, she went out an hour after her husband was kidnapped and has not returned to her residence at 644 Haig Road, so her relatives and friends do not know where she is now. Mrs. Zhu's departure from her home, as far as is known, is because after her husband was kidnapped, she felt unsafe living in the house. It is also heard that before Mr. Zhu was kidnapped, he had received several threatening letters demanding a very large sum of money. Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Zhu's own car, No. 48, was found in the fields 50 yards north of Zhao Feng Park. According to the person who found the car, three farmers saw a man in the car the day before calling for help and struggling with three other people in black clothes in the car. When the person who found the car invited the "City Police" Zhao to come 15 minutes later, the car was empty. This car was the car that the kidnapped person had taken half an hour earlier.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Situation in the Bustling City After the Chinese Constables' Strike - Shops Closed as if It Were the Lunar New Year - Chaotic Traffic, Fortunately No Accidents</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, after more than 1,000 Chinese constables went on strike, the central district of the Public Concession suddenly fell into a state of noise and chaos. Because the patrolmen directing traffic were reduced, the sounds of car horns, brakes, and rickshaw pullers were intertwined, noisy like thunder. At the same time, the shops along Nanking Road, fearing accidents and safety, closed their doors one after another. The four major companies reopened their iron gates and only opened the back doors for entry and exit. Although a few of the bustling Nanking Road shops operated as usual, most of them stopped, almost like the Lunar New Year's Day situation.</p>
<p>Traffic along the Bund to the Racecourse was extremely congested. At the busiest times, a journey that normally takes 10 minutes took half an hour. At intersections, where there are usually three or four Chinese constables directing traffic, there is now only one Western constable in their place, which means that they are waving their hands and overwhelmed. Because Western constables lack experience in managing traffic lights, the traffic lights are turned on and off incorrectly. The rickshaw pullers, who normally fear the Chinese constables like tigers and dare not wander around on the road without passengers, were very comfortable and free yesterday morning. The safety first training they received last week was long forgotten.</p>
<p>At the Yu Qiaqing Road intersection, there was only one Western three-stripe in charge of opening the traffic lights. At the Fujian Road intersection, there was also only one Western constable directing traffic. The busiest Zhejiang Road intersection (i.e., the Rising Sun Building) is a five-way intersection. Normally, in addition to an Indian constable in the road booth who is in charge of opening the traffic lights, there are many Chinese constables who help maintain traffic at the intersection. Now this five-way commander-in-chief (Indian constable) who occupies the road is no longer seen. Several Western ticket inspectors from the tram company temporarily took over the job of directing traffic. In the other ordinary intersections, few patrols were seen. This situation is rare.</p>
<h3>Miss You Suzhen - Voluntary Dance to Raise Money for Warm Clothing for Refugee Children - Date: Tonight from 9:30 PM to 2:00 AM - Location: Yindu Dance Palace, Foch Road</h3>
<p>Miss You Suzhen, the leading star of the Yindu Dance Palace at the intersection of Foch Road and Chichiang Road in this city, is a famous socialite from a prominent family. Due to environmental circumstances, she went to sea to dance in Vienna a few years ago, which was extremely popular and famous throughout the country. However, she retired to her home before August 13th, living a recluse life. Last month, Yindu opened to pursue friendship, and she went to sea for the second time. Her popularity is not reduced from the past, she can be called the Queen of Red Stars. Miss You has always been public-spirited and has a very masculine spirit. In view of the recent trend of cold weather, and the news that street children have been frozen to death, she consulted with the Yindu authorities and agreed to voluntarily dance for one day from 9:30 tonight to 2:00 midnight. However, tickets are not sold on this day, and all the dance money earned on that day will be donated to the refugee children for warm clothing. This is really commendable. There is no shortage of generous benefactors in the whole world. It is hoped that they will enthusiastically support Miss You's charity, and also ask thousands of sisters in the dance world to respond in groups. From then on, the refugee children will have warm clothes. This is also a very glorious thing for the dance sisters!</p>
<h3>One Hundred Killed and Two Hundred and Fifty Injured in Shanghai-Nanjing Train Bombing - The Situation Is Extremely Serious</h3>
<p>According to reliable news obtained by the English-language Great American Evening Post shortly after 2:00 p.m. yesterday (30th), the number of deaths in the train bombing near Suzhou the day before (29th) increased to nearly 100 yesterday, and there were at least 250 injured, many of whom were seriously injured.</p>
<p>Those Who Planted the Landmines Had Already Retreated</p>
<p>Reliable Japanese sources claim that the train, carrying hundreds of passengers from Shanghai to Nanjing to attend yesterday's signing ceremony, was detonated by landmines planted by Chinese guerrillas five miles from Suzhou, causing the train to derail. The bombers had already retreated and were not captured. The explosion caused the locomotive and five train cars to derail and be destroyed. Debris flew hundreds of yards away.</p>
<p>Japanese Newspapers Did Not Mention a Word</p>
<p>The Japanese Headquarters remained silent about the case yesterday and forbade Japanese newspapers from reporting the news. Therefore, the Japanese newspapers in this city did not mention a word yesterday morning. It is believed that the bombers intended to bomb a special express train that left Shanghai shortly after the regular train, believing that it carried many Japanese officials to Nanjing. After the accident, train traffic was immediately suspended, and many people who planned to go to Jiangning were unable to travel.</p>
<p>The Serious Situation Is Unprecedented</p>
<p>The debris of the train was not cleared until the night before, and regular traffic could be restored. It is said that today's trains are running as usual. This case is a rare and serious incident in the history of Chinese railways. There have been repeated incidents of Chinese guerrillas bombing the railway intermittently, and the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway has been attacked by guerrillas for more than two years, but the damage caused has been minor in nature.</p>
<p>The Prior Arrangement Seemed Extremely Careful</p>
<p>Observers here believe that the guerrillas had planned yesterday's bombing for a long time and had carried out various detailed measures carefully in order to succeed in one fell swoop. China is expected to use the facts to prove that the Japanese-Nanjing side is unable to control its main central areas.</p>
<p>A Large Number of Coffins Were Shipped to Hold the Corpses</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, the bombed vehicles were third-class passenger cars. When they passed the scene of the accident, the landmine suddenly exploded. With a bang, the locomotive bore the brunt and was blown to pieces. At the same time, eight passenger cars behind the locomotive were bombed, and the other cars derailed and leaned against the roadside. It was discovered afterward that there were about 300 men, women, and children killed and injured. The bodies of those killed were piled up on the open ground next to the track and covered by small tents to hide the bodies. The destroyed tracks and sleepers were repaired that night. Yesterday, a large number of coffins were shipped from Shanghai and Suzhou to the scene of the accident to hold the bodies.</p>
<p>The Station Inspection Was Exceptionally Harsh</p>
<p>The Great China News Agency reporter learned from the station that the tracks that were bombed at Waikuatang were repaired that night. Therefore, yesterday, the passenger trains from Shanghai to Nanjing ran as usual. Due to the one-day interruption of traffic between Shanghai and Nanjing, passengers were crowded, and the station inspection was stricter than before. At the entrance to the ticket office, three or four Japanese military police stood with guns, and when passengers rushed forward, they used bayonets to block them. Then, a wooden table was used to block two passageways, separating men and women, so that the "road police" could carry out an extremely threatening search of passengers. Even small objects were repeatedly interrogated. If passengers were slightly crowded, they were expelled with wooden sticks, causing weak women and children to cry and run away in embarrassment. Small pieces of gauze and paper cigarettes were confiscated. According to visitors from Wuxi, when the passenger car they were traveling on from the day before crossed Waikuatang to Weiting Station (about 20 miles away), they suddenly heard a loud bang behind them, which sounded like thunder, which shows the intensity of the explosion at the time.</p>
<h3>Merchants and Residents of Yuyao Must Have a Guarantor and Obtain a Certificate for Export</h3>
<p>Visitors from Shanghai to Zhejiang have recently taken the road from Zhapu to Yuyao to travel back and forth. In order to prevent young men from leaking into the sea and protect legitimate merchants for export, the Yuyao County Government has specifically stipulated the interim measures for the export permit for merchants and residents of Yuyao County. Regardless of whether they are merchants and residents from the county or other counties, they must fill out an application form and have a guarantor for a solid shop of more than 2,000 yuan, pay the certificate fee, and be issued an export permit before they can export from the coast of Yuyao or Andong. The certificate fee is 10 yuan per merchant or young man, and 5 yuan per student or person under 15 or over 40. It has now been decided to implement it from December 1st.</p>
<h3>Madam Zou's Memorial Service Today</h3>
<p>Madam Lu Xiongzhen, the first wife of Mr. Zou Chengding, Secretary of the Political Department of the French Concession Police, passed away at the Shanghai Maternity Hospital on September 28th of this year at the Yin hour (3-5 AM) due to illness. A memorial service will be held for her today (the 1st) at the Shanghai Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. Mr. Zou has a wide circle of friends, and all his relatives and friends will attend the service to offer their condolences.</p>
<p>The Chinese police officers who are temporarily off duty were seen yesterday morning either strolling alone on the streets or chatting in groups of twos and threes, displaying a leisurely and carefree air. Even the few Chinese officers directing traffic appeared listless, frequently leaving their posts to stroll for a moment every few minutes, or engaging in casual conversations with passersby. Some Indian officers seemed to adopt a detached attitude. When someone inquired about their opinions, one of them smiled and said, "Of course they want to strike, as their earnings are not enough to cover their expenses. Even our salaries are hardly enough to make ends meet." Fortunately, public security was temporarily maintained by the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, which dispatched teams of five people to patrol various locations. Western police officers patrolled the roads on motorcycles.</p>
<p>However, despite the traffic chaos in the central district, no accidents occurred. According to fire department personnel, this was perhaps because everyone was being particularly careful, thus avoiding any mishaps. At the same time, the number of robberies did not increase as expected. Large groups of Chinese people stood at street corners, watching the slow-moving traffic with amazed expressions. Dozens of students were playing in the middle section of Nanjing Road, and several cars were parked in no-parking zones, but no one intervened. Outside the central district, chaotic situations were less common, as the striking Chinese police officers were limited to the Central and Old Zha Gate police stations.</p>

<h3>The Situation in Western Shanghai Became Serious Again Yesterday - One Soldier Shot - Assassin Disappeared into Nearby Lane - A Cobbler Killed by Stray Bullet</h3>
<p>At 2:20 PM yesterday, a Japanese military policeman was shot and wounded near Lane 52 of the Great West Road. He was sent to Hong'en Hospital, and his condition is quite serious. At the time of the incident, another military policeman and a "city policeman" returned fire at the assassin, but missed. As a result, the assassin disappeared into a nearby lane and vanished without a trace. A stray bullet struck and killed a cobbler. At the time, Hui'erte, the suspect in the massive copper block theft case at the Ruifeng Transport Company warehouse, who was involved in the theft of two million yuan, witnessed the entire incident.</p>
<p>The Injured Sent to Hong'en Hospital</p>
<p>At the time, Hui'erte and a friend were in a car dealership when they suddenly heard gunfire. They rushed outside to investigate and saw a Japanese soldier firing a gun, and a "city policeman" was also assisting with a rifle. However, they could not see who they were shooting at. Nearby, they saw another Japanese military policeman lying motionless on the ground, and a Chinese man was injured and screaming in the lane. Hui'erte then showed his documents and instructed the Japanese military police to transport his injured companion to Hong'en Hospital in his private car.</p>
<p>Traffic Blockade and Extensive Search</p>
<p>Afterward, several detectives from the Jing'an Temple Police Station invited Hui'erte to the scene of the incident to investigate the situation. Japanese soldiers and the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department search team had also arrived at the scene, and they blocked off traffic in the area until after 6 PM, when it returned to normal. The innocent cobbler was sent to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road by the Shanghai Municipal Council ambulance. Afterward, Japanese troops and police conducted an extensive search from Haig Road to Jessfield Road, but found nothing.</p>
<p>Public Buses Shorten Routes</p>
<p>At the time, public buses in the Public Concession, apparently to avoid trouble, all stopped at the Jing'an Temple, except for Route 7. The number of "city police" and Japanese military police on Yuyuan Road and Jessfield Road greatly increased, and security was particularly tight at the scene of the incident, with no one allowed to enter or exit.</p>
<p>Injured Japanese Soldier Named Sasaki</p>
<p>According to the News Agency, at 3:30 PM yesterday, another Japanese soldier was ambushed in the Shanghai Western District Extra-Settlement Road area. A Japanese military policeman was passing through Wangjia Lane on the Great West Road when he was suddenly ambushed by a man lying in wait there, who shot him with a pistol. The military policeman was hit and returned fire, causing a stray bullet to strike and kill a cobbler who had set up a stall there. After receiving the news, the Japanese dispatched a large contingent of soldiers and "police" to guard the area around the lane and set up barbed wire at the entrance, conducting a strict search of pedestrians and vehicles, but found nothing. It is reported that the injured Japanese soldier was a military police sergeant named Sasaki. It is also known that after the incident, the Japanese not only sealed off Wangjia Lane with wooden stakes, but also sent someone to each household in the lane to inquire about the incident. Sasaki's injuries are said to be very serious.</p>
<h3>Two Japanese Patrol Sergeants Officially Resign Due to Illness</h3>
<p>A batch of Japanese patrol sergeants in the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department previously submitted their resignations. Recently, Japanese patrol sergeants No. 854 Suzuki and No. 625 Asami have officially resigned due to illness.</p>
<h3>Dyeing Industry Goes on Strike - Authorities Mediate</h3>
<p>Nearly 2,000 workers in the silk and satin dyeing industry in this city recently declared a strike because their demands for improved treatment were not met. This has been going on for half a month. However, the employers in the industry are all silk shops and silk factories. Before the war, the dyeing fee was only 7 jiao per bolt, but after the war it rose to 2.5 yuan, and recently it has risen to over 4 yuan per bolt, an increase of nearly five times, which is unprecedented in other industries. The labor side demands that each bolt be set at 30 yards, and any excess must be calculated accordingly. The dyeing factories refused the request because they could not increase prices, and the opinions were too divergent to be reconciled. Therefore, the labor unrest is difficult to resolve, and the business of various silk shops and silk factories has been suspended as a result. In order to eliminate the unfortunate labor unrest, the Concession authorities decided to send personnel to mediate, in the hope of resolving the issue as soon as possible and stabilizing society.</p>
<h3>A Loud Boom and Thick Smoke - Strange Loud Noise in Nanshi</h3>
<p>At around 9 AM yesterday, a loud boom suddenly occurred in Nanshi. Many residents living in the area close to the French Concession and Nanshi heard it. It is said that the sound originated near the Jiangnan Shipyard in Gaoyu Temple in Nanshi. At the same time, someone noticed an airplane flying over the area before the loud noise occurred, and then a black object fell, followed by a loud boom and thick smoke. The origin of the loud noise is currently unknown.</p>
<p>Many Killed and Injured in Explosion</p>
<p>Also, according to the Pingming News Agency, there were reports of bombing in Nanshi yesterday. Some said that a Japanese plane lost a bomb by mistake when it passed over Longhua due to mechanical failure. Others said that there was guerrilla warfare across the river from Longhua. The truth is unknown. According to reliable sources, at around 2 PM yesterday, someone threw a hand grenade at the Jiangnan Shipyard in Nanshi, causing an explosion that killed and injured many people. The details are also unknown.</p>
<h3>Jinan Parcel Post Suspended</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration previously announced that all parcels destined for Jinan and surrounding areas would be temporarily suspended due to transportation difficulties in the Jinan area. It is now known that this suspension notice from the Administration remains in effect. However, parcels and mail destined for Qingdao and various locations in Eastern Shandong, except for large quantities and those with declared value, are now accessible.</p>
<h3>Temperature Drops Suddenly - Shelters Being Built Hastily</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory reported that the minimum temperature yesterday morning had suddenly dropped to 32.7 degrees, breaking the record for the lowest temperature this year. The sunshine during the day was warm and pleasant. As the season turns to winter, the climate will soon become severely cold. Residents are advised to prepare warm clothing as soon as possible, and homeless and destitute people on the streets should also be quickly provided with relief to avoid freezing and starvation.</p>
<p>Corpses Froze to Death on the Road the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>Pushan Villa learned that a total of 22 adult corpses and 49 children's corpses, totaling 71 corpses, were collected by the Villa the day before yesterday. According to the Villa's speculation, the number of deaths yesterday, when the weather was suddenly cold, must be far greater than the day before yesterday. The winter days are long, and the problem of hunger and cold among these poor people urgently needs to be addressed and settled.</p>
<p>Shelters Being Built Hastily</p>
<p>The weather in this port has turned severely cold, and winter relief work urgently needs to be carried out. A reporter from the Datong News Agency visited Mr. Huang Hanzhi of the Joint Disaster Relief Committee of Charitable Organizations yesterday afternoon and was told that the reed sheds for the shelter at the Yan Family Residence on Difeng Road have begun to be built. There are now more than ten people working, and it will take about half a month to complete the construction. The shelters will then successively accommodate beggars and poor people from the streets, with a planned initial capacity of 1,600 people. Management will be strict and peaceful. Because last year, quite a few beggars addicted to white flour were not accustomed to a disciplined group life and escaped, strict management is necessary this year, and agreements have been reached with smoking cessation hospitals to force addicts to quit their habits, so that these people can see the light again after leaving the shelters. The refugees in the shelters will be provided with two meals a day, which must be filling. A clinic and bathroom will also be set up in the shelters. Upon entering the shelters, they will first be bathed, then shaved, and then given cotton-padded coats and trousers. The administrators are all experienced people who have handled these matters for many years to ensure proficiency. Poor people who are sick and need hospitalization will be sent to the Red Cross Refugee Hospital for treatment. According to Mr. Lu Deshen, who is supervising the construction of the reed sheds, the shelter has been strengthened with wooden frames and double-layer berths have been started. The work is progressing very quickly.</p>
<h3>Buddhist Community Plans to Build a Public Cremation Pagoda</h3>
<p>The Public Cremation Pagoda initiated by the Buddhist community has now set up a preparation office at the Buddhist Studies Bookstore on Yuyuan Road. A reporter from the Daguang News Agency visited yesterday and learned that the cremation is specifically prepared for cremating the corpses of monks from various temples after they pass away. The ashes are then sealed and placed in the Public Pagoda. However, there is very little land in the Concession suitable for building such a cremation facility, which is quite a problem. As for lay Buddhists who believe in Buddhism and advocate cremation, they can also request cremation. The fundraising charter has been printed, and there are many people who have donated to support cremation. As soon as the location is determined, it can be put into practice.</p>

<h3>Rice Prices Rise Daily - Crisis Imminent - Evaluation Committee to Hold Expanded Meeting Tomorrow - Citizens Still Hope for Practical Solutions</h3>
<p>The rice market is obviously under special circumstances now. It should be regulated to emphasize people's food and maintain public order. The responsible parties should handle it sincerely. Why bother to say it? Recently, due to the unstable situation in the rice-producing areas of Southeast Asia, rumors are constantly changing, and the transportation of domestic rice to Shanghai is often obstructed. The rice market has no control, only rising prices without falling. Yesterday, the market was in great turmoil again, and rice prices in various stalls rose continuously, to the point where there was no goods in the market. Market prices were rising sharply, without end. The market was crowded, and hoarders not only refused to sell their existing goods at asking prices, but also absorbed existing goods. The market management committee also rang the bell to close the market early at around 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>Measures of the Evaluation Committee</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market's rising trend was fierce. The Bean and Rice Industry Association and Rice Evaluation Committee of this city, in view of the boiling public opinion, held an emergency temporary meeting at its association at 15 Edinburgh Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. After discussion, it was decided to hold an expanded meeting of the Rice Evaluation Committee at 3:00 PM on Monday, December 2nd. Notices have been drafted and sent, and it was also decided to send separate letters to the authorities of the two Concessions and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, inviting representatives to attend on time to provide guidance. Residents of the entire city hope that all parties attending the meeting will discuss and negotiate concrete methods to stabilize the rice market and implement them effectively.</p>
<p>Regulations Are Equivalent to Dead Letters</p>
<p>Since speculators have entered the rice market and become very active, most transactions are selling short and empty trades. Rice industry groups previously resolved that, in order to stabilize the rice market, they must follow the regulations that customers sell to brokers, and brokers sell to stores. Initially, the industry could follow the transactions, and speculators could not participate in activities. Now, these regulations have long become dead letters. However, the organization of the rice market is originally to facilitate transactions between customers and brokers, and stores and brokers. Now, customer goods are all controlled by speculators, and very little is sold directly to brokers. Rice stores have difficulties purchasing from rice firms because market prices fluctuate. Sometimes, they buy when prices are low, but they see the prices rise instantly. They then sell immediately for profit, creating a chaotic situation where customers sell to customers, brokers sell to brokers, and stores sell to stores. Therefore, to stabilize the rice market, it is necessary to strictly follow the transactions of customers selling to brokers, and brokers selling to stores.</p>
<p>Hopes of the Shanghai Municipal Council</p>
<p>The English-language North China Daily News reported that responsible authorities recently stated that today's (30th) rice prices have risen again compared to yesterday (29th), and the food crisis is getting closer and closer. If steps are not taken to stop the manipulation of rice merchants in this city and find ways to ensure that domestic rice from the Yangtze River Basin can be transported smoothly, there will be no easing of this serious situation. Hoarders are unwilling to sell, so rice prices are rising day by day. According to the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Council's consultations with the Japanese authorities on allowing domestic rice from the Yangtze River Basin to be transported to Shanghai have not been agreed upon. The Shanghai Municipal Council hopes to reach an agreement with the Japanese authorities to allow at least the domestic rice needed by the poor to be transported to Shanghai, but this matter also depends on the attitude of the Nanjing government.</p>
<p>Flour Deduction Method Implemented</p>
<p>In order to further regulate people's food, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the French Municipal Council sent separate letters to the major foreign firms in this city that import foreign flour, requesting them to transfer one-tenth of the foreign flour to be resold to flour shops and sold at flat prices to genuine users in the two Concessions. It is now known that the four foreign firms, Jardine, Whittall, Daufu, and He Yi, have approved the Council's proposal and agreed to comply immediately. When the Hilliren Lifanara arrived in port on November 28th, it was loaded with more than 190,000 bags of rice flour, of which Jardine had 50,000 bags, Whittall had more than 90,000 bags, Daufu had 17,000 bags, and He Yi had 27,000 bags. Each of these foreign firms will separately deduct one-tenth, totaling a deductible amount of more than 19,600 bags, priced at 18 yuan per bag, to be transferred to the flour shops and sold at the above price plus a handling fee of 3 jiao. It is said that the fixed households of each of these foreign firms, in the spirit of serving society, have agreed to the deduction. This measure is very beneficial for stabilizing the flour market and regulating people's food, and is commendable. It is also known that the above flour deduction method will be implemented from December 2nd.</p>
<h3>Expert Teaches Seven-Stringed Guqin</h3>

<h3>Shipping Industry Confirms - The Haifu Wheel Has Been Detained</h3>
<p>The German-owned Lihe Shipping Company's Haifu Wheel has been sailing to Warm Harbor for a month. The ship had telegraphed the Shanghai company that it would leave Warm Harbor around November 10th to return to Shanghai. Later, passengers on the ship telegraphed that they were prevented from landing in Yueqing. Many days have passed, and the ship has not arrived in Shanghai, causing uncertainty about its whereabouts. According to a reporter from the Xin Sheng Daily, based on news from various sources in the local shipping industry, it is widely believed that the ship has been detained by Japanese warships. The company has repeatedly telegraphed to inquire, but there has been no response, indicating that the ship's radio station has been monitored by the Japanese and cannot communicate. It is also known that this ship was the last foreign ship to leave Warm Harbor and carried a large amount of passengers and cargo. It is unknown whether all passengers landed in Yueqing, so Zhejiang natives in Shanghai are concerned. The Haifu Wheel Shipping Department stated that the ship had no report of its whereabouts and could not provide sincere answers to inquiries from all parties. One theory is that the ship and the Moufu Wheel were detained at the same location. Lihe Shipping Company has requested the authorities to negotiate with the Japanese for the Moufu Wheel in the same way. Therefore, if the Moufu Wheel is released soon, the Haifu Wheel may also return to Shanghai. As for the other two ships, Feikang and Dasheng, there is still no news of their release as of yesterday.</p>

<h3>Massive Copper Block Theft Case - Accomplice, Punte, Released - Copper Blocks Were Shipped Out Under Instructions - Police Department Decides to Cancel Appeal</h3>
<p>According to the English-language North China Daily News, German national Punte was arrested by the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department and prosecuted for participating in the theft of copper blocks worth 2 million yuan from the warehouse of the American-owned Ruifeng Transport Company. The case has been going on for half a month. The German Consul General in Shanghai opposed the Shanghai Municipal Council's prosecution of Punte because the main culprit in the theft, Swiss national Whiteley, was still at large. As a result, the Shanghai Municipal Council</p>
<p>Cancels Prosecution</p>
<p>The Special Court released Punte at 5:45 PM yesterday (29th). According to Punte's lawyer, Mr. Ham, the defendant was released after consultations between the Japanese authorities in this city and the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department. The Japanese authorities sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council, stating that the stolen copper blocks were confiscated by the Japanese Army, making it impossible for the Police Department to accuse Punte of theft. However, the Police Department found that Punte shipped out the copper blocks</p>
<p>Under Instructions</p>
<p>Not out of theft, so it was decided to cancel the appeal. According to reports, Punte was arrested in early October at his residence at 7 Hongkou Pai He Lane on suspicion of colluding with the thief Whiteley. Whiteley was living in the Broadway Mansion. The Police Department sent personnel to arrest him, but it was unsuccessful due to interference from the Japanese Military Police.</p>
<h3>Large Gang of Thieves Rob in the Middle of the Night</h3>
<p>At 0:10 AM yesterday morning, a large gang of more than 20 thieves suddenly arrived at a silk cloth factory at 119 Xinjiapo Road in Western Shanghai. They carried lethal weapons such as pistols, knives, and clubs. After rushing in, they began to search and rob. They stole 20 bolts of cloth and clothing worth about 1,300 yuan. After succeeding, the thieves fled through the door with the stolen goods. Unexpectedly, because there were many people and the noise was loud, and it was late at night, they were spotted by patrols from the Public Concession, who knew that they were not good people. They ordered them to stop, but the thieves preemptively opened fire to resist arrest. The patrols also returned fire. For a while, there was a lot of gunfire. As a result, the patrols intercepted 14 bolts of cloth, killed one thief on the spot, and captured one thief alive.</p>
<h3>Yangzhen Ginseng Shop Robbed Last Night - Two Killed by Gunfire - Stray Bullets Injure Three, Including a Russian Patrolman - Six Thieves Fled Without a Trace</h3>
<p>At 8:30 PM last night, six thieves suddenly broke into the Yangzhen Ginseng Bird's Nest and Silver Fungus Shop at 403 Rue de Consulat in the French Concession. Three thieves took out guns and threatened the staff, robbing all the 600 yuan in the cash register. When the thieves were robbing, the French Concession Police received a report and immediately sent a large number of detectives by patrol car. When the car arrived in front of the Ginseng Shop, the thieves took the stolen goods out to escape. The thieves saw the detectives arrive, immediately opened fire to show off, and fled in different directions. The detectives also rushed out of the car and returned fire with their guns, firing many shots. At that time, an apprentice named Sun Baixiang (23 years old, from Ningbo) came out from inside the shop. The detectives mistakenly thought he was a thief and shot him in the waist. The bullet did not pass through, and he fell to the ground in a pool of blood. At that time, an old woman of about 50 years old was hit in the chest by a stray bullet, suffering very serious injuries and was in critical condition. Two other pedestrians, one Russian patrolman, and one rickshaw puller were all hit in the arms and legs by stray bullets. After being injured, they were sent to Guangci Hospital by ambulance summoned by Chinese patrolmen. Sun Baixiang and the old woman died soon after due to their serious injuries.</p>

<h3>Correspondence</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Upon reading today's edition of your newspaper's local news section, there was mention that Yuande Money Exchange was accused of speculation, involving Liu Jinbo from the accounting department of the China Industrial Bank. However, we have no such person as Liu Jinbo among our staff. The report is inconsistent with the facts. We are writing to request a correction. Sincerely, Shanghai China Industrial Bank, Document Section, November 30th.</p>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>We were quite surprised to examine today's news column in your newspaper, which contained a news item regarding the Puyi Real Estate Company allegedly forcing tenants of the Peien Apartments on Avenue Joffre to move out. Upon investigation, our company is neither the current owner of the said apartments, nor is it the current manager. Therefore, what your newspaper published is inconsistent with the facts and concerns the reputation of our company. Hence, we are writing to request that a correction be published. Respectfully, American Puyi Real Estate Company, November 30, 1940.</p>

<h3>Sino-Youth Charity Basketball Game: Shanghai Star Loses to Miles; Result: 47 to 62; In Women's Game, Jingwu Wins Against Shanghai Star Women</h3>
<p>The Sino-Youth Sports Department held a charity basketball game last night at its gymnasium on Eight Immortals Bridge to raise funds for the Christmas Orphans' Carnival. Shanghai Star was invited to play Miles, and as a result, Shanghai Star was defeated 47 to 62. In the first half, Miles took the lead with 32 to 11. Before the game, there was a women's exhibition match, where Jingwu won against Shanghai Star Women with a score of 22 to 17. In the game between Shanghai Star and Miles, Shanghai Star fielded Chen Xuechong, Liang Yunming, Yu Xunzi, Chen Bangzhen, and Zhuo Guorong, while Miles fielded Stoke, Mann, Roach, Xiang Shawitz, and Simpson. Roach of Miles opened the scoring, and Mann added two points. Liang Yunming of Shanghai Star made a layup, making it 2 to 4. After that, it was all Miles, with Shanghai Star only scoring one point from a penalty shot by Chen Bangzhen. Miles had a smooth run, creating a significant score of 22 to 3. At that time, Shanghai Star made adjustments to the lineup, but still, there was no improvement. The first half ended with Miles leading 32 to 11. After switching sides, Miles continued to take the lead, making it 40 to 11. At 56 to 27, Miles brought on reserve players, and Shanghai Star became very active, making the atmosphere tense. In the end, due to excessive points lost in the first half, they were unable to reverse the decline. Shanghai Star lost to Miles with a score of 47 to 62.

<h3>Hard Ball Table Tennis Tournament Opens Tonight with Exhibition; Li Shuxiong Invited to Serve</h3>

The three players from Qibu, Cheng Shuming, Hu Yiping, and Yang Kaiyun, are also experts in this field. It is difficult to predict who will win. The final act will be Chen Linsheng against Mrs. Di Fei. Chen is a veteran player, while Mrs. Di Fei is famous for her chop shots and has won the Vienna Women's Championship. She is determined to win tonight. If Chen is not careful, he may suffer a crushing defeat. In order to promote hard balls, the association is not selling tickets for this competition, but only giving away 400 admission tickets, which have already been given out. Also, Liu Kerren, the consultant for the cup, will donate a large silver cup to encourage the players, which will be awarded to the champion, but only if they win twice in a row can they keep the cup. In addition, Wang Yi of the China Table Tennis Company donated one pack of 01-branded standard balls, which is admirable. The full schedule for tonight is as follows:</p>
<p>Mao Yong -- Xu Junyan (Cup Tournament)</p>
<p>Weng Zhichao -- Feng Chanchu (Cup Tournament)</p>
<p>Zhang Yongru -- Mrs. Di Fei (Women's Singles)</p>

<h3>Balkan Front: Germany's Secret Door with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Molotov, the Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissioner, led a large delegation to Berlin last month in response to an invitation, which has been highly regarded by all parties. In reality, this trip did not have much impact on the superficial relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union. Below is a wireless report from the New York Times correspondents stationed in Istanbul, Turkey, and the capital of Hungary. Readers can consider it as background to Molotov's visit to Germany. It is translated and divided as follows:</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Germany's encroachment into the Balkans is not surprising, and the entry of German troops into Romania was also anticipated. What is shocking, however, is not the Balkans but Moscow.</p>
<p>Two months ago, the Soviet government, with swift and decisive action, demanded that Romania cede Bessarabia and Bukovina. Since then, it has launched a vigorous anti-German offensive throughout the Balkans, especially in Bulgaria and Romania, often relaying orders through the Comintern to local communists to engage in activities.</p>
<p>Hungary is Germany's granary for plundering Balkan food. The Bulgarian Communist Party has been actively working there, distributing various printed materials and engaging in large-scale propaganda. The Danube Commission meeting also failed to restore harmony between Germany and the Soviet Union. Although the Soviet Union, as a Danube nation, demanded to be present, the German government considered it unworthy of attention.</p>
<p>Although Germany cannot conduct opposing propaganda within the Soviet Union, it continues to recruit and train White Russian immigrants throughout the Balkans. In the event of war, they can join the German army to fight. As far as the reporter knows, the Soviet Union has evidence of this.</p>
<p>However, the Soviet Union still allows Germany's puppet regime to control power in Romania, preventing oil and food from being transported to the Soviet Union, and establishing a government that is half pro-German, half pro-Italian, and completely anti-Soviet. The Soviet Union's hope of expanding its base to resist Germany's final offensive against Bulgaria and Yugoslavia has almost been completely dashed, and its influence in both countries has been completely eliminated by Germany.</p>
<p>What is strange is that the Soviet Union, witnessing Germany's power extending to the Black Sea coast, directly reaching its own doorstep – the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits, remains calm and unmoved, as if undisturbed by others sleeping soundly beside its bed. No wonder the world is puzzled by this, sighing at its "unfathomable depth."</p>
<p>What exactly is the answer to this "Soviet Mystery"? Has Stalin been bought off by Hitler, promised control of the two straits, and other spoils in the Near East or the Far East? This is probably not the case. Even if Germany has such bait, the Soviet Union may not consider it of lasting value and be deceived by it.</p>
<p>Those in charge of Soviet policy would certainly not make such a mistake. The recent actions of Germany, their significance, and what they will face in the near future are already clear to them.</p>
<p>Today, the Soviet Union, on the one hand, maintains a wait-and-see attitude, and on the other hand, keeps it a secret, so that the people at home do not know the seriousness of the situation, which is Stalin's consistent style. Therefore, a group of journalists stationed in Moscow have no news to report. Moreover, since January of this year, the Soviet government has implemented "total censorship," so even if they can know or guess something, they cannot transmit it to the outside world. The reporter's desk has a telegram that has been subjected to "total censorship," which is a perfect proof.</p>
<p>Germany disregards the Soviet Union's demands regarding the Danube River and refuses to allow it to participate in the redistribution of Europe and Asia. Its own power is gradually extending towards the Soviet Union's doorstep. The Soviet government has been tolerating everything. There is only one reality that can explain this: the Soviet Union believes that its current strength is not enough to compete with Germany on an equal footing. This does not mean that the Soviet government will always tolerate this, but it must wait for the right opportunity to abandon the appearance of friendship with Germany and implement self-defense.</p>
<p>According to the reporter's personal observation, the Soviet Union will not take any action until winter, when the roads in Poland and Romania are inconvenient for military movement and German mechanized troops have difficulty passing through, or even until the German forces are engaged in intense battles in the Near East and Africa, with no time to spare.</p>
<p>At that time, the Soviet Union's plan will be to fully support its ally Turkey, in order to prevent Germany's power from further expansion. The German side also knows that once winter comes, the Soviet Union can remove its mask and stop Germany's secretly threatening attitude. Is this why Germany is eager to act in the Balkan Peninsula?</p>
<p>There is a widely circulated incident from Romania that proves the coolness of the friendship between Germany and the Soviet Union. It is said that a large number of eggs were transported from the Soviet Union to Germany and were detained by the Soviet authorities in Bessarabia. Whether it was intentional or unintentional, the eggs had already rotted after being detained for many days. After being released, the train slowly entered German territory. The train still had the slogans that Germans often put on Soviet vehicles: "This is another proof of German-Soviet friendship."</p>
<p>The Soviet Union certainly calculates that delaying conflict for one day means adding one day to its strength. Soviet authorities, both domestically and abroad, always say to foreign inquiries: "We hope not to get involved in this whirlpool of war." There is some truth in this statement.</p>
<p>Of course, they want not to get involved in the whirlpool of war, and they must not get involved in the whirlpool of war, but they also know that they will eventually have to get involved in the whirlpool of war. The problem for the Soviet government is when they can join this war. Should it be launched when food is sufficient and defenses are not solid, or should it be launched in the dead of winter, when the weather is extremely cold, transportation is difficult, and food is insufficient?</p>
<p>The Soviet Union today seems numb, but this does not imply that it cannot fight or cannot fight hard to defend its national status; it is only because once it fights, not only the entire Soviet system but also the foundation of its country will inevitably be gambling everything on one throw, so it cannot but be extremely cautious.</p>
<p>The reporter once asked someone who witnessed the Soviet army's entry into Poland how the Soviet tanks were.</p>
<p>He replied: I don't know how the Soviet tanks performed alone in the swamps at the time. I did see a few abandoned tanks, but as far as I remember, I saw countless tanks crawling and constantly moving. Occasionally, one or two would get stuck in the mud and be unable to move, and no one would care. In a blink of an eye, they were covered by the vehicles in front, behind, left, and right, leaving no trace.</p>
<p>It is said that their heavy artillery is arranged in rows, almost with wheels touching, and countless. The breakthrough of the Finnish Mannerheim Line was due to this. The Soviet Union has brave soldiers and sufficient military equipment. Although the quality is not as good as Germany, the quantity may be comparable. Once something happens, it will probably be used to resist the German advance! (From Istanbul, Turkey, October 12)</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>In August of this year, Germany held a meeting in Vienna, slamming the back door of Europe shut, giving the Soviet Union the cold shoulder, and then sent troops into Romania, tightly sealing this back door. Now Germany is gradually filling the "living space" in the Balkans. There is no room left for Rome, let alone Moscow.</p>
<p>Hitler's diplomatic skills are truly brilliant. The Vienna arbitration conference trapped Hungary in Germany's circle and plunged Romania into chaos. He presents himself as the protector of Romania's post-partition territory, clearly aimed at other countries, causing the Red Army eager to cross the Prut River to retreat. His alliance with Japan makes Stalin worry about his rear, and his decision with Mussolini at the Brenner Pass is even more natural.</p>
<p>German-Soviet relations have therefore entered a new stage. Germany's threat to the Soviet Union is more urgent than ever. Unless the masters of the Kremlin are willing to fight the Axis powers, they can only obey the instructions of the Nazi Party and restrict their development in the Near East.</p>
<p>What is strange is that although the Berlin-Moscow struggle uses national fortunes as a bet and small countries as sacrifices, the smoke screen of cooperation remains as before. The supply of kerosene from the Caucasus to Germany for military use has increased, and German delegations continue to visit the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Since the Vienna arbitration conference repeatedly sacrificed Romania to satisfy Bulgaria's desires, Balkan politicians mostly believed that the German-Soviet dispute was imminent. Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky declared in the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Parliament that Hungary should prepare for "bloody sacrifices" to prevent trouble before it happens. The chaotic Romanian side constantly spread rumors of border troubles along the Prut River. If the Soviet Union has a single soldier crossing the current border of Central Europe, it would be tantamount to crossing the border and invading Germany, which would inevitably provoke conflict.</p>
<p>But the changes brewing in Eastern Europe are more serious than the division of interests between Berlin and Moscow.</p>
<p>The border between the Soviet Union and Germany starts from the Baltic Sea, runs along divided Poland, puppet Slovakia, pro-Axis Hungary, and then crosses the border of increasingly shrinking Romania, reaching the northern end of the Danube Delta and the Black Sea. To the south and west of this border are all German protectorates, only the methods of protection are slightly different.</p>
<p>Germany is consolidating its strength behind this border. With German support, the exchange of populations between Romania and Bulgaria was finally implemented. That is, the Bulgarians in northern Dobruja all moved south to Bulgaria, thereby inserting a non-Slavic buffer zone between the Soviet Union and Slavic Bulgaria.</p>
<p>German Ambassador to Turkey, Papen, personally told the reporter that Germany could not sit idly by and watch the "Straits" fall into the hands of the Soviet Union. The reasoning is very clear: Wilhelm II had planned the "Three B's" route from Berlin to Baghdad, and the "Straits" are at the strategic point. Since Hitler has not explicitly abandoned this plan, how can he tolerate Soviet control?</p>
<p>While Germany hopes to keep the Soviet Union out of the Balkans, both sides are secretly working hard to deploy. The fundamental conflict between the two countries existed before the war and has not been eliminated after the start of the war. Pan-Germanism and Pan-Slavism are fighting fiercely. At the same time, Italy is also seeking raw materials from the Soviet Union on the one hand, and resisting the Soviet Union's encroachment on the Mediterranean sphere of influence on the other.</p>
<p>Germany's eastward policy has always been to go down the Danube. There is an old saying that "from Vienna to the Black Sea, you can stay overnight in a German village every night."</p>
<p>The natural economic connections between Germany and the Eastern European countries are a powerful force. Even in peacetime, more than half of the trade in this area belongs to Germany. The exchange of food and raw materials for manufactured goods, and the supply of high-quality fuel to German industry in exchange for manufactured goods, are the most prominent examples. Now that the sea routes have been blocked, land trade will naturally become more prosperous.</p>
<p>Germany's activities among the non-Slavic Balkan countries and the anti-communist bourgeoisie, in order to resist Pan-Slavism and communism, is also a powerful appeal. Hungary and Romania are already surrounded by Slovaks, Slovenes, Serbians, Ruthenians, Poles, Russians, Bulgarians, and Ukrainians. Once the Soviet Union sweeps across Europe, they will be like lone boats drifting in the vast sea of Slavic peoples, with no one to call for help.</p>
<p>The mysterious power of Pan-Slavism is a surprising element in Southeast Europe. Bulgarian farmers have an old saying that when they encounter difficulties, they will say: "Grandpa Ivan will come down the river to help us." Whether the Kremlin is ruled by the Tsar or the Communist Party is irrelevant to them, simple-minded people who make a living by farming. The magnificent cathedral in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, was built to commemorate the Russian army in the war with Turkey.</p>
<p>Therefore, under the guise of friendship, the secret struggle between the Axis powers and the Soviet Union is in full swing. The Kremlin is very appeasing to Germany, but at the same time, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria are full of leaflets and pamphlets attacking German and Italian imperialism, with not a word about Britain. The Italians only talk about the Soviet Union's great threat. The Germans boast that when the time comes, they will wipe out the Red Army as easily as chopping melons.

<h3>Food: Rice Hoarders Disregard the People's Food, Yesterday Prices Rose Wildly then Halted Trade, Foreign Rice Continues to Arrive in Endless Streams, The Key is to Stabilize the Rice Market and Equalize Rice Prices</h3>
<p>Large quantities of foreign rice have recently arrived in Shanghai. The French ship Aibert Sarrant, chartered by Wah Lun Foreign Firm, arrived directly from Saigon with more than 30,000 bags. It entered the port yesterday evening and docked at the Huashun Wharf in Hongkou. Unloading will begin today. The French company's ship Rosse, also carrying 1,600 tons of foreign rice from Saigon, was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday but has not yet arrived. It is expected to enter the port today. Jardine Matheson's ship Yongsheng arrived yesterday afternoon, carrying 1,488 bags from Hong Kong. Swire's ship Hunan arrived this morning, carrying 405 bags from Hong Kong. The ship Haikou also carried 300 bags from Hong Kong. Another 2,200 bags were transferred to Qingdao, and 501 bags were transferred to Yantai, all to be transported by military ships today. (Zu)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market again took advantage of the alleged detention of rice shipments entering the concession, intending to create a serious situation. On the other hand, it was rumored that Japanese warships had entered Saigon port and were about to take action in the south, leading to speculation about the suspension of Saigon ship transport. As a result, speculative hoarders were extremely active in the rice market, recklessly driving up prices, causing chaos. The price of Saigon No. 1 spot rose to 81 yuan, and No. 2 to 77 yuan, both new record highs. Yinghua Si No. 1 was bidding to buy at 94.5 yuan, but no sales were made. The December contract opened at 91 yuan, but there were plans to bid even higher. The December contract for No. 2 rose from 87.5 yuan to 89 yuan. The December contract for Xiaojiao was 84.5 yuan to 84.9 yuan in the morning, and rose to 85.5 yuan in the afternoon, all up about 2 yuan from the previous day, with a tendency to continue rising. The rice industry also felt that such a situation was inconvenient to publicly investigate, so they also halted trading and held an emergency meeting in the market to discuss ways to curb the situation. As a result of the discussion, a letter was sent to the Evaluation Committee urging them to immediately start the evaluation to maintain the people's food. The meeting ended at 11 o'clock. At noon, the rising trend slightly slowed down, and transactions also decreased. The total amount of rice on hand is less than 10,000 bags, and Yinghua Si only has more than 300 tons. The various requirements of the Evaluation Committee have long been adopted by the Municipal Council, partly because of their own interests, partly because many of the hoarders are wealthy and powerful and cannot be dealt with, and partly because they are afraid of offending their colleagues if they take it seriously, so they turn a blind eye. The municipal authorities also have no time to take care of it. In fact, all kinds of security problems in the concession arise from the high price of rice. Hoarding rice to prepare for famine is not a bad thing, but deliberately manipulating the market for profit is inexcusable. Therefore, the key is to stabilize the rice market and equalize rice prices.</p>
<h3>Hoarders Focus on Foreign Flour, Foreign Wheat Continues to be Ordered</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the foreign flour market showed a lively trend, because merchants and hoarders absorbed it without reservation for days. Many of the goods scheduled for delivery next month have already been sold off. Moreover, the concession authorities, believing that the output of local flour is insufficient, plan to allocate foreign flour to this street at a fair price. Therefore, speculative hoarders took the opportunity to push up prices. It is said that the newly arrived Australian flour, Clock Tower brand spot goods, can now be delivered. Yesterday, a local merchant handled 1,500 bags, at a price of 19.2 yuan. High-grade American flour is also standing at around 20 yuan, and the market is gradually rising. It is also said that the price of foreign flour scheduled for delivery at the beginning of the month, Flower Bird and Clock Tower brands, has risen from 18.8 yuan to 19 yuan, with a total of more than 7,500 bags sold off. The offer of No. 2 flour mill is still 18 yuan, with about 1,000 bags released by the two factories, which is not enough for the use of this street. Therefore, foreign flour is favored by local merchants.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the source was still scarce. In addition to the sporadic arrival of Du wheat transported by trucks for the use of Japanese factories, vendors rarely went to the source. The Japanese factories, finding it difficult to absorb Du wheat, also had to pay attention to foreign wheat. It is said that Sanxin Factory has ordered two ships, with a combined price of 14 yuan. One said that it was ordered by a Chinese factory, but it is currently difficult to confirm. The market transaction has been stagnant for a long time. The Shanghai wheat market has invisibly reached a dead end, which is really due to the current environment.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Also Rise</h3>
<p>Recently, under the erosion of the speculative frenzy in the rice market, prices have been rising steadily, and now it is no longer affordable for ordinary people. The middle and lower classes have no choice but to switch to flour, and the price of flour is also rising frequently. Therefore, poor people near the city are forced to fill their stomachs with pig feed such as corn and barley. Unexpectedly, the grain vermin are crazy and believe that the good opportunity cannot be missed, so they also follow the rice price and rise sharply. Yesterday, Saigon corn rose by more than 1 yuan in the absorption of hoarders, with the price reaching 22.7 yuan per picul. Red sorghum also rose to 20.06 yuan. At the same time, bran set an unprecedented high price of 19.8 yuan. If this continues, the poor will only sit and wait for death.</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Bean Cake Transported to Hong Kong</p>
<p>Yesterday (30th), there were 150 bags of beans transported to Hong Kong. Today (1st), there are also 820 bags of beans, 6,100 sheets of bean cake, 700 bags of raw materials, and 250 bags of sesame transported to Hong Kong. 730 bags of beans and 845 bags of sesame were transported to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Securities: Foreign Debt Rises, Climbing Steadily</h3>
<p>Securities grey market: Yesterday's market situation was quite chaotic due to rampant rumors in this port. Afternoon trading was temporarily suspended to ensure the clearance of morning transactions. Hongda and Hu He bought aggressively, and Xinchang's acquisition was also not weak, so C, D, and E bonds were weak at first but then strong. Shunchang had 200,000 shares of selling from the basket, and Xinfushengda also sold a lot. The #16 seller sold A bonds very vigorously. Although Lianyi absorbed them, it still failed to stabilize and broke through the 73 yuan level, with a trend of firmness with softness. It is feared that it will not be easy to be optimistic for a while, and the environment is full of rumors, making people uneasy. As a result of the market price, C, D, and E bonds rebounded by 5 cents, with D bonds alone rising by as much as 40 cents. B bonds only rose by a small 5 cents, and A bonds fell sharply by 60 cents. The chaotic state shows that the market price is unnatural. The transaction volume was about 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. The brief results of the half-day are listed in the table below.</p>
<p>Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>Unified A | 73.35 | 72.80 | 72.80 | Down 0.60</p>

The former British-German continuation loan (issued in Britain) was £36, the British-French loan (issued in Britain) was £38.5, Crisp was £17, and the Rehabilitation Loan (issued in Britain) was £27.5. The latter iron debt bonds, Beining Road was £46, Daoqing was £13.5, Jinghu and Huguang (non-German issued) were £14 each, Longhai and Huguang (German issued) were £12 each, Tianjin-Pukou original continuation issued were £11 each, and Guangzhou-Kowloon was £10. Among the British stocks in the Far East, only the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's London-registered stock rose by £1.5 to £68.5.

<h3>Rubber Trust Company Pays Final Dividend</h3>
<p>The Rubber Trust Co., Ltd., managed by HSBC Ocean Life, will hold its tenth annual general meeting on December 17 to report on the business for the year ending September 1940. The company's profit for the year is approximately 1.56 million yuan in national currency. In addition to the interim dividend of 60 cents in national currency already paid, it is proposed to pay a final dividend of 1 yuan in national currency, with a total dividend of 1.6 yuan in national currency.</p>
<h3>Economic Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Feng Liutang</p>
<p>Opium</p>
<p>What is "cage dregs"? It refers to using a bamboo frame lined with paper to filter the boiled opium sap. The liquid flows through the paper, while the dregs remain on the paper surface. In earlier years, these dregs were discarded. However, in recent years, due to the high price of opium, one often hears cries of "cage dregs!" in the alleys, indicating that even the dregs are valuable.</p>
<p>Opium is divided into major and minor categories. Major opium is further divided into "Gongban" and "Lazhuang" varieties. It is about the size of a soccer ball, with several layers of tobacco leaves forming a skin about a quarter of an inch thick, containing the opium paste. Buyers of major opium prefer thinner skins for more paste. Therefore, when buying whole major opium, similar to selecting pomelos, one holds the opium with both hands and presses it with both thumbs to ensure the skin is ripe and the contents are solid. However, after the opium reaches the retail stores, whether sold whole or in pieces, the contents are unlikely to be entirely original. Retailers can skillfully soak a particular area of the major opium's skin, then peel the skin layer by layer, creating a small round hole to extract the opium paste inside. They then mix it with various substances to increase the volume, refill it, and reseal the skin to look exactly like the original. The extracted opium paste is later sold as major opium, which is a form of fraud in the market.</p>
<p>Minor opium includes varieties like "Chizhuang" and "Jinhua." Unlike major opium, which contains paste, minor opium is solid, about the size of a fist, and wrapped in paper. In addition, there is Sichuan opium, produced in Sichuan, which is round and semi-flat at the bottom. Yunnan opium is softer than Sichuan opium. There is also Taizhou paste from Taizhou, Xiangshan paste from Xiangshan, and many other production areas with various names. According to a survey conducted during the Guangxu era, opium was grown in almost every province, especially in Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu, because they were far from the coast, making it difficult to obtain foreign opium, so they had to grow and consume it themselves.</p>
<p>Opium has the power to refresh, excite, anesthetize, relieve pain, and stop diarrhea, so it is called a "medicine," despite the prohibition against opium use. The prepared opium paste is called "Fushou Paste" (Longevity Paste) to emphasize its great efficacy. It is also called "Hibiscus Paste" (Furong Paste), derived from the poppy flower, from which opium is extracted. Therefore, opium smokers are called "Hibiscus Pavilion Masters," which is as ironic as the wronged souls in the underworld, like the play performed by Xia Yueshan at the New Stage in the early years of the Republic of China! As for why people smoke opium, it has been discussed with many addicts, but the story is long and beyond the scope of this article.</p>
<p>In the late Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, influenced by the New Policies and the effects of education, people generally recognized opium as a cause of national destruction. As a result, the advocacy of opium prohibition gained momentum. According to records, before Guangxu 5th year, approximately 70,000 chests of Indian opium were imported into China each year, each chest sold for 500 taels of silver, and China collected 30 taels in tax. In Guangxu 27th year, Liu Kunyi and Zhang Zhidong proposed an opium monopoly, noting that 59,161 piculs of foreign opium were imported in Guangxu 25th year. In the five preceding years, the average was around 50,000 piculs, with a maximum of 63,100 piculs and a minimum of 48,900 piculs. At a market price of five mace of silver per tael, the total value was 50 million taels of silver. Therefore, they proposed establishing an official bureau to sell opium at a 20% markup, which could generate an annual profit of 10 million taels of silver. Although the proposal was not implemented, the subsequent licensed opium smoking eventually led to the closure of opium businesses, which may have been the motivation. Although private opium became more profitable despite the ban, Indian opium ultimately disappeared.</p>
<p>However, while Indian opium disappeared, the opium that replaced it, as well as substitutes even more potent than opium, emerged in countless forms, becoming increasingly rampant. Recently, in addition to red pills and white powder, there is also something called "Ha." "Two Ha's" means getting high, but the poison is even worse than "red and white." In less than a year, one becomes emaciated and covered in poisonous sores! (End)</p>
<h3>Finance: Sellers Hesitate, Forward Foreign Exchange Demand Strong</h3>
<p>Foreign exchange market conditions: HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. Trading in the off-exchange British and American exchange market was slightly slow, mainly for end-of-month settlement. However, influenced by rumors, speculators continued to buy, causing sellers to hesitate and push up prices. Furthermore, due to high demand for forward contracts, the trend diverged from the spot market. At midday, spot British gold was quoted at 3 shillings 7.03125 pence, and U.S. dollars at 5.78125 yuan, tightening by 0.015625 and 0.03135, respectively, compared to the previous day. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.</p>
<p>Public Sentiment Agitated by Rumors</p>
<p>The morning opened with London telegraphic transfers at 0.125. New York silver prices remained stable, and spot gold was fixed. British to U.S. dollar and Shanghai rates were half, and U.S. dollar to 0.25. Shanghai was slightly lower, and there was no market for French francs. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained unchanged. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of 3 shillings 7.1875 pence for British gold and 5.8125 yuan for U.S. dollars. Later, speculators entered the market for settlement, offset by Hua Shang Bank selling, so prices remained unchanged. Speculators in the December U.S. dollar market entered Hua Xing Bank at 5.8125 yuan. HSBC's announced rates were consistent and unchanged. The white silver balancing tax was announced at a low of 0.75%. At that time, public sentiment became slightly suspicious, so speculators continued to purchase forward U.S. dollars, with some American banks offering speculators December contracts at 5.78125 yuan, up to 75 yuan. At midday, spot British gold was at 3 shillings 7.03125 pence and U.S. dollars at 5.78125 yuan. Next month's British gold was at 3 shillings 6.875 pence and U.S. dollars at 5.75 yuan. Spot British and U.S. dollars tightened by 0.015625 and 0.03125, respectively, and forward contracts narrowed by 0.03125 and 0.0625.</p>
<p>Hong Kong British and U.S. Dollars Unchanged</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 30th (Saturday) telegram: The foreign exchange market opened steadily this morning. British forward and spot prices and U.S. dollar spot prices remained unchanged. Shanghai spot prices rose by one yuan to 402.5 yuan, and Japanese spot prices tightened by one yuan to 103.5 yuan. At 11:30, it was reported as flat, with no changes in any currencies. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.</p>
<p>Tianjin British Flat, U.S. Dollars Tighten</p>
<p>Tianjin, 30th (Saturday) telegram: The foreign exchange market opened flat this morning. London telegraphic transfers remained unchanged at 4 pence. New York telegraphic transfers tightened by 0.03125 to 6.25 yuan. Shanghai exchange dropped by one jiao to 92.5 yuan. "Joint banknotes" on the black market rose slightly by one jiao to 86.4 yuan.</p>
<h3>Swap Ends, Gold Market Buying Surge</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw brisk off-exchange trading as the swap day for the first period transitioned to the third session. It was held from 8:00 to 9:00 AM, with buyers posting bids to sellers. Trading began before 8:00, initially with two silver firms swapping 500 taels at a premium of six yuan. Later, securities firms representing silver firms posted bids, causing the price to rise gradually to twelve yuan before the official listing. It then rose further to fifteen yuan, before stabilizing as gold shops and money changers joined in, ultimately settling at fourteen yuan. The second session for cash futures opened at 9:30, trending strongly. After the swap, buyers actively participated, and foreign exchange rates were also reported to be tightening. The opening price immediately hit the 5,800 yuan mark. Seeing the high price, silver firms took the opportunity to sell, and some even increased their selling. The price briefly retreated to 5,772 yuan, but as foreign exchange weakened, sentiment shifted upwards, and buying surged again, pushing the price up to 5,852 yuan. Eventually, retail investors sold, and the closing price was 5,838 yuan, up 75 yuan. Cash prices were not available. Jewelry gold was listed at ten yuan higher. Customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Rises 75 Yuan</p>
<p>The price initially fluctuated by over thirty yuan. Gold shops entered silver firms with 20 taels at 5,800 yuan. After opening, the market was sluggish, and silver firms sold. The price retreated within 800 yuan. Securities firms sold 30 taels to gold shops for 5,772 yuan. Shortly after, foreign exchange rates contracted, and sentiment shifted upwards. Buyers gathered, pushing the price up to 5,852 yuan. Securities firms bought 20 taels from silver firms. The price then rose to Securities firms and silver firms were the most aggressive buyers. Later, as retail investors took profits, the upward momentum stalled. Silver firms sold 30 taels to gold shops for 5,835 yuan. The price at the close was 5,838 yuan, up 75 yuan from the previous day, with a fluctuation of 80 yuan during the half-day. The selling price for cash gold from bullion dealers was over ten yuan higher, and the buying price was thirty yuan lower. The current mark gold was fifty or sixty yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was no trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Suspended at 600 Yuan</p>
<p>Jewelry gold was sold for ten yuan more per tael. Da Tong Hang suspended at 600 yuan. New Tong Hang was similar to the previous price, with buying prices around thirty yuan lower.</p>
<h3>Most Foreign Currencies Increased</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market did not have formal quotes due to special circumstances. However, off-exchange asking prices showed that most major currencies had increased. British and American gold pounds rose by two yuan each, following the gold price. British gold notes also rose by five jiao. U.S. dollar notes were quoted as high as 17.4 yuan, which was 2.7 jiao higher than the previous day. There were no other changes. Japanese gold notes remained at 1.54 yuan. Korean notes were trending upwards, slightly higher in the evening at 1.185 yuan.</p>
<p>Interbank Transfer Interest Rate Also Reduced Last Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association's Joint Preparatory Committee set the interbank transfer deposit interest rate for November at 2 yuan per thousand yuan (equivalent to a monthly interest rate of two tenths, 1 yuan lower than October).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Fabric: Yarn Market Prices Not Published, Activity Resumes After Open Market</h3>
<p>The Shuang Ma spot yarn market yesterday morning was full of rumors, saying that the issue of Chinese constables requesting increased allowances had caused many rumors. It was said that financial settlements were difficult and that procedures were more difficult after buying and selling. Everyone agreed that it would be best not to trade. After struggling until after 9:30, there was no effective resolution. It was heard that foreign exchange rates opened and the gold market was also operating normally. At 20 minutes past, the Shuang Ma shouts were suppressed. The price was 1,230 yuan and ten bales were traded. However, sellers then surged again, falling to 1,2234 yuan, with slight trading. After that, there was a stalemate. It was soon 11:00 and everyone dispersed. Therefore, the market price list was not published due to the small number of trades. Hong Kong merchant sales office had activity. The final price for 20-count Shuang Ma yarn that day was 1,225 yuan and ten bales were traded.</p>
<p>After the market closed, in the yarn and cloth exchange, because foreign exchange contracted by 0.03125, sentiment was greatly encouraged. 20-count Shuang Ma was traded at 1,235 yuan, and there was talk that it was temporarily unavailable, but around 3 o'clock, someone sold it, and it relaxed slightly.</p>
<p>Also, on the 30th, 909 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, and today (1st), 670 bales were also shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>White Bales, Fire Kindling, Cotton: Chinese Factories All Have Demand</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation has improved slightly, because Chinese factories have demand for both white bales and rough bales, while other types remain sluggish, so sentiment has improved. However, Japanese factories have very little activity, and the industry is generally calm. As a result, the market price has not changed significantly, but it is gradually firming. The price of fire kindling rough bales is 2067 yuan, with a 4 yuan delivery fee to the factory. Taicang cotton is 214 yuan. Also, on the 1st, 825 bales of cotton were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The foreign cotton market price: The New York cotton market rose slightly in the early morning due to purchases by industry peers, but then the closing price fell by five points due to sales on Wall Street and the liquidation of some long positions. India rose by two rupees yesterday.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai have been consistently quiet recently, with weak purchase interest from all parties and a wait-and-see attitude. Factories have sufficient inventory to meet current needs due to the lack of improvement in the yarn market, so there are no temporary transactions.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous: Shaoxing Wine Soars, Bottled Wine at 2.5 Yuan</h3>
<p>Shaoxing wine can only be transported in small quantities via Zhapu, resulting in a daily depletion of Shanghai's Shaoxing wine inventory. After hoarders scrambled to purchase and stockpile, market prices have been rising daily. Before the lockdown, the highest selling price for 50-jin packages of Jingzhuang wine was only 22 yuan. Shortly after the lockdown, the black market price quickly rose to 24 to 26 yuan. On August 1st, the Wine Industry Association decided to change the listed market price to 28 yuan. However, within a month, the black market rose again, from 28 to 29, 30, to 334 yuan. Recently, starting from December 1st, the Wine Industry Association again revised the listed market price to 36 yuan per. However, the black market price increase among industry peers was even more severe, exceeding the regulated market price and rising as high as 38 to 40 yuan. At the same time, the peak price of 1.8 yuan per bottle of bottled Huadiao wine rose to 2.5 yuan. As for Jiangsu wine, the price has skyrocketed. Within a few days, the black market price has jumped from the market price of 21 yuan per can to 267 yuan. (Yan)</p>
<h3>Textiles: Woolen Fabrics Muted</h3>
<p>Recently, the number of customers in the woolen fabric market, whether wholesale or retail, is not as prosperous as before. In fact, it has decreased by one-third, or even by half. The main reason is that the price of goods has risen sharply in recent days, which has weakened many buyers. However, the woolen fabric market remains stable and does not fall. This is related to the situation, cost, and price of other goods.</p>
<h3>Financial Review</h3>
<p>— Sheng Kaiqiong</p>
<p>——November 30th——</p>
<p>Recent Developments in the Foreign Exchange Market</p>
<p>Since the end of September, when the United States provided a loan of US$25 million to China, the exchange rate in the Shanghai black market has been greatly beneficial to China's war of resistance due to the development of the international situation. The exchange rate has taken the end of September as a turning point. The US dollar rose from 5.50 yuan on October X to 5.78 yuan on the 7th, 5.875 yuan on the 11th, and further jumped to 6.156 yuan on the 28th. From then on, before November 9th, it always hovered above the 6 yuan level. On November 11th, due to the visit of Soviet Union's Molotov to Germany, the market price suddenly dropped from 6.03 to 5.78, but gradually rose again to around 6 yuan. At the end of the month, due to blind speculators and self-disturbance, except for 5.75 yuan on the 29th, it generally stopped at 5.8125 yuan.</p>
<p>Reviewing the development of the exchange market before the end of the month, I deeply feel that the impact of Japan's "recognition" on the exchange market is far less powerful than the development of the international situation that is beneficial to China. The facts during this period prove that the seizure of the Shanghai Special Second District Court was considered by everyone to be a blow to the exchange market, but in fact, the US dollar only dropped by thirty-two parts of a cent, while the news of Molotov's visit to Germany caused the US dollar to fall abnormally by a quarter of a cent. After that, the rumor of the establishment of a certain bank, although rumored to be serious, could not withstand the difficult-to-improve tense relationship between the United States and Japan, and the impact of the huge new loan between the United States and China. Therefore, the market price rose from 5.875 yuan to 6 yuan.</p>
<p>Knowledgeable people are again poisoned, thinking that if this continues, the legal tender will become a problem again. In fact, there is no need to worry. Ignoring the "joint currency" in North China and the military tickets in Central China, after more than two years of promotion with dual pressure, they still cannot defeat the legal tender. Japan is inexplicably saddened and troubled by exporting materials to maintain the value of the "joint currency" and military tickets. Therefore, even if another kind of unprepared paper currency is added in Pingzhong, it is not a big deal, let alone whether it will be established or not is still an unknown X.</p>
<p>People who speculate on foreign exchange should understand a little. Since France allowed Japan to establish a military base in Saigon, Japan's southward advance has become more active, which means that Japan's friction with Britain and the United States is becoming more intense. Sooner or later (certainly not far away), the war in the South Pacific will erupt like a volcano. The rise in the price of legal tender will certainly not be affected by financial circles or occasional new accidents. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Children's Weekly</p>
<h3>My Hopes for My Children</h3>
<p>— Lu Gaoyi</p>
<p>Recently, the Youth Association held a Youth Moral, Intellectual, Physical, and Social Education Week. On the last day, a parents and children banquet was held. During the banquet, representatives from both parents and children gave speeches. The children's speech was on "My Hopes for My Parents." This article is what the author said on behalf of the parents, which may be welcomed by the children who read this publication.</p>
<p>When new-style schools were first established in China, there was often a special situation where fathers and sons studied in the same school. It is said that one day a father and son disagreed with each other. The father said, "You need to know that I gave birth to you." The son said, "I know, but you only gave birth to my body, not my mind." The father was a little angry after hearing this and said, "You can't say that. If you say it again, I will hit you." The son said, "If you hit me, then I will go tell the teacher."</p>
<p>We do not ask whether this story is true or false. What we should pay attention to is that the son's reason is indeed better than the father's reason.</p>
<p>We parents often have a prejudice, thinking that children are always inferior to us. In fact, sometimes children are indeed better than us, and they should be better than us because the next generation must be better than the previous generation for this world to progress; otherwise, human wisdom will only be transmitted less and less, not accumulated more and more.</p>
<p>Therefore, my hope for my children is not to hope for anything else, but only to hope that they will be able to surpass me at all times and in all aspects in the future. Today is the closing meeting of Youth Moral, Intellectual, Physical, and Social Education Week. I hope that the knowledge they have gained in this Youth Moral, Intellectual, Physical, and Social Education Week will be promoted and developed in a balanced manner in the future. In terms of what China needs most at present, I hope that in the future, my children will have greater compassion than us in terms of moral education, more specialized practical skills than us in terms of intellectual education, more endurance than us in terms of physical education, and more disciplined habits than us in terms of social education.</p>
<p>Because I speak very simply, I only have one hope, which is to hope that all the children will be better than their own parents in the future and that they will be able to achieve that the next generation is better than the previous generation in all four aspects of education. I hope that the children will easily remember this.</p>
<h3>The Miracle of Taking the Elevator</h3>
<p>— Su Ming</p>
<p>One afternoon last week, Yong'er's mother took him and his brother to a large company to buy some things for winter. When they got there, they found out that they had to go to the third floor to buy them, so they had to take the elevator. In a blink of an eye, they were on the third floor, and they quickly bought what they wanted. When taking the elevator down, Yong'er discovered a miracle. He kept silent about it until he got home, and then he said to his brother, "Brother, have you ever discovered any miracles when the elevator is going down?" His brother was very surprised to hear this. What miracles could there be in the elevator? Of course, he replied that he had not discovered anything.</p>
<p>"You didn't discover anything? But I did. When I was standing in the elevator and it started to go down, I felt a strange sensation. I felt that my body was very light, as if a person was falling freely from a valley into the sea. When the elevator reached the ground, I didn't even feel that the elevator had stopped, and my body could hardly step on the ground immediately because I only felt that my body was very light. After a while, this strange feeling disappeared. Brother, what is the reason for this? Can you feel it?"</p>
<p>"This is because you rarely take the elevator. I felt it the first time I took it, but later I gradually got used to it, and I didn't feel anything. You explained this reason very well. Let me tell you: When you stand still in the elevator, when the elevator goes down, speed occurs. Because of the earth's gravity, your motionless body follows the elevator's descent, and the speed of your body is certainly not as fast as the speed of the elevator. However, the difference is very small. If you analyze it carefully, your body and the elevator are separated once when the elevator goes down, as if you are suspended in the air. However, the degree of separation from the elevator is very small, so we feel light and floating. From this, we can know that an object cannot be weighed at the moment of descent. In other words, a descending object has no weight, but after reaching the ground, it regains its original weight. If you don't believe me, I can try it for you. Go get a wooden stick without any fine texture, and put two plates of the same weight on both ends of the stick. Put a pair of wire pliers for baking bread in one plate, and hang one plier leg on the end of the stick. Put stones in the other plate to balance the weight on both sides. Then strike a match and burn the string. The suspended plier leg will fall into the plate. What kind of change will occur in the balanced wooden stick at this time? When the suspended plier leg is falling? The wooden stick will still remain balanced. If you say that the wooden stick will not move at all, that is not necessarily true because when the two plier legs are combined, some pressure will be added, so the balance of the wooden stick will not be as stable as before. However, the difference is not very large." This experiment was done for a long time.</p>
<h3>Shirley Temple's Autobiography (24)</h3>
<p>— Min</p>
<p>The next day, we arrived in Honolulu. When we looked at Honolulu from the ship, it looked like a little bird perched on the water's edge. But as our ship got closer and closer, it got bigger and bigger. Finally, I saw many trees along the coast, and I also saw waves crashing on the white sand of the beach. But then, as we got closer, a strange phenomenon occurred. I saw a large pile of things on the shore, mixed together, like flags, flowers, clothes, and the faces of men and women. Do you know what this is? It turned out to be a large group of men and women. I guessed that something big must have happened.</p>
<p>My father said to me, "I think the crowd on the shore must be waiting to see one of the passengers on this ship." Haha, you would never guess that the person they wanted to see was not someone else, but me!</p>
<p>How did I know? Because they started raising their voices and shouting my name. I waved to them from the deck. When our ship docked, they cheered even louder. Every face was smiling, clearly happy to see me. It turned out that they all knew me, but I didn't know them. Now I didn't know what to say to these unknown friends, especially since there were so many of them, which really embarrassed me.</p>
<p>Then, our group went to the governor's residence. Oh, there were even more friends welcoming me in front of the gate of the governor's mansion, even more than the large group of people on the pier! We went into the mansion, and while we were talking to the governor, people outside were still shouting loudly, asking me to come out and see them. We were very grateful for their kindness, so my mother and father took my hand and walked to the gatehouse. The crowd below shouted "Good!" in unison. They also asked me to sing a song. My mother whispered to me, "Honey, sing 'Good Ship Lollipop'. I know they will definitely like it." I was asked to sing this song four times in a row, which shows how much they loved to listen to it!</p>
<h3>Remembering a Passionate Classmate</h3>
<p>— Huang Hansheng</p>
<p>In the past three years of war, I don't know how many young students have been lost. They all sacrificed themselves for the revival of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Now I am writing about our classmate Wu Hongwei. His hometown is Rugao County, Jiangsu Province. He is 21 years old. In the spring of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, he worked as an apprentice in the type casting department of Shen Bao for a three-year term. He was given the four words "Diligence, Thrift, Simplicity, and Practicality" by the manager to encourage him. This shows his personality.</p>
<p>In addition to his professional work, he also attended the Sixth Chinese Vocational Supplementary School to continue his studies. His grades were always among the best, which was admired by all the teachers and students of the school.</p>
<p>Usually, in addition to liking entertainment such as harmonica, flute, singing, chess, and table tennis, he also edited the wall newspaper, which was welcomed by general readers. At the same time, he received warnings. But he was not afraid and still took the risk without changing his ways.</p>
<p>His father was shot and killed in the 27th year of the Republic of China. He was heartbroken when he heard the bad news and almost wanted to die. This summer, he left his loving old mother and two younger brothers and sisters, changed his name to Wu Guang, and quit his job to join the army.</p>
<p>It is said that he was too active on the Beijing-Shanghai line, which led to his tragic death under the knife the other day. When this news reached our school, everyone mourned him.</p>
<p>On November 8th, many classmates and comrades held a memorial service for this passionate classmate Wu Hongwei at ×× School. When I looked at his remains, I couldn't help but shed tears. The order of the meeting was solemn and mournful.</p>
<p>Alas! How admirable is such a brave young man who loves his country and avenges his father's death.</p>
<p>Elementary School Student Summer Homework Competition, Senior Level, Fifth Place</p>
<h3>Hometown</h3>
<p>— Chengzhong Elementary School, Ye Runfu</p>
<p>Whenever the night is quiet, I always recall my beautiful hometown, and gradually, I fall into a dream.</p>
<p>A fiery sun has been sinking to the west for a long time. The inky black sky gradually reveals a bright moon. It emits a faint glow, replacing the sun's responsibility. But it is not as violent as the sun. It gently caresses people. The people who worked hard during the day seem to have already thrown their hard work to the clouds. Everyone's face is showing a smile, chatting about what they experienced during the day.</p>
<p>At this time, I am wandering alone in the park. The fragrance of lotus flowers brought by the gentle breeze makes me look up. I see the lotus flowers in the small pond on the opposite side, as if wearing a pink new dress, becoming even more charming and moving. The lush green lotus leaves next to them are leisurely floating on the water. "Ah! What a beautiful picture!" I exclaim.</p>
<p>Quiet, beautiful environment surrounds my entire hometown. In front of our house, there are many large trees that can be hugged, and various wildflowers. Around the house, there are several high mountains. The mountain streams echo with the "gurgling..." sound of springs, which is very elegant. Mulberry forests and fish ponds are arranged in an orderly manner. How beautiful and picturesque this is!</p>
<p>These are just fantasies. In fact, this beautiful place has long been ravaged by the terrible god of war. Alas! Who is to blame for this? When I wake up, recalling the scenery of my hometown and comparing it with the present, I can't help but ask such a question.</p>

<h3>The Mysterious Carpet</h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>When we step into any movie theater, don't we always see carpets laid out in the hallways or along the aisles? What is the relationship between carpets and movies? Most of you probably don't know. Today, I'm going to tell you—when ordinary light reflects off a carpet, no matter how faint the light is, if a colorful film is being projected on the screen at the same time, it is absolutely detrimental to our visual experience. To remedy this shortcoming, the invention of the "Magic Carpet" has now emerged. The reason it's called "mysterious" is, of course, because it has something special about it. But if we break it down, it's just a new scientific success. It still uses ordinary carpets (except those whose dyes contain fluorescent components), and makes them reflect ultraviolet light. In other words, lamps that emit ultraviolet light are installed around the inside of the theater. In this way, ordinary carpets can shine with very soft, various colors in the dark, and the above-mentioned shortcomings can be avoided. The improvement of carpets has a direct impact on the film itself, which moviegoers probably wouldn't have guessed!</p>
<h3>China Cartoon Society Prepares to Film a Full-Color Cartoon: "Old Stupid Dog's Hungry Days" to Meet Movie Fans</h3>
<p>Since Walt Disney's "Snow White" was released, cartoons have established a solid foundation in the art world because such films not only achieve the highest artistic effect but also bear the mission of education and are extremely influential on the general audience, especially women and children. In our country, cartooning has not been able to gain a foothold in the film market for some time due to insufficient material conditions. Until recently, it is gratifying that the China Cartoon Society has emerged as an independent entity.</p>
<p>Regarding the China Cartoon Society, its predecessor was the Student Cartoon Society, organized by young people with artistic cultivation. Later, it was renamed the China Cartoon Society in preparation for expanding its scope. The first maiden work, "Old Stupid Dog's Hungry Days," has been revised three times and is now completed. Currently, it is negotiating for screening locations, and when the time is ripe, it will be able to meet us.</p>
<p>Recently, they are working on their second project and have decided on a grand plan: to produce the second project in full color. Although full-color cartoons are not surprising to us, they are limited to foreign productions. In the history of Chinese cinema, it is at least a precious page! (Leng Bai)</p>
<p>Brief News: From 8:00 AM to 2:00 AM on the 3rd of this month, all radio stations in Shanghai will broadcast unprecedentedly grand and wonderful programs. All storytelling, Shanghai opera, comedy, Peking opera, songs, and Western music will feature first-class masters. It is especially noteworthy that Guo Chunyang, the famous bearded actor who has not visited Shanghai for a long time and recently went south to visit relatives, and Ms. Yao Suqiu, a famous amateur performer, have generously agreed to broadcast their signature masterpieces, accompanied by Yao Bolin, a Ping opera musician, on the qin, which is even more precious. Please also pay attention to the large advertisements in the Sino-Singapore newspapers on that day.</p>
<p>Another News: Yan Hua of "Tang Bohu," since entering the film industry, has rarely been involved in the singing world. Recently, he and Mr. Li Qiniu co-edited a new song for the film city, the content of which is quite wonderful.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Moves to Chongqing</h3>
<p>— Jiao Chao</p>
<p>One scene from the Central Film Studio's new film "Ten Thousand Miles of Long Sky" is the "Wind and Cloud Cafe" on the lakeside of Hangzhou. In the picture are the four air force heroes (from left): Gu Er'yi, Gao Zhanfei, Jin Yan, and Shi Chao.</p>
<p>Hawthorne's Investigation</p>
<h3>The Ballerina's Fate</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 12: Report and Explanation</p>
<p>"I said before, money is the main cause, and marriage is the secondary cause. Because of Shouqi's rash actions last night, this matter has been strained. Although Lilan once suggested using money to dissolve the engagement, this suggestion will inevitably not be fulfilled due to Shouqi's actions. The result is the loss of both the person and the money. This is of course something Li Zhiban is unwilling to accept. So the thought of murder began to stir in this old man's heart."</p>
<p>"You all saw that the old man's pair of dark eyes were bright and spirited, showing that he had considerable courage. Since he had the intention to commit the crime and obtained a coincidental opportunity, his determination to murder was completely established."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou asked, "The opportunity you are talking about, is it referring to the fact that the old man witnessed Yu Gantang and Zhao Boxiong arguing with each other on the day he arrived in Shanghai?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne nodded and said, "Yes, this is a remote cause; the proximate cause is that yesterday morning, he sent his son to the train and heard Lilan arguing with Yu Gantang on the phone again. The old man must have heard the intimidating words Yu Gantang said. Because Old Mao said that it was Li Zhiban who persuaded Lilan to go upstairs at that time. He felt that since Lilan's environment was so complicated, and he himself was a villager, people would definitely not suspect him if he caused this case. Therefore, he resolutely made up his mind to commit this heinous crime that night."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou nodded repeatedly, believing that Hawthorne's hypothesis was very reasonable. He also said, "Mr. Hawthorne, why don't you tell us about the process of his committing the crime as well?"</p>
<p>Before Hawthorne could answer, the doorbell rang. Ni Jinshou answered the phone and listened, then answered a few short sentences, and put the phone down. His face also darkened.</p>
<p>He said, "It's over. This is a call from Dean Xu of the Public Security Hospital. The old man is done for."</p>
<p>Hawthorne sighed softly. "If he could have endured the hardship of a simple teaching life and not been tempted by material things, he might still be living a peaceful village life at this moment!" This was followed by another sigh. (182)</p>
