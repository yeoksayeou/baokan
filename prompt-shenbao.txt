Provide a careful English translation of the below section of a historical Chinese newspaper 申報 in traditional Chinese characters. 
DO NOT LEAVE any of the original Chinese in your translation. TRANSLATE IT FULLY, including subsection headers and headlines. 
Article titles found are after ### and these titles should preserve that header formatting. 
Do not add new '###' where they did not exist in the original file, only use that when it existed in the original file. 
Do not offer changes or corrections to the original, or any other comments. Just do the translation.
Translate everything into English and preserve whitespace where found:
